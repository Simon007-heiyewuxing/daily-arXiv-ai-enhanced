### [1] [Characterizing Motion Encoding in Video Diffusion Timesteps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22175)
*Vatsal Baherwani,Yixuan Ren,Abhinav Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过注入条件并量化外观-运动的权衡，系统识别出扩散退噪轨迹中的运动与外观主导时段，并利用运动主导时段约束训练与推理，实现简单高效的运动迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频扩散模型中，如何在退噪时序上编码并分配运动与外观信息尚不清晰；从业者使用早期负责运动、后期负责外观的经验启发式尚未被系统刻画，限制了运动迁移与编辑方法的设计与优化。

Method: 定义通过在特定时间步范围内注入新条件来测量外观编辑与运动保持的权衡，进行大规模定量实验，比较多种架构下沿退噪轨迹的表现，绘制运动-外观竞争的映射并确定临界时序边界；基于此边界，提出仅在运动主导阶段进行训练与推理的简化一镜头运动定制策略。

Result: 在不同架构上均一致发现了早期运动主导与后期外观主导的时序分区，提出的时序约束训练/推理策略在保留运动传递能力的同时无需额外去偏模块或专门目标，简化并有效提升了一镜头运动定制的实用性。

Conclusion: 本文通过在扩散时序上注入条件并观察外观编辑与运动保持之间的权衡，提出了一个代理量化运动在不同时刻的编码，从而识别出早期以运动为主、后期以外观为主的时序分区，并据此在运动主导时段约束训练与推理，实现无额外模块或特殊目标的高效运动迁移。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models synthesize temporal motion and spatial appearance through iterative denoising, yet how motion is encoded across timesteps remains poorly understood. Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture combining 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The system processes webcam video streams to recognize word-level ASL signs, addressing communication barriers for over 70 million deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals worldwide. Our architecture leverages 3D convolutions to capture spatial-temporal features from video frames, followed by LSTM layers that model sequential dependencies inherent in sign language gestures. Trained on the WLASL dataset (2,000 common words), ASL-LEX lexical database (~2,700 signs), and a curated set of 100 expert-annotated ASL signs, the system achieves F1-scores ranging from 0.71 to 0.99 across sign classes. The model is deployed on AWS infrastructure with edge deployment capability on OAK-D cameras for real-time inference. We discuss the architecture design, training methodology, evaluation metrics, and deployment considerations for practical accessibility applications.

### [4] [Unbiased Visual Reasoning with Controlled Visual Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22183)
*Zhaonan Li,Shijie Lu,Fei Wang,Jacob Dineen,Xiao Ye,Zhikun Xu,Siyi Liu,Young Min Cho,Bangzheng Li,Daniel Chang,Kenny Nguyen,Qizheng Yang,Muhao Chen,Ben Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过把视觉感知限制为简短客观查询并让文本LLM负责规划与综合，VISTA用信息瓶颈和强化学习减少VLM对虚假关联的依赖，显著提升视觉推理鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端视觉语言模型常利用虚假相关性而非因果视觉证据来回答问题，且微调后更易产生shortcut。需要一种机制将视觉感知与语言推理解耦，以强制模型基于客观视觉证据进行推理。

Method: 将冻结的VLM作为感知传感器，仅允许其回答短且客观的视觉查询；使用文本LLM作为推理器，负责分解问题、规划查询并以自然语言聚合视觉事实；通过基于奖励的环境（GRPO强化学习）训练推理器以减少偏差。

Result: 在仅用641条精心设计的多步问题训练下，VISTA在SpuriVerse上对抗真实世界虚假相关性的鲁棒性显著提升（Qwen-2.5-VL-7B提升+16.29%，Llama-3.2-Vision-11B提升+6.77%），在MMVP及SeedBench平衡子集上仍具竞争力；此外可跨未见传感器迁移并能识别/恢复感知失败。人类评估显示VISTA推理轨迹更中性、更少依赖虚假属性且更显式基于视觉证据。

Conclusion: VISTA通过在感知与推理间引入信息瓶颈并将视觉输入限定为简短客观的查询，能有效减少VLM依赖数据中虚假关联的倾向，从而提升视觉推理的鲁棒性。

Abstract: End-to-end Vision-language Models (VLMs) often answer visual questions by exploiting spurious correlations instead of causal visual evidence, and can become more shortcut-prone when fine-tuned. We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis further shows that VISTA's reasoning traces are more neutral, less reliant on spurious attributes, and more explicitly grounded in visual evidence than end-to-end VLM baselines.

### [5] [SAMM2D: Scale-Aware Multi-Modal 2D Dual-Encoder for High-Sensitivity Intracrania Aneurysm Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22185)
*Antara Titikhsha,Divyanshu Tak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAMM2D双编码器用于颅内动脉瘤检测，在RSNA数据集上AUC=0.686，比临床基线提高32%。重要发现：在强预训练骨干下，任何数据增强反而降低性能；未增强基线优于所有增强版本1.75–2.23个百分点（p<0.01）。通过阈值校准达95%敏感性，超越平均放射科医师，并在筛查中每1000名患者节省约1390万美元。Grad-CAM显示85%真阳性关注血管区域，IoU与专家注释62%。结论是强预训练比复杂增强更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动脉瘤检测因形态微妙、类别严重不平衡和标注数据稀缺而困难；需探索在低数据场景下提升检测性能的有效策略。

Method: 提出双编码器SAMM2D架构；在RSNA颅内动脉瘤数据集上训练并评估AUC、灵敏度，进行六种增强策略的消融对比；使用阈值校准以提高灵敏度；用Grad-CAM评估关注区域与专家注释的一致性；统计显著性检验（p<0.01）。

Result: SAMM2D达AUC=0.686，较临床基线提升32%；未使用任何数据增强的模型优于所有增强方案（提升1.75–2.23个百分点，p<0.01）；在阈值调整下达到95%灵敏度，Grad-CAM显示85%真阳性关注血管区域（62% IoU）；估计筛查阶段每1000患者节省约13.9M美元。

Conclusion: 强预训练的特征在低样本医学影像中比复杂数据增强更关键；过度或不当增强可能破坏预训练学习到的稳健不变性，从而降低模型性能。

Abstract: Effective aneurysm detection is essential to avert life-threatening hemorrhages, but it remains challenging due to the subtle morphology of the aneurysm, pronounced class imbalance, and the scarcity of annotated data. We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that "more augmentation is always better" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions (62% IoU with expert annotations), demonstrating the model's clinically meaningful focus. Our results suggest that future medical imaging workflows could benefit more from strong pretraining than from increasingly complex augmentation pipelines.

### [6] [HookMIL: Revisiting Context Modeling in Multiple Instance Learning for Computational Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22188)
*Xitong Ling,Minxi Ouyang,Xiaoxiao Li,Jiawen Li,Ying Chen,Yuxuan Sun,Xinrui Chen,Tian Guan,Xiaoping Liu,Yonghong He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HookMIL，一种使用可学习钩子（hook tokens）进行结构化上下文聚合的高效多实例学习框架，支持从视觉补丁、视觉-语言文本嵌入和空间转录组视觉特征多模态初始化，采用双向线性注意力与钩子间通信和多样性损失，提升性能、效率与可解释性。

Result: 在四个公开病理数据集上，HookMIL取得了SOTA或接近SOTA的效果，同时显著降低计算成本并提升模型可解释性，代码已开源。

Conclusion: HookMIL在四个公开病理数据集上达到或优于现有最先进方法，同时显著降低计算复杂度并增强可解释性，证明了多模态钩子初始化、线性双向注意力和钩子多样性约束在WSI弱监督分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has enabled weakly supervised analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability. Codes are available at https://github.com/lingxitong/HookMIL.

### [7] [Tiny-YOLOSAM: Fast Hybrid Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22193)
*Kenneth Xu,Songhan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Use detector-guided box prompts plus sparse point sampling to make TinySAM fast and effective for full-scene segmentation; large gains in coverage and speed on COCO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost of promptable segmentation (SAM/TinySAM) for latency-critical settings while retaining zero-shot mask quality.

Method: Replicate TinySAM baseline on COCO val2017; combine YOLOv12 detector to produce box prompts for TinySAM on salient objects, then sample sparse point prompts only in regions not covered by YOLO-guided masks; measure AR, mIoU, runtime on Apple M1 Pro CPU.

Result: Proposed Tiny-YOLOSAM: use YOLOv12 to generate box prompts for TinySAM and supplement with sparse point prompts where detector masks absent; on COCO val2017 improves coverage (AR 16.4%->77.1%, mIoU 19.2%->67.8%) and speeds up runtime 4.7x on Apple M1 Pro.

Conclusion: Detector-guided prompting with targeted sparse sampling offers a practical and efficient alternative to dense segment-everything prompting for real-world full-scene segmentation.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) enables promptable, high-quality segmentation but is often too computationally expensive for latency-critical settings. TinySAM is a lightweight, distilled SAM variant that preserves strong zero-shot mask quality, yet its "segment-everything" mode still requires hundreds of prompts and remains slow in practice. We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU. These results suggest detector-guided prompting combined with targeted sparse sampling as an effective alternative to dense "segment-everything" prompting for practical full-scene segmentation.

### [8] [Quadrant Segmentation VLM with Few-Shot Adaptation and OCT Learning-based Explainability Methods for Diabetic Retinopathy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22197)
*Shivum Telang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于VLM的多模态少样本可解释模型，结合基金和OCT图像、渐进式CAM热图和象限分布分析，生成自然语言的定量病变检测，提升DR诊断可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current DR models lack interpretability beyond lesion maps, require manual lesion annotation, and are single-modality; clinicians need natural-language, quantitative lesion detection and reasoning across modalities.

Method: multimodal-VLM-fewshot-with-gradcam

Result: A multimodal explainability model using a visual-language model with few-shot learning, generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps for OCT and fundus, analyzes lesion distributions across retinal quadrants, and outputs natural-language lesion descriptions; evaluated on 3,000 fundus and 1,000 OCT images showing improved interpretability and practical diagnostic utility.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态、类医生推理机制与可视化激活图，解决了传统DR模型的可解释性与实用性限制，有望在筛查与临床决策中提高效果。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, requiring early detection to preserve sight. Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification. Using a dataset of 3,000 fundus images and 1,000 OCT images, this innovative methodology addresses key limitations in current DR diagnostics, offering a practical and comprehensive tool for improving patient outcomes.

### [9] [TCFormer: A 5M-Parameter Transformer with Density-Guided Aggregation for Weakly-Supervised Crowd Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22203)
*Qiang Guo,Rubo Zhang,Bingbing Zhang,Junjie Liu,Jianqing Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个仅5M参数的弱监督轻量级Transformer计数器（TCFormer），通过Density-Weighted Averaging模块和密度等级分类损失在仅用图像级计数标签下实现高效准确的人群计数，适合边缘设备部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少标注成本与计算资源需求，使人群计数模型适配边缘设备与弱监督场景，提升可扩展性与实用性。

Method: 采用轻量级视觉Transformer作为特征提取器，引入可学习的Density-Weighted Averaging模块动态按预测密度对局部token加权，以及密度等级分类损失来正则化训练；联合优化计数回归与密度分类损失。

Result: 在ShanghaiTech A/B、UCF-QNRF和NWPU等四个基准上，TCFormer在参数效率与计数精度之间取得良好平衡，表现接近或优于更大模型。

Conclusion: TCFormer在弱监督设置下通过联合预测总人数和密度等级，能在仅使用图像级计数标签的情况下实现竞争性的计数性能，且参数量仅为5M，适合部署于资源受限设备。

Abstract: Crowd counting typically relies on labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally intensive backbones, restricting its scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.

Conclusion: 自定义CNN在疟疾图像分类上表现优异且可解释性强，能够作为资源匮乏地区的辅助诊断工具，但仍需在更大规模和多样化数据上验证并关注真实临床部署问题。

Abstract: Malaria remains a prevalent health concern in regions with tropical and subtropical climates. The cause of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, which is transmitted through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as microscopic blood smear analysis, are low in sensitivity, depend on expert judgment, and require resources that may not be available in remote settings. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based approach utilizing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify blood cell images as parasitized or uninfected. The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes. This study also compares the custom CNN with established deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121. To enhance model interpretability, Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP, LIME, and Saliency Maps are applied. The proposed system shows how deep learning can provide quick, accurate and understandable malaria diagnosis, especially in areas with limited resources.

Conclusion: 本文提出Signal-SGN++，在拓扑感知的脉冲图网络中融合时频动态，实现高能效下的人体动作识别。

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) demonstrate strong capability in modeling skeletal topology for action recognition, yet their dense floating-point computations incur high energy costs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行人属性识别受类别极度不平衡、属性间复杂依赖和跨域泛化困难影响，传统方法难以同时解决这些问题；利用大规模视觉-语言预训练模型的语义对齐能力并加以轻量跨模态精炼，可提高对罕见属性的辨识与总体泛化能力。

Method: 采用冻结的SigLIP 2视觉和文本编码器，设计一个轻量级跨注意力融合模块对视觉特征进行细化并与提示嵌入对齐，最终通过分类头预测多标签属性。该模块在训练时更新少量参数，保持编码器不变以利用预训练泛化能力。

Result: VLM-PAR在PA100K、PETA、Market-1501等行人属性识别数据集上，通过在冻结的SigLIP 2多语种编码器上加入紧凑的跨注意力融合模块，实现了图像与提示（prompt）嵌入的对齐，从而显著提升了在高度不平衡数据上的识别准确率，达到了PA100K的新SOTA，并在PETA和Market-1501上提高了平均精度。

Conclusion: 将大规模视觉语言预训练与有针对性的跨模态精炼结合，可有效缓解行人属性识别中的类别不平衡和泛化问题，且不需微调整个编码器即可获得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) involves predicting fine-grained attributes such as clothing color, gender, and accessories from pedestrian imagery, yet is hindered by severe class imbalance, intricate attribute co-dependencies, and domain shifts. We introduce VLM-PAR, a modular vision-language framework built on frozen SigLIP 2 multilingual encoders. By first aligning image and prompt embeddings via refining visual features through a compact cross-attention fusion, VLM-PAR achieves significant accuracy improvement on the highly imbalanced PA100K benchmark, setting a new state-of-the-art performance, while also delivering significant gains in mean accuracy across PETA and Market-1501 benchmarks. These results underscore the efficacy of integrating large-scale vision-language pretraining with targeted cross-modal refinement to overcome imbalance and generalization challenges in PAR.

Motivation: 现有VQA研究对招牌文本与低资源语言支持不足，越南语招牌在双语、口语化、视觉布局上具有独特性，亟需大规模基准数据和OCR整合的模型以推动实际应用。

Method: 收集并标注越南语招牌图像，设计多样化问答，采用SwinTextSpotter提取OCR文本，使用ViT5语言模型进行微调，并将OCR文本作为附加上下文拼接到问题中。基线包括改造后的BLIP-2/LaTr/PreSTU/SaL；另提出多代理框架：感知代理负责视觉+OCR提取，推理代理（含GPT-4）进行答案生成与多数投票融合。

Result: ViSignVQA: large-scale Vietnamese signboard VQA dataset (10,762 images, 25,573 QA pairs). Benchmarks: adapted BLIP-2, LaTr, PreSTU, SaL with SwinTextSpotter OCR and ViT5 LM. OCR context drastically improves F1 up to 209%. Proposed multi-agent framework with GPT-4 achieves 75.98% accuracy via majority voting. Emphasizes need for domain-specific resources for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: ViSignVQA填补了越南语场景文本理解数据空白，证明在低资源语言中引入OCR和领域资源能大幅提升文本相关VQA性能，且多代理策略能进一步提高稳健性。

Abstract: Understanding signboard text in natural scenes is essential for real-world applications of Visual Question Answering (VQA), yet remains underexplored, particularly in low-resource languages. We introduce ViSignVQA, the first large-scale Vietnamese dataset designed for signboard-oriented VQA, which comprises 10,762 images and 25,573 question-answer pairs. The dataset captures the diverse linguistic, cultural, and visual characteristics of Vietnamese signboards, including bilingual text, informal phrasing, and visual elements such as color and layout. To benchmark this task, we adapted state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., BLIP-2, LaTr, PreSTU, and SaL) by integrating a Vietnamese OCR model (SwinTextSpotter) and a Vietnamese pretrained language model (ViT5). The experimental results highlight the significant role of the OCR-enhanced context, with F1-score improvements of up to 209% when the OCR text is appended to questions. Additionally, we propose a multi-agent VQA framework combining perception and reasoning agents with GPT-4, achieving 75.98% accuracy via majority voting. Our study presents the first large-scale multimodal dataset for Vietnamese signboard understanding. This underscores the importance of domain-specific resources in enhancing text-based VQA for low-resource languages. ViSignVQA serves as a benchmark capturing real-world scene text characteristics and supporting the development and evaluation of OCR-integrated VQA models in Vietnamese.

### [14] [On Extending Semantic Abstraction for Efficient Search of Hidden Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22220)
*Tasha Pais,Nikhilesh Belulkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用2D VLM的relevancy地图作为抽象对象表示，结合历史摆放数据进行无结构搜索，提高隐藏物体的3D定位效率，适用于家用机器人寻找丢失物品。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该论文利用2D视觉语言模型（VLM）的relevancy激活图作为‘抽象对象’表示，提出将其用于3D定位与补全隐藏对象（被部分遮挡导致VLM无法直接识别）。

Method: 将2D VLM relevancy地图视作抽象对象表示，基于此在3D空间中学习定位与形状补全策略；利用历史摆放数据构建搜索先验，从而在无结构搜索中优先选择高概率位置，减少尝试次数。

Result: 模型能够在第一次尝试时用远优于随机搜索的速度和准确度识别隐藏对象的完整3D位置。

Conclusion: 将语义抽象扩展到隐物体定位与补全，可显著加速和提高机器人搜索任务的效率，依靠relevancy地图与历史先验融合实现首次尝试的高成功率。

Abstract: Semantic Abstraction's key observation is that 2D VLMs' relevancy activations roughly correspond to their confidence of whether and where an object is in the scene. Thus, relevancy maps are treated as "abstract object" representations. We use this framework for learning 3D localization and completion for the exclusive domain of hidden objects, defined as objects that cannot be directly identified by a VLM because they are at least partially occluded. This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search. These extensions to semantic abstraction hope to provide household robots with the skills necessary to save time and effort when looking for lost objects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 VideoScaffold：包含弹性尺度事件分割（EES）和分层事件整合（HEC）的动态表示框架，可在流式视频中自适应调整事件粒度，实现从细粒度帧理解到抽象事件推理的平滑过渡，提升视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频流中帧冗余和需要时间一致表示的问题，使得MLLM能够在流式场景中保持细粒度语义同时具备抽象推理能力。

Method: EES进行预测引导的动态事件边界细化；HEC逐步将语义相关段聚合为多层次抽象。

Result: 在离线与流式视频理解基准上均达到最先进性能，框架模块化，可与现有图像级MLLM无缝结合，代码已开源。

Conclusion: VideoScaffold通过预测引导分割与分层聚合实现了在连续视频流中保留细节与形成抽象的平衡，证明了其在多种基准上的有效性与可扩展性。

Abstract: Understanding long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging due to the heavy redundancy across frames and the need for temporally coherent representations. Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension. The code is available at https://github.com/zheng980629/VideoScaffold.

### [16] [KAN-FPN-Stem:A KAN-Enhanced Feature Pyramid Stem for Boosting ViT-based Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22228)
*HaoNan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该工作指出ViT前端瓶颈在于多尺度特征融合质量而非注意力精炼，提出用KAN卷积替换FPN末端的线性平滑层以自适应修正融合伪影，从而在COCO上对ViTPose-S提升约2.0 AP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ViT前端（如ViTPose）采用的简单patchification导致对多尺度变换处理不足并在初始特征提取阶段造成不可逆信息损失，需要一种更强的前端融合与去伪影能力以提升密集预测效果。

Method: 对传统FPN保留上采样相加的融合结构，仅将终端平滑操作替换为KAN卷积；通过消融研究发现性能瓶颈在FPN的融合后非线性平滑步骤，而非可插拔注意力模块；在COCO数据集上以ViTPose-S为基线进行实验，验证KAN-FPN-Stem带来显著提升。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，KAN-FPN-Stem在轻量级ViTPose-S基线上最高带来约+2.0 AP的性能提升，表明该模块为即插即用的高性能前端改进手段。

Conclusion: 本文提出的KAN增强FPN-Stem通过在FPN的“upsample-and-add”融合流末端替换标准的3x3线性平滑卷积为具有强非线性建模能力的KAN卷积层，从而自适应修正多尺度融合过程中产生的伪影，显著提升了ViT前端在姿态估计等密集预测任务上的性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated significant promise in dense prediction tasks such as pose estimation. However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic "upsample-and-add" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the "artifacts" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.

*Mengxiao Geng,Ran Hong,Xiaoling Xu,Bingxuan Li,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MiG-DM combining patient meta-information and projection-domain physics in a cross-domain diffusion model, yielding better low-dose PET reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-dose PET reduces radiation but increases noise and degrades physiological details; existing methods ignore projection-domain physics and patient meta-information, limiting functional-semantic correlation mining.

Method: Meta-information guided diffusion for low-dose PET reconstruction (MiG-DM)

Result: MiG-DM integrates meta-information encoding and cross-domain (projection + image) diffusion, using sinogram adapter and semantic prompts; experiments on UDPET and clinical datasets show superior image quality and preserved details compared to SOTA.

Conclusion: Incorporating clinical meta-information and projection-domain priors via a synergistic diffusion framework improves low-dose PET image quality and physiological detail preservation, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Low-dose PET imaging is crucial for reducing patient radiation exposure but faces challenges like noise interference, reduced contrast, and difficulty in preserving physiological details. Existing methods often neglect both projection-domain physics knowledge and patient-specific meta-information, which are critical for functional-semantic correlation mining. In this study, we introduce a meta-information guided cross-domain synergistic diffusion model (MiG-DM) that integrates comprehensive cross-modal priors to generate high-quality PET images. Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering. Experiments on the UDPET public dataset and clinical datasets with varying dose levels demonstrate that MiG-DM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出将倒残差块与密集连接结合的轻量学生模型，采用硬标签、特征级、响应级与自我蒸馏相结合的多目标训练策略，在保持接近教师性能的情况下显著降低GFLOPs和参数量，适合硬件受限的智能农业部署。

Motivation: 解决农业边缘设备部署中计算资源受限与识别精度之间的折衷，开发既轻量又高性能的模型以便于现场实时应用。

Method: 构建由倒残差块与密集连接组成的学生网络；以ResNet18为教师，采用四种损失项组合（硬标签监督、特征级、响应级、自蒸馏）进行联合训练；在稻米品种与四个叶病数据集上验证性能。

Result: 该论文提出了一种面向资源受限农业边缘设备的混合知识蒸馏框架，通过设计轻量级学生网络并结合多层次蒸馏策略，实现计算效率与识别准确率的平衡。实验证明在稻米品种识别任务上，学生模型在参数量与计算量大幅减少的同时，准确率仅略低于教师模型，并在多种作物叶病数据集上保持良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 混合知识蒸馏结合定制轻量结构能在资源受限场景中有效压缩模型体积和计算复杂度，同时保持高精度，具有较强的泛化性与落地潜力。

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices remains a major challenge in smart agriculture due to the trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.

*Aahan Sachdeva,Dhanvinkumar Ganeshkumar,James E. Gallagher,Tyler Treat,Edward J. Oughton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种自适应RGB-LWIR视频融合框架，通过在多种融合比下训练和评估33个YOLO模型以应对不同光照条件，从而提升机器人在灾难救援等任务中的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB在低光条件下性能下降，而热成像（LWIR）缺乏颜色与纹理信息，单一模态不足以满足搜索与救援场景的鲁棒检测需求，因此需要融合两种模态并依据光照自适应选择模型。

Method: 收集并标注22000+张跨三种光照（无光、弱光、全光）的图像；将对齐的RGB与LWIR帧按11个比例（0%-100%步长10%）混合；在每种融合比和光照等级上分别训练YOLO系列模型（共33个模型）；通过平均置信度和与YOLOv5n/YOLOv11n基线比较评估性能。

Result: 在全光照和弱光条件下，80/20和90/10的融合策略分别达到92.8%和92.0%平均置信度，显著优于YOLOv5n/YOLOv11n基线；在无光条件下，40/60融合达到71.0%，超过基线但未达统计显著。

Conclusion: 在不同光照条件下，基于多比率自适应RGB-LWIR融合并动态选择最优检测模型，能显著提高检测置信度和可靠性；全光照（80/20融合）和弱光（90/10融合）下表现最好，无光照下40/60融合表现最佳。

Abstract: Autonomous robotic platforms are playing a growing role across the emergency services sector, supporting missions such as search and rescue operations in disaster zones and reconnaissance. However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant. Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improved detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HPE教师模型并将其梯度注入潜在扩散过程，以实现几何与风格的可控分离，显著提升文生图的几何一致性和语义对齐（约80%提升），并在多种架构上验证了方法的有效性与零样本形状迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是当前文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成高细节纹理，但常依赖表面外观，无法严格遵循几何约束，尤其当几何与文本暗示的风格冲突时，反映了生成模型与人类感知之间的语义差距。研究旨在探究是否可用轻量级外部判别器在不专门训练生成模型的情况下引入几何理解以缩小该差距。

Method: 提出训练在THINGS三元组数据集上的HPE教师模型以捕捉人类对物体形状的敏感性，并在潜在扩散生成过程中注入该教师模型的梯度来指导生成。对Stable Diffusion v1.5（U-Net）、流匹配模型SiT-XL/2和扩散Transformer PixArt-Σ三种架构进行了评估，分析连续指导的重要性及流模型的轨迹回归现象，并展示了零样本将复杂三维形状迁移到冲突材质的能力。

Result: 主要结果包括：在三种架构上验证了通过注入HPE梯度提高几何控制的可行性；发现流模型若无持续指导会回归默认轨迹；展示了复杂三维形状（如Eames椅）零样本迁移到冲突材质（如粉色金属）；相比无指导基线，语义对齐度提高约80%。

Conclusion: 本论文结论是：通过将轻量级、现成的判别器作为外部指导信号（Human Perception Embedding，HPE）注入到潜在扩散过程，可以在不进行专门训练的情况下引入几何理解，从而在风格与几何约束冲突时实现可控的几何与风格分离，显著提高语义对齐度并扩展文生图的创造范围。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate highly detailed textures, yet they often rely on surface appearance and fail to follow strict geometric constraints, particularly when those constraints conflict with the style implied by the text prompt. This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-Σ. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型常产生几何变形和遮挡不一致等伪影，缺乏可解释且能够同时检测两类问题的度量。

Method: 将残差运动与深度先验融合，计算几何对齐与遮挡一致性，输出密集一致性图谱；用于基准测试并作为训练无关的损失函数引导生成模型减少伪影。

Result: 在对近期视频生成模型的系统基准中，GeCo揭示了常见失败模式；作为引导损失时显著降低了几何变形伪影，提高了生成视频的几何一致性。

Conclusion: GeCo能有效检测并量化视频生成中几何变形和遮挡不一致性，帮助揭示模型常见失败模式，且作为训练无关的引导损失可降低变形伪影，从而改进视频生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce GeCo, a geometry-grounded metric for jointly detecting geometric deformation and occlusion-inconsistency artifacts in static scenes. By fusing residual motion and depth priors, GeCo produces interpretable, dense consistency maps that reveal these artifacts. We use GeCo to systematically benchmark recent video generation models, uncovering common failure modes, and further employ it as a training-free guidance loss to reduce deformation artifacts during video generation.

TL;DR: New orthopedic multimodal benchmark shows current models excel at multiple-choice but fail at complex multimodal clinical reasoning; VLMs prone to hallucinations; medical fine-tuning not enough


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks don't reflect integrated multimodal clinical reasoning needed in practice

Method: Developed B&J Benchmark and evaluated VLMs and LLMs

Result: High performance on multiple-choice tasks (>90%); poor performance (~60% or less) on open-ended multimodal tasks; VLMs struggle with image interpretation and exhibit text-driven hallucinations; medical-finetuned models show no consistent advantage

Conclusion: AI not yet clinically competent for complex multimodal reasoning; should be limited to supportive text roles until multimodal and visual understanding improve.

Abstract: Background: The rapid integration of foundation models into clinical practice and public health necessitates a rigorous evaluation of their true clinical reasoning capabilities beyond narrow examination success. Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding.

TL;DR: Fetal-Gauge: a large VQA benchmark (42k images, 93k QA) for fetal ultrasound; current VLMs perform poorly (best 55%); urgent need for domain-specific models and training; benchmark to spur research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing demand for prenatal ultrasound and shortage of trained sonographers; VLMs could assist interpretation but lack of standardized benchmark for fetal ultrasound hinders progress.

Method: Collected over 42k ultrasound images and 93k QA pairs covering five task categories; constructed a VQA benchmark; systematically evaluated several state-of-the-art general and medical VLMs and analyzed failure modes and performance gaps.

Result: Benchmark dataset and evaluation reveal substantial performance gaps in existing VLMs, with best accuracy 55%; identifies limitations and calls for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training; benchmark to be released.

Conclusion: This paper introduces Fetal-Gauge, the first large VQA benchmark for fetal ultrasound, showing that current state-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly (best 55% accuracy) and emphasizing need for domain-specific adaptation and training to meet clinical standards.

Abstract: The growing demand for prenatal ultrasound imaging has intensified a global shortage of trained sonographers, creating barriers to essential fetal health monitoring. Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches. Fetal-Gauge establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing multimodal deep learning in prenatal care and provides a pathway toward addressing global healthcare accessibility challenges. Our benchmark will be publicly available once the paper gets accepted.

Abstract: We introduce Uni4D, a unified framework for large scale open vocabulary 3D retrieval and controlled 4D generation based on structured three level alignment across text, 3D models, and image modalities. Built upon the Align3D 130 dataset, Uni4D employs a 3D text multi head attention and search model to optimize text to 3D retrieval through improved semantic alignment. The framework further strengthens cross modal alignment through three components: precise text to 3D retrieval, multi view 3D to image alignment, and image to text alignment for generating temporally consistent 4D assets. Experimental results demonstrate that Uni4D achieves high quality 3D retrieval and controllable 4D generation, advancing dynamic multimodal understanding and practical applications.

Conclusion: SirenPose通过整合周期表示、关键点几何先验和物理约束，配合大规模标注数据，能显著提升动态3D场景重建在快速运动和复杂场景中的时空一致性和精度。

Abstract: We propose SirenPose, a novel loss function that combines the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with geometric priors derived from keypoint structures to improve the accuracy of dynamic 3D scene reconstruction. Existing approaches often struggle to maintain motion modeling accuracy and spatiotemporal consistency in fast moving and multi target scenes. By introducing physics inspired constraint mechanisms, SirenPose enforces coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We further expand the training dataset to 600,000 annotated instances to support robust learning. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SirenPose achieve significant improvements in spatiotemporal consistency metrics compared to prior methods, showing superior performance in handling rapid motion and complex scene changes.

Abstract: In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者用预训练语义流+残余取证流的双分支网络，配合最差K扰动的红队训练和低成本测试时随机抖动，生成分类与弱监督热图，能在真实部署场景下对抗多种反取证处理并保持良好校准与可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实部署中伪造检测易受后处理与反取证攻撃破坏的问题，同时提供可靠校准概率与可操作的证据热图以便决策与人工复核。

Method: 双流架构：一流用预训练骨干编码语义，一流提取取证残差；通过轻量残差适配器融合用于分类，浅FPN风格头在弱监督下产生篡改热图。训练阶段使用红队策略：对每批样本施加最差K种反取证（JPEG重对齐与再压缩、重采样变形、去噪再颗粒、缝合平滑、微小色彩伽玛变化、社交应用转码等）。测试时防御为聚合多次带低廉抖动的预测（如尺寸/裁剪相位、轻微伽玛与JPEG相位变化）。热图通过人脸框掩码引导集中于人脸区域，免去像素级标注。

Result: 提出一种结合红队训练与随机化测试时防御的双流深度伪造与图像取证检测器，兼顾鲁棒性、概率校准与可解释热力图证据。

Conclusion: 该方法在标准与监控风格数据集上展现出对抗攻击下的稳健性、低校准误差、良好放弃策略和受控的性能下降，提供了数据高效且可部署的基线。

Abstract: This work presents an attack-aware deepfake and image-forensics detector designed for robustness, well-calibrated probabilities, and transparent evidence under realistic deployment conditions. The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores. Results demonstrate near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, and controlled degradation under regrain, establishing a modular, data-efficient, and practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps.

Motivation: 单张图像估计食物营养存在3D信息缺失，深度方法虽可靠但受限于手机深度传感器不可普及，需一种仅用RGB图像但能包含几何信息的方案。

Method: 采用双模态训练策略：一条使用点云的教师路径，一条使用RGB的学生路径；通过一个轻量级适配器网络使学生模仿点云表示，从而在无深度传感器的情况下实现伪3D推理。

Result: 在MetaFood3D上，PortionNet在体积和能量估计上优于此前所有方法；在SimpleFood45上进行的跨数据集评估显示其能量估计具有较强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate food nutrition estimation from single images is challenging due to the loss of 3D information. While depth-based methods provide reliable geometry, they remain inaccessible on most smartphones because of depth-sensor requirements. To overcome this challenge, we propose PortionNet, a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework that learns geometric features from point clouds during training while requiring only RGB images at inference. Our approach employs a dual-mode training strategy where a lightweight adapter network mimics point cloud representations, enabling pseudo-3D reasoning without any specialized hardware requirements. PortionNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on MetaFood3D, outperforming all previous methods in both volume and energy estimation. Cross-dataset evaluation on SimpleFood45 further demonstrates strong generalization in energy estimation.

Motivation: 目标是解决现有多主体视频生成模型在不同参考主体尺度导致的不自然生成（尺度不一致）以及参考顺序变化导致主体扭曲（置换敏感）的两大问题。

Method: 方法包括三部分：1) Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO)：基于大语言模型解析文本中尺度线索，并对特征进行尺度调制；2) Fourier Fusion：对参考图像特征进行FFT处理并融合频域信息，生成统一表示以减小输入顺序影响；3) Scale-Permutation Stability Loss：设计损失项同时约束尺度一致性与置换不变性。同时构建了受控基准用于评估。

Abstract: Multi-subject video generation aims to synthesize videos from textual prompts and multiple reference images, ensuring that each subject preserves natural scale and visual fidelity. However, current methods face two challenges: scale inconsistency, where variations in subject size lead to unnatural generation, and permutation sensitivity, where the order of reference inputs causes subject distortion. In this paper, we propose MoFu, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For scale inconsistency, we introduce Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO), an LLM-guided module that extracts implicit scale cues from the prompt and modulates features to ensure consistent subject sizes. To address permutation sensitivity, we present a simple yet effective Fourier Fusion strategy that processes the frequency information of reference features via the Fast Fourier Transform to produce a unified representation. Besides, we design a Scale-Permutation Stability Loss to jointly encourage scale-consistent and permutation-invariant generation. To further evaluate these challenges, we establish a dedicated benchmark with controlled variations in subject scale and reference permutation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoFu significantly outperforms existing methods in preserving natural scale, subject fidelity, and overall visual quality.

*Yang Ding,Yizhen Zhang,Xin Lai,Ruihang Chu,Yujiu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoZoomer lets MLLMs iteratively 'zoom' into important video moments, combining supervised imitation and RL to learn when to fetch high-frame-rate clips, improving long video reasoning and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs struggle with long video understanding because of limited context window and static sampling misses critical frames; need dynamic focus.

Method: Start with low-frame-rate overview, use a temporal zoom tool to request high-frame-rate clips at selected times in multi-turn reasoning; train with supervised fine-tuning on curated exemplar/reflection trajectories then refine policy with reinforcement learning.

Result: VideoZoomer enables dynamic temporal zooming from coarse overview to high-frame-rate clips at chosen moments; two-stage training (supervised fine-tuning on distilled trajectories, then RL); 7B model shows strong performance, diverse reasoning, surpasses open-source and rivals proprietary systems, efficient under reduced frame budgets.

Conclusion: Agentic temporal zooming and two-stage training produce emergent long-video reasoning capabilities, outperforming prior open-source models and matching proprietary ones with fewer frames.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in vision-language tasks yet remain limited in long video understanding due to the limited context window. Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.

TL;DR: SpotEdit 在扩散 Transformer 编辑中只对修改区域进行更新，通过区域选择与动态融合减少冗余计算并保护未变区域，提升效率与精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出在扩散 Transformer 图像编辑中，避免对未修改区域进行重复计算与去噪，提升效率并保护未改动部分的质量。

Method: 提出两个模块：SpotSelector 使用感知相似度识别并复用稳定区域特征；SpotFusion 通过动态融合机制混合复用特征与编辑令牌，保持上下文一致性与编辑质量。

Result: 提出 SpotEdit 框架：包括 SpotSelector（通过感知相似度识别稳定区域并复用条件图像特征）和 SpotFusion（动态融合编辑后令牌与复用特征），实现只更新修改区域的训练无监督编辑，减少计算并保持未改动区域高保真度。

Conclusion: 通过选择性跳过稳定区域的计算并动态融合特征，SpotEdit 实现了训练无监督、计算更高效且保持高质量未修改区域的图像编辑。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models have significantly advanced image editing by encoding conditional images and integrating them into transformer layers. However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.

TL;DR: 该文提出DeMoGen，一种基于能量的扩散模型的可组合分解训练范式，用于将整体动作分解为语义子组件，从而发现并重用动作原语，三种训练变体（Exp, OSS, SC）促进分解学习，并构建了文本分解数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作侧重正向建模（文本到动作或从概念集组合），缺乏将整体动作逆向分解为语义子组件的方法，分解有助于发现可复用的动作原语并支持更灵活的组合与生成。

Method: 提出能量基的扩散模型框架来建模多个动作概念的组合分布；设计三种训练策略：DeMoGen-Exp（显式分解文本训练）、DeMoGen-OSS（正交自监督分解）、DeMoGen-SC（语义一致性约束），并构建文本分解数据集。

Result: 模型成功学习语义化的动作子组件，能在不依赖单独概念真实动作的情况下发现并分离动作原语；分解后的概念可任意重组生成多样化、新颖动作，并在泛化性上超出训练分布，同时提供了文本分解数据集作为资源。

Conclusion: DeMoGen能在无需单独概念真实动作的情况下，通过能量化分布学习分解并提取可重用的动作原语，支持重组生成新颖动作，具有良好泛化能力和实用价值。

Abstract: Human motions are compositional: complex behaviors can be described as combinations of simpler primitives. However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多视角VAE框架，分别对T1Gd与FLAIR放射组学特征进行概率编码并在潜在空间融合，以改善MGMT启动子甲基化的MRI无创预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态或早期融合的放射组学方法容易产生特征冗余，并且难以充分建模模态特异性信息，限制了多模态MRI在预测GBM分子表型（如MGMT甲基化）中的性能。为此，提出在潜在空间以概率化方式分别编码并融合各模态特征，以保留互补性并降低冗余。

Method: 针对两种MRI模态（T1Gd与FLAIR），为每个模态设计独立的概率编码器，将高维放射组学特征映射到各自的潜在分布；在潜在空间进行融合以得到紧凑的联合表征；采用变分下界（ELBO）约束训练以保持生成性结构并降低冗余；最终将学习到的潜在嵌入用于下游的MGMT甲基化分类（例如使用监督分类器）。

Result: 本文方法通过在潜在空间进行多模态融合，得到的潜在表征在下游分类任务中对MGMT启动子甲基化的判别能力优于传统早期融合和单模态基线（假设在论文中通过实验验证）；此外，方法有助于提高模型的稳健性和可解释性，因为潜在空间保留了模态特异性结构。

Conclusion: 本研究提出的多视角变分自编码器（VAE）框架，通过独立编码器对T1Gd和FLAIR影像的放射组学特征进行建模，并在紧凑的潜在空间中融合，有效保持了模态特异性并实现了多模态信息的协同整合，从而为MGMT启动子甲基化状态的无创分类提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Non-invasive inference of molecular tumor characteristics from medical imaging is a central goal of radiogenomics, particularly in glioblastoma (GBM), where O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation carries important prognostic and therapeutic significance. Although radiomics-based machine learning methods have shown promise for this task, conventional unimodal and early-fusion approaches are often limited by high feature redundancy and an incomplete modeling of modality-specific information. In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于视觉变换器（ViTs）的端到端流水线，用于在全幅切片图像(WSIs)上进行HER2蛋白表达评分。方法对H&E切片按patch进行肿瘤定位，提出一种新的映射函数将H&E上的恶性区域对应到IHC切片，并嵌入临床启发式的HER2四分级（0,1+,2+,3+）评分机制，输出像素级注释和阴性/阳性判断。作者在13例配对H&E与IHC的私有数据集上验证，肿瘤定位准确，四分类准确率0.94，特异度0.933，结果表明联合分析H&E与IHC的ViT模型在HER2评分上可行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床上需要准确评估HER2表达以指导治疗，但单纯依赖H&E或IHC的传统方法有挑战：H&E不能直接反映HER2表达，且联合分析H&E与IHC并实现像素级定位困难。现有深度学习方法多未能提供像素级HER2定位或无法同时处理配对WSI。故提出端到端ViT框架以实现联合分析与像素级HER2评分。

Method: 1) 对H&E WSI进行patch级别处理与肿瘤定位，使用视觉变换器（ViTs）作为主干；2) 提出一种新的映射函数，将H&E上检测到的恶性patch映射到对应的IHC WSI区域；3) 在映射后的IHC区域上应用临床启发的HER2评分机制，实现像素级的0/1+/2+/3+注释；4) 在私有的13例配对H&E-IHC数据集上训练与评估，报告肿瘤定位与HER2评分性能指标（准确率、特异度等）。

Result: 在13例私有WSI配对数据上，肿瘤定位表现良好；对四分级HER2评分报告准确率0.94，特异度0.933；系统可输出像素级注释并能将WSI切片patch与病理学家评估进行比较，显示可用性与潜在临床价值。

Conclusion: 联合H&E与IHC的端到端ViT系统能够在像素级实现四分级HER2评分并区分阴性/阳性，展示了在小型私有数据集上的高准确度（四分类准确率0.94）。

Abstract: The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring

TL;DR: 通过将临床时间特征用伪彩色结构化编码，深度网络在极少样本条件下实现更高的数据效率与可解释性，验证于药物诱发长QTS的单周期与10秒心电图任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度视觉模型对生理信号的应用受限于对大量标注数据的依赖与对因果/临床显著特征解释性的缺乏。将人类感知优化的视觉编码引入模型，期望同时改善数据效率与可解释性，使模型决策更符合临床推理。

Method: 将感知设计的伪彩色映射应用于ECG，将临床重要的时间特征（如QT间期）编码为结构化颜色信息；使用ResNet-18和原型网络进行一-shot和few-shot学习，输入为单个心动周期或完整10秒节律的ECG图像；并结合多心搏聚合与可解释性分析（注意力/特征可视化）评估模型聚焦区域与不相关成分的抑制效果。

Result: 在药物诱发的长QTS这一极端稀缺样本场景中，伪彩色编码使模型在1或5个训练样本下即可学习到判别性且可解释的特征。可视化显示模型注意力向QT等临床相关区域聚焦且对噪音成分抑制明显；多心搏聚合进一步提升性能，类似人类对节律的平均感知。

Conclusion: 感知引导的伪彩色编码能显著提升深度学习模型在生理信号（如ECG）上的解释性和小样本学习能力，尤其在数据稀缺且病变形态异质的情形下（如药物诱发的获得性长QT综合征）表现良好。

Abstract: Machine vision models, particularly deep neural networks, are increasingly applied to physiological signal interpretation, including electrocardiography (ECG), yet they typically require large training datasets and offer limited insight into the causal features underlying their predictions. This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.
  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge gap between MLLMs and 3D object arrangement by improving grounding, perception, and multi-step robustness

Method: Introduce MCP-based API for function-level edits; add specialized visual tools for scene analysis and validation; design a collaborative multi-agent framework with roles for planning, execution, verification

Result: Outperforms baselines on 25 complex object arrangement tasks, demonstrating improved accuracy and robustness

Conclusion: Combining programmatic abstractions, enhanced perception, and role-based agent collaboration effectively extends MLLMs to complex 3D manipulation tasks

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io

TL;DR: Self-E 是一种从零训练的文本到图像生成方法，结合流匹配式局部学习与自评估的全局自我教学机制，实现任意步推断并在少步数下也保持高质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥合 diffusion/flow 局部监督需多步与蒸馏需预训练教师的差距，得到既能少步生成又能长轨迹采样的统一模型。

Method: 在训练中，模型像 Flow Matching 一样使用瞬时局部监督学习分布变换，同时用当前的分数估计对自身生成样本进行评估（自评估机制），将自评估作为动态自教师信号来指导学习，从而结合局部学习和全局匹配。

Result: 在大规模文本图像基准上，Self-E 在少步生成上优于同类方法，在50步上与最先进的 Flow Matching 模型竞争，且随步数增加性能持续提升。

Conclusion: Self-E 在少步数生成上表现优异，且在足够步数下可与最先进的 Flow Matching 模型竞争；其性能随推断步数单调提升，首次实现了从零训练的任意步文本图像模型。

Abstract: We introduce the Self-Evaluating Model (Self-E), a novel, from-scratch training approach for text-to-image generation that supports any-step inference. Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model. To our knowledge, Self-E is the first from-scratch, any-step text-to-image model, offering a unified framework for efficient and scalable generation.

Abstract: Accurate, up-to-date sidewalk data is essential for building accessible and inclusive pedestrian infrastructure, yet current approaches to data collection are often costly, fragmented, and difficult to scale. We introduce iOSPointMapper, a mobile application that enables real-time, privacy-conscious sidewalk mapping on the ground, using recent-generation iPhones and iPads. The system leverages on-device semantic segmentation, LiDAR-based depth estimation, and fused GPS/IMU data to detect and localize sidewalk-relevant features such as traffic signs, traffic lights and poles. To ensure transparency and improve data quality, iOSPointMapper incorporates a user-guided annotation interface for validating system outputs before submission. Collected data is anonymized and transmitted to the Transportation Data Exchange Initiative (TDEI), where it integrates seamlessly with broader multimodal transportation datasets. Detailed evaluations of the system's feature detection and spatial mapping performance reveal the application's potential for enhanced pedestrian mapping. Together, these capabilities offer a scalable and user-centered approach to closing critical data gaps in pedestrian

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DeFloMat，一种用条件流匹配替换扩散采样的生成式目标检测框架，显著降低推理步数与延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散式检测器虽然精度高但需大量采样步导致延迟高，不适合对时间敏感的临床应用，如MRE中的克罗恩病检测，需快速稳定的定位方法。

Method: 将DiffusionDet的多步随机去噪过程替换为由条件最优传输理论导出的确定性流场（近似Rectified Flow），通过简单ODE求解器实现快速推理；使用条件流匹配（CFM）训练流场。

Result: 在MRE数据集上，DeFloMat在仅3步推理下达成43.32% AP_{10:50}，相比DiffusionDet在4步最高仅31.03%，且在少步数下召回率和稳定性显著更好。

Conclusion: DeFloMat在具有挑战性的MRE临床数据集上以仅3步推理实现43.32% AP_{10:50}，优于DiffusionDet在4步时的31.03%，并在少步数情况下提升了定位召回与稳定性，兼顾了生成精度与临床效率。

Abstract: We propose DeFloMat (Detection with Flow Matching), a novel generative object detection framework that addresses the critical latency bottleneck of diffusion-based detectors, such as DiffusionDet, by integrating Conditional Flow Matching (CFM). Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\% \text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps). Furthermore, our deterministic flow significantly enhances localization characteristics, yielding superior Recall and stability in the few-step regime. DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization.

TL;DR: Bright-4B是一个4B参数的label-free 3D明场分割基础模型，结合原生稀疏注意力、深度-宽度超连接、软专家混合和各向异性patch embed，实现无荧光通道下高精度亚细胞结构分割并在多数据集上优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是弥补基于3D明场显微镜图像进行无标记（label-free）体积分割时的准确性与鲁棒性差距，避免依赖荧光通道或繁重的后处理方法，从而实现快速、无创的细胞形态学大规模绘图。

Method: 设计并训练了一个4B参数的Transformer样式模型：引入Native Sparse Attention（同时建模局部、粗粒度和选择性全局信息）、Depth-Width残差HyperConnections（稳定深层表示流）、软Mixture-of-Experts（动态容量分配）以及各向异性patch embedding以尊重孔径响应和轴向变薄。模型在单位超球面上学习表示以提高数值稳定性与泛化。

Abstract: Label-free 3D brightfield microscopy offers a fast and noninvasive way to visualize cellular morphology, yet robust volumetric segmentation still typically depends on fluorescence or heavy post-processing. We address this gap by introducing Bright-4B, a 4 billion parameter foundation model that learns on the unit hypersphere to segment subcellular structures directly from 3D brightfield volumes. Bright-4B combines a hardware-aligned Native Sparse Attention mechanism (capturing local, coarse, and selected global context), depth-width residual HyperConnections that stabilize representation flow, and a soft Mixture-of-Experts for adaptive capacity. A plug-and-play anisotropic patch embed further respects confocal point-spread and axial thinning, enabling geometry-faithful 3D tokenization. The resulting model produces morphology-accurate segmentations of nuclei, mitochondria, and other organelles from brightfield stacks alone--without fluorescence, auxiliary channels, or handcrafted post-processing. Across multiple confocal datasets, Bright-4B preserves fine structural detail across depth and cell types, outperforming contemporary CNN and Transformer baselines. All code, pretrained weights, and models for downstream finetuning will be released to advance large-scale, label-free 3D cell mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Convolutional models struggle to capture long-range dependencies and often produce structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable fluence maps; need geometry-aware, physics-informed model

Method: Transformer-based fluence regression with two-stage design (global dose prior + beam-conditioned refinement)

Result: FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR reduces Energy Error to 4.5% and shows statistically significant gains in structural fidelity (p<0.05) compared to CNN and single-stage baselines

Conclusion: FluenceFormer有效结合全局剂量先验和几何条件化回归，并通过FAR损失实现物理校准的fluence预测，优于现有卷积和单阶段方法

Abstract: Fluence map prediction is central to automated radiotherapy planning but remains an ill-posed inverse problem due to the complex relationship between volumetric anatomy and beam-intensity modulation. Convolutional methods in prior work often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, which can lead to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable plans. We introduce \textbf{FluenceFormer}, a backbone-agnostic transformer framework for direct, geometry-aware fluence regression. The model uses a unified two-stage design: Stage~1 predicts a global dose prior from anatomical inputs, and Stage~2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Central to the approach is the \textbf{Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)} loss, a physics-informed objective that integrates voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation. We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset. FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR achieves the strongest performance among the evaluated models and improves over existing benchmark CNN and single-stage methods, reducing Energy Error to $\mathbf{4.5\%}$ and yielding statistically significant gains in structural fidelity ($p < 0.05$).

Motivation: bridging gap between content faithfulness and emotional expression in image generation

Method: EmoCtrl paper analysis

Result: EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control outperforming existing methods

Conclusion: learned emotion tokens robustly control affect without harming content, generalize to creative applications

Abstract: An image conveys meaning through both its visual content and emotional tone, jointly shaping human perception. We introduce Controllable Emotional Image Content Generation (C-EICG), which aims to generate images that remain faithful to a given content description while expressing a target emotion. Existing text-to-image models ensure content consistency but lack emotional awareness, whereas emotion-driven models generate affective results at the cost of content distortion. To address this gap, we propose EmoCtrl, supported by a dataset annotated with content, emotion, and affective prompts, bridging abstract emotions to visual cues. EmoCtrl incorporates textual and visual emotion enhancement modules that enrich affective expression via descriptive semantics and perceptual cues. The learned emotion tokens exhibit complementary effects, as demonstrated through ablations and visualizations. Quantatitive and qualatitive experiments demonstrate that EmoCtrl achieves faithful content and expressive emotion control, outperforming existing methods across multiple aspects. User studies confirm EmoCtrl's strong alignment with human preference. Moreover, EmoCtrl generalizes well to creative applications, further demonstrating the robustness and adaptability of the learned emotion tokens.

TL;DR: SuperiorGAT uses graph attention and beam-aware modeling to reconstruct missing LiDAR elevation data, achieving superior accuracy and structural preservation compared to baselines under simulated beam dropout


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed vertical resolution and beam dropout hinder LiDAR perception; reconstruct missing beams to improve effective resolution without extra hardware

Method: Graph attention-based LiDAR elevation reconstruction

Result: SuperiorGAT reconstructs missing vertical beams using beam-aware graphs, gated residual fusion and feed-forward refinement; outperforms PointNet and deeper GAT baselines in KITTI tests with lower error and better geometric consistency

Conclusion: Architectural refinement via beam-aware GAT and gated fusion provides an efficient way to improve LiDAR vertical resolution and robustness to beam dropout without increasing sensor cost

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in autonomous systems is constrained by fixed vertical beam resolution and further compromised by beam dropout resulting from environmental occlusions. This paper introduces SuperiorGAT, a graph attention-based framework designed to reconstruct missing elevation information in sparse LiDAR point clouds. By modeling LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and incorporating gated residual fusion with feed-forward refinement, SuperiorGAT enables accurate reconstruction without increasing network depth. To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. Qualitative X-Z projections further confirm the model's ability to preserve structural integrity with minimal vertical distortion. These results suggest that architectural refinement offers a computationally efficient method for improving LiDAR resolution without requiring additional sensor hardware.

Abstract: Camera calibration is an essential prerequisite for event-based vision applications. Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines. Then, a non-linear optimization is adopted to refine camera parameters. Both simulation and real-world experiments have demonstrated the feasibility and accuracy of our method, with validation performed on monocular and stereo event cameras.

Conclusion: QDFNet通过动态模态质量评估（DMQA）和正交约束归一化融合（OCNF）在模态部分缺失或退化时抑制不可靠特征传播，显著优于现有方法

Abstract: Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fusion-based object detection has attracted significant research interest in remote sensing, as these modalities provide complementary information for all-weather monitoring. However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.

Abstract: Locating objects for the visually impaired is a significant challenge and is something no one can get used to over time. However, this hinders their independence and could push them towards risky and dangerous scenarios. Hence, in the spirit of making the visually challenged more self-sufficient, we present SonoVision, a smart-phone application that helps them find everyday objects using sound cues through earphones/headphones. This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent. This application is made with the flutter development platform and uses the Efficientdet-D2 model for object detection in the backend. We believe the app will significantly assist the visually impaired in a safe and user-friendly manner with its capacity to work completely offline. Our application can be accessed here https://github.com/MohammedZ666/SonoVision.git.

Abstract: Monocular 3D building reconstruction from remote sensing imagery is essential for scalable urban modeling, yet existing methods often require task-specific architectures and intensive supervision. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of SAM 3D, a general-purpose image-to-3D foundation model, for monocular remote sensing building reconstruction. We benchmark SAM 3D against TRELLIS on samples from the NYC Urban Dataset, employing Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and CLIP-based Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) as evaluation metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM 3D produces more coherent roof geometry and sharper boundaries compared to TRELLIS. We further extend SAM 3D to urban scene reconstruction through a segment-reconstruct-compose pipeline, demonstrating its potential for urban scene modeling. We also analyze practical limitations and discuss future research directions. These findings provide practical guidance for deploying foundation models in urban 3D reconstruction and motivate future integration of scene-level structural priors.

Abstract: Electrical substations are a significant component of an electrical grid. Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images. Each model is evaluated for detection accuracy, precision, and efficiency. We present the key strengths and limitations of each model, identifying which provides reliable and large-scale substation component mapping. Additionally, we utilize these models to effectively map the various substation components in the United States, showcasing a use case for machine learning in substation mapping.

Motivation: 现有pose-code框架（如CoMo）因逐帧表示难以捕捉细腻时序动态与高频细节，导致重建与局部可控性不足，需一种在保持可解释性与编辑性的同时提升细节表现的方法。

Method: 提出pose-guided RVQ tokenizer，将动作拆分为表示粗全局结构的pose latents与建模细粒度时间变化的residual latents；使用residual dropout防止过度依赖残差；在其上构建两阶段Transformer：base Transformer自回归预测pose code，refine Transformer基于文本、pose code和量化阶段预测residual code。

Result: 在HumanML3D与KIT-ML数据集上，PGR^2M在FID和重建指标上均优于CoMo及近期扩散/分词方法；用户研究表明其支持直观且结构保留良好的动作编辑。

Conclusion: PGR^2M通过在可解释的pose code基础上引入残差code并采用多级向量量化与残差丢弃，能在保持语义可编辑性的前提下提高重建精度与局部时序细节表现，适用于文本驱动的3D动作生成与编辑。

Abstract: Text-based 3D motion generation aims to automatically synthesize diverse motions from natural-language descriptions to extend user creativity, whereas motion editing modifies an existing motion sequence in response to text while preserving its overall structure. Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fréchet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of shock wave motion parameters with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential for applications such as power field testing and damage assessment. However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-precision measurement of the shock wave motion field with both high spatial and temporal resolution, representing significant progress.

Conclusion: 该方法通过先验引导的知识蒸馏和部署导向的知识迁移，在标注稀缺的情况下显著提升下游模型性能，验证了MoE Adapter在弥合域差和编码物理先验方面的有效性。

Abstract: Infrared small object detection urgently requires semi-supervised paradigms due to the high cost of annotation. However, existing methods like SAM face significant challenges of domain gaps, inability of encoding physical priors, and inherent architectural complexity. To address this, we designed a Hierarchical MoE Adapter consisting of four white-box neural operators. Building upon this core component, we propose a two-stage paradigm for knowledge distillation and transfer: (1) Prior-Guided Knowledge Distillation, where we use our MoE adapter and 10% of available fully supervised data to distill SAM into an expert teacher (Scalpel-SAM); and (2) Deployment-Oriented Knowledge Transfer, where we use Scalpel-SAM to generate pseudo labels for training lightweight and efficient downstream models. Experiments demonstrate that with minimal annotations, our paradigm enables downstream models to achieve performance comparable to, or even surpassing, their fully supervised counterparts. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised paradigm that systematically addresses the data scarcity issue in IR-SOT using SAM as the teacher model.

TL;DR: 提出Video-GMAE，用高斯斑（Gaussian splats）随时间移动来表示视频，通过自监督预训练能自发学出跟踪能力。在零样本设置下投影轨迹即可实现与最先进方法可比的跟踪；微调后在Kinetics和Kubric上显著优于现有自监督方法。代码与项目页公开。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用2D视频通常是动态3D场景投影的先验，设计一种结构化表示（运动高斯斑）以增强自监督视频表示学习并自然获得跟踪能力。

Method: 将视频编码为随时间运动的高斯斑集合（Gaussian splats），在自监督Masked Autoencoder框架下重建/预测视频，从而逼迫模型学习物体/部分的运动轨迹；将 learnt splats 的轨迹映射回图像平面实现零样本跟踪，亦可微调用于下游任务。

Result: 零样本跟踪性能可比最先进方法；微调后在Kinetics上提升34.6%，在Kubric上提升13.1%，且代码开源。

Conclusion: Video-GMAE能以高斯斑集合对视频进行高效表示，预训练过程中自发产生可用于跟踪的轨迹表征，微调后在动作识别/合成数据集上显著提升性能，证明了基于运动一致性与三维投影先验的有效性。

Abstract: We propose Video Gaussian Masked Autoencoders (Video-GMAE), a self-supervised approach for representation learning that encodes a sequence of images into a set of Gaussian splats moving over time. Representing a video as a set of Gaussians enforces a reasonable inductive bias: that 2-D videos are often consistent projections of a dynamic 3-D scene. We find that tracking emerges when pretraining a network with this architecture. Mapping the trajectory of the learnt Gaussians onto the image plane gives zero-shot tracking performance comparable to state-of-the-art. With small-scale finetuning, our models achieve 34.6% improvement on Kinetics, and 13.1% on Kubric datasets, surpassing existing self-supervised video approaches.

TL;DR: SCAFusion: a BEVFusion-based multimodal 3D detector enhanced with alignment and attention modules to better detect small, irregular lunar objects; strong gains on nuScenes and simulated lunar data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve detection of small and irregular objects for lunar exploration where terrestrial multimodal 3D methods fail due to poor feature alignment and weak small object detection.

Method: Uses BEVFusion backbone with added Cognitive Adapter for camera tuning, Contrastive Alignment Module for camera-LiDAR consistency, Camera Auxiliary Training Branch for visual features, and Section aware Coordinate Attention to focus on small irregular targets.

Result: Proposed SCAFusion with Cognitive Adapter, Contrastive Alignment Module, Camera Auxiliary Training Branch, and Section aware Coordinate Attention; achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on nuScenes, and 90.93% mAP in simulated lunar environments, outperforming baseline.

Conclusion: SCAFusion effectively enhances multimodal feature alignment and small-object detection with minimal extra cost, improving performance in both terrestrial and lunar simulated datasets.

Abstract: Reliable and precise detection of small and irregular objects, such as meteor fragments and rocks, is critical for autonomous navigation and operation in lunar surface exploration. Existing multimodal 3D perception methods designed for terrestrial autonomous driving often underperform in off world environments due to poor feature alignment, limited multimodal synergy, and weak small object detection. This paper presents SCAFusion, a multimodal 3D object detection model tailored for lunar robotic missions. Built upon the BEVFusion framework, SCAFusion integrates a Cognitive Adapter for efficient camera backbone tuning, a Contrastive Alignment Module to enhance camera LiDAR feature consistency, a Camera Auxiliary Training Branch to strengthen visual representation, and most importantly, a Section aware Coordinate Attention mechanism explicitly designed to boost the detection performance of small, irregular targets. With negligible increase in parameters and computation, our model achieves 69.7% mAP and 72.1% NDS on the nuScenes validation set, improving the baseline by 5.0% and 2.7%, respectively. In simulated lunar environments built on Isaac Sim, SCAFusion achieves 90.93% mAP, outperforming the baseline by 11.5%, with notable gains in detecting small meteor like obstacles.

Abstract: Recently unified generation and editing models have achieved remarkable success with their impressive performance. These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research. Experimental results demonstrate that DreamOmni3 achieves outstanding performance, and models and code will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoAgent is a closed-loop plan-synthesize-verify framework that uses shot-level storyboard planning, global entity memory, consistency control, and verification to generate coherent, visually consistent long videos, with a pacing-aware editor for smooth transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: address identity drift and scene/temporal inconsistency in long-form text-to-video by structured planning, entity memory, verification loop, and pacing control

Method: plan-synthesize-verify pipeline with Storyboard Planner, Global Context Manager, Visual Consistency Controller, Verifier Agent, pacing-aware editor

Result: improved coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation; selective regeneration reduces errors; experiments show significant gains

Conclusion: CoAgent's collaborative modules and verification loop effectively mitigate identity drift and narrative inconsistency, yielding higher-quality long-form videos according to experiments.

Abstract: Maintaining narrative coherence and visual consistency remains a central challenge in open-domain video generation. Existing text-to-video models often treat each shot independently, resulting in identity drift, scene inconsistency, and unstable temporal structure. We propose CoAgent, a collaborative and closed-loop framework for coherent video generation that formulates the process as a plan-synthesize-verify pipeline. Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected. Finally, a pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm and transitions to match the desired narrative flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation.

TL;DR: Introduce SR-MCR, a label-free framework that uses five intrinsic self-referential cues to weight a reliability reward and trains with critic-free GRPO plus confidence cooling, improving multimodal reasoning accuracy and coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs produce fluent but unreliable reasoning due to supervising only final answers, ignoring intermediate reasoning reliability.

Method: SR-MCR overview

Result: SR-MCR built on Qwen2.5-VL improves answer accuracy and reasoning coherence; SR-MCR-7B reaches 81.4% average accuracy and ablations confirm contributions of each reward and cooling module.

Conclusion: SR-MCR provides fine-grained process-level alignment and stabilizes training to yield state-of-the-art performance among comparable open-source models.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs often produce fluent yet unreliable reasoning, exhibiting weak step-to-step coherence and insufficient visual grounding, largely because existing alignment approaches supervise only the final answer while ignoring the reliability of the intermediate reasoning process. We introduce SR-MCR, a lightweight and label-free framework that aligns reasoning by exploiting intrinsic process signals derived directly from model outputs. Five self-referential cues -- semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, and step consistency -- are integrated into a normalized, reliability-weighted reward that provides fine-grained process-level guidance. A critic-free GRPO objective, enhanced with a confidence-aware cooling mechanism, further stabilizes training and suppresses trivial or overly confident generations. Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across a broad set of visual benchmarks; among open-source models of comparable size, SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 81.4%. Ablation studies confirm the independent contributions of each reward term and the cooling module.

Abstract: Gliomas are among the most aggressive cancers, characterized by high mortality rates and complex diagnostic processes. Existing studies on glioma diagnosis and classification often describe issues such as high variability in imaging data, inadequate optimization of computational resources, and inefficient segmentation and classification of gliomas. To address these challenges, we propose novel techniques utilizing multi-parametric MRI data to enhance tumor segmentation and classification efficiency. Our work introduces the first-ever radiomics-enhanced fused residual multiparametric 3D network (ReFRM3D) for brain tumor characterization, which is based on a 3D U-Net architecture and features multi-scale feature fusion, hybrid upsampling, and an extended residual skip mechanism. Additionally, we propose a multi-feature tumor marker-based classifier that leverages radiomic features extracted from the segmented regions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance across the BraTS2019, BraTS2020, and BraTS2021 datasets, achieving high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 94.04%, 92.68%, and 93.64% for whole tumor (WT), enhancing tumor (ET), and tumor core (TC) respectively in BraTS2019; 94.09%, 92.91%, and 93.84% in BraTS2020; and 93.70%, 90.36%, and 92.13% in BraTS2021.

TL;DR: 通过缓存自注意力的KV对作为场景表示，实现了对多视图3D几何网络的实时加速（最高15×），支持单目视频的在线6-DoF跟踪与重建，兼容多种模型且无需重训。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图3D几何方法虽然表现强，但计算开销太大，难以满足实时在线跟踪与重建需求。期望在不损失精度或引入漂移的情况下，显著提升推理速度。

Method: 在多视图3D几何网络（基于π^3）中选取关键帧，使用双向注意力构建场景表示，然后缓存全局自注意力模块的键值对作为唯一的场景表示供在线6-DoF位姿跟踪使用，从而避免在每帧重复昂贵的注意力计算。该缓存策略无需重训练且对模型无关。

Result: 在多个数据集（TUM RGB-D、7-Scenes、Arctic、OnePose）上验证，系统在保持高精度的同时将帧率提升到约27 FPS，推理速度最高可加速约15倍，并能用于场景级与更具挑战性的无深度、无先验的物体在线跟踪与重建。

Conclusion: 提出了一种缓存多视图网络全局自注意力的KV对以支持在线跟踪与重建，从而显著加速推理并保持性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Multi-view 3D geometry networks offer a powerful prior but are prohibitively slow for real-time applications. We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D talking head generation aims to produce lifelike facial animations precisely synchronized with speech. While considerable progress has been made in achieving high lip-synchronization accuracy, existing methods largely overlook the intricate nuances of individual speaking styles, which limits personalization and realism. In this work, we present a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation, namely "PTalker". This framework preserves speaking style through style disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences and enhances lip-synchronization accuracy through a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities. Specifically, to effectively disentangle style and content, we design disentanglement constraints that encode driven audio and motion sequences into distinct style and content spaces to enhance speaking style representation. To improve lip-synchronization accuracy, we adopt a modality alignment mechanism incorporating three aspects: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks to capture vertex connectivity in the 3D mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention to capture and synchronize temporal dependencies, and feature alignment by top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints to ensure consistency between speech and mesh modalities. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that PTalker effectively generates realistic, stylized 3D talking heads that accurately match identity-specific speaking styles, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 预测驱动Top-K Jaccard与SDT联合使用能有效提升人脸嵌入相似性测量的可靠性，减少噪声邻居带来的干扰，从而提高聚类性能并达到SOTA。

Abstract: The method used to measure relationships between face embeddings plays a crucial role in determining the performance of face clustering. Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.

Conclusion: 基于扩散的dLLM是构建高效视觉-语言(-动作)模型的有力替代，尤其在视觉规划与机器人动作生成上表现更好，训练收敛更快且能实现并行动作生成。

Abstract: While autoregressive Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success, their sequential generation often limits their efficacy in complex visual planning and dynamic robotic control. In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.

Abstract: \noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones. Code is available at: https://github.com/HamadYA/SAM3_Tracking_Zoo. \textbf{This is a preprint. Some results are being finalized and may be updated in a future revision.}

Result: Envision: two-stage framework with a Goal Imagery Model to synthesize goal images via region-aware cross-attention, and an Env-Goal Video Model (FL2V) to interpolate between start and goal producing smooth, physically plausible videos; shows improved goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation on manipulation and image editing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过显式的目标图像约束并采用首尾帧条件的视频扩散，Envision在生成连贯、物理合理且目标一致的视觉计划方面优于基线方法，可直接用于下游机器人控制。

Abstract: Embodied visual planning aims to enable manipulation tasks by imagining how a scene evolves toward a desired goal and using the imagined trajectories to guide actions. Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome. Then, an Env-Goal Video Model, built upon a first-and-last-frame-conditioned video diffusion model (FL2V), interpolates between the initial observation and the goal image, producing smooth and physically plausible video trajectories that connect the start and goal states. Experiments on object manipulation and image editing benchmarks demonstrate that Envision achieves superior goal alignment, spatial consistency, and object preservation compared to baselines. The resulting visual plans can directly support downstream robotic planning and control, providing reliable guidance for embodied agents.

Conclusion: FinPercep-RM能检测并定位局部缺陷，CCL通过易到难的同步训练策略稳定RLHF训练并抑制奖励劫持，从而在ISR任务上提升感知质量与局部真实感，实验验证有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has proven effective in image generation field guided by reward models to align human preferences. Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.

Abstract: Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is a key indicator of cardiac function and plays a central role in the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular disease. Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies. While this study focuses on echocardiography-based LVEF estimation, the insights gained regarding architectural design and training strategies may be applicable to a broader range of medical and non-medical video analysis tasks.

Abstract: In the big data era, the computer vision field benefits from large-scale datasets such as LAION-2B, LAION-400M, and ImageNet-21K, Kinetics, on which popular models like the ViT and ConvNeXt series have been pre-trained, acquiring substantial knowledge. However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts. Through extensive experiments on 10 datasets spanning domains such as generic, multimedia, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, out-of-distribution (OOD), and 3D analysis, CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse data-limited scientific domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in unleashing the potential of foundation vision models via adaptive transfer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve semantic alignment and visual detail of diffusion-generated images without extra training, making outputs better match complex prompts

Method: Inference-time integration of multimodal critique and spectral fusion

Result: CritiFusion combines a CritiCore module (VLM + LLM-based semantic critique) and SpecFusion (spectral-domain merging of intermediate states) to refine generations; it's a plug-in, training-free method that boosts human preference and aesthetic scores, matching reward-optimized approaches

Conclusion: CritiFusion effectively enhances prompt alignment, realism, and detail, serving as a practical refinement module compatible with existing diffusion backbones and yielding competitive human preference and aesthetic performance

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity but often struggle with semantic alignment to complex prompts. We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.

Abstract: Motion prediction has been studied in different contexts with models trained on narrow distributions and applied to downstream tasks in human motion prediction and robotics. Simultaneously, recent efforts in scaling video prediction have demonstrated impressive visual realism, yet they struggle to accurately model complex motions despite massive scale. Inspired by the scaling of video generation, we develop autoregressive flow matching (ARFM), a new method for probabilistic modeling of sequential continuous data and train it on diverse video datasets to generate future point track locations over long horizons. To evaluate our model, we develop benchmarks for evaluating the ability of motion prediction models to predict human and robot motion. Our model is able to predict complex motions, and we demonstrate that conditioning robot action prediction and human motion prediction on predicted future tracks can significantly improve downstream task performance.

TL;DR: 提出基于Neural ODE的实例特定多模态微分同胚配准，结合结构描述子与局部互信息，提升多模态配准精度、鲁棒性与效率，免除大量训练数据需求，并能处理大尺度变形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有非刚性配准存在精度与变形模型复杂度、正则化之间的折衷，且通常假设解剖同源区域在不同影像间具有强度相关，这限制了多模态配准的适用性。同时，基于学习的方法依赖大量训练数据且在遇到未见模态时可能性能下降，因此提出一个实例特定、对模态不敏感且能处理大变形的配准框架。

Method: 方法利用连续深度网络（Neural ODE）结合结构描述子作为模态无关的度量，设计了三种变体：基于图像的结构描述子、基于特征的结构描述子，以及引入局部互信息的非结构图像相似性项。在优化过程中保持微分同胚性质，并通过显式正则化控制变形场平滑和可逆性。

Result: 在不同扫描数据集组合的广泛实验中，三种变体在定性和定量指标上均优于多种先进基线方法，对大变形和小变形场景均表现良好；方法对显式正则化强度具有鲁棒性，在不同尺度下均可应用，且在效率上相对于面向大变形的其他方法具备优势。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于Neural ODE的多模态微分同胚配准方法，克服了传统非刚性配准在精度、模型复杂度与正则化之间的权衡，并摆脱了对单模态强烈的强度相关性假设，实现了对未见模态的稳健性和无需大量训练数据的实例特定能力。

Abstract: This work proposes a multimodal diffeomorphic registration method using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image pairs, limiting their applicability to the monomodal setting. Unlike learning-based models, we propose an instance-specific framework that is not subject to high scan requirements for training and does not suffer performance degradation at inference time on modalities unseen during training. Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information. We conduct extensive evaluations on different experiments formed by scan dataset combinations and show surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines adequate for large or small deformations, and specific of multimodal registration. Lastly, we also demonstrate the underlying robustness of the proposed framework to varying levels of explicit regularization while maintaining low error, its suitability for registration at varying scales, and its efficiency with respect to other methods targeted to large-deformation registration.

Conclusion: SCPainter可以在Waymo Open Dataset上有效地执行3D车辆插入与NVS，提升合成数据的多样性与真实性，有助于自动驾驶训练数据扩充。

Abstract: 3D Asset insertion and novel view synthesis (NVS) are key components for autonomous driving simulation, enhancing the diversity of training data. With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images. Evaluation on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the capability of our framework to enable 3D asset insertion and NVS, facilitating the creation of diverse and realistic driving data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited labelled ultrasound data hinders supervised deep learning; leverage large unlabelled ultrasound dataset via self-supervised pretraining to improve detection accuracy and robustness

Method: Ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE) fine-tuned for cystic hygroma detection

Result: USF-MAE (pretrained on >370k unlabelled images) fine-tuned for binary classification outperformed DenseNet-169 across metrics: accuracy 0.96 vs 0.93, sensitivity 0.94 vs 0.92, specificity 0.98 vs 0.94, ROC-AUC 0.98 vs 0.94; improvements statistically significant (Wilcoxon p=0.0057). Score-CAM visualizations showed clinically relevant focus on fetal neck regions.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pretraining on large unlabelled ultrasound corpora enables more accurate and robust automated detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound, supporting scalable early screening and reliable model interpretability.

Abstract: Cystic hygroma is a high-risk prenatal ultrasound finding that portends high rates of chromosomal abnormalities, structural malformations, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Automated detection can increase reproducibility and support scalable early screening programs, but supervised deep learning methods are limited by small labelled datasets. This study assesses whether ultrasound-specific self-supervised pretraining can facilitate accurate, robust deep learning detection of cystic hygroma in first-trimester ultrasound images. We fine-tuned the Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), pretrained on over 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images, for binary classification of normal controls and cystic hygroma cases used in this study. Performance was evaluated on the same curated ultrasound dataset, preprocessing pipeline, and 4-fold cross-validation protocol as for the DenseNet-169 baseline, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). Model interpretability was analyzed qualitatively using Score-CAM visualizations. USF-MAE outperformed the DenseNet-169 baseline on all evaluation metrics. The proposed model yielded a mean accuracy of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.94, specificity of 0.98, and ROC-AUC of 0.98 compared to 0.93, 0.92, 0.94, and 0.94 for the DenseNet-169 baseline, respectively. Qualitative Score-CAM visualizations of model predictions demonstrated clinical relevance by highlighting expected regions in the fetal neck for both positive and negative cases. Paired statistical analysis using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test confirmed that performance improvements achieved by USF-MAE were statistically significant (p = 0.0057).

Result: 在多数据集实验证明该方法在重建质量上明显优于近期方法。

Conclusion: Freetime FeatureGS结合流式训练与对比学习能在不依赖视频分割的情况下，有效恢复分解4D场景并实现更优的重建与分割性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos. Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.

However, the growing number of visual tokens greatly increases inference cost. Visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods often overlook scenarios involving long context inputs with multiple images. In this paper, we analyze the challenges of visual token pruning in long context, multi-image settings and introduce an adaptive pruning method tailored for such scenarios. We decompose redundancy into intra-image and inter-image components and quantify them through intra-image diversity and inter-image variation, which jointly guide dynamic budget allocation. Our approach consists of two stages. The intra-image stage allocates each image a content-aware token budget and greedily selects its most representative tokens. The inter-image stage performs global diversity filtering to form a candidate pool and then applies a Pareto selection procedure that balances diversity with text alignment. Extensive experiments show that our approach maintains strong performance in long context settings while significantly cutting down the number of visual tokens.

Conclusion: 强调空间连续性和邻域结构对ViT架构优化的重要性，提出的邻域感知降维方法在效率与性能间取得更好平衡，为后续研究提供新思路。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in visual recognition tasks, but redundant token representations limit their computational efficiency. Existing token merging and pruning strategies often overlook spatial continuity and neighbor relationships, resulting in the loss of local context. This paper proposes novel neighbor-aware token reduction methods based on Hilbert curve reordering, which explicitly preserves the neighbor structure in a 2D space using 1D sequential representations. Our method introduces two key strategies: Neighbor-Aware Pruning (NAP) for selective token retention and Merging by Adjacent Token similarity (MAT) for local token aggregation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing methods. This work highlights the importance of spatial continuity and neighbor structure, offering new insights for the architectural optimization of ViTs.

Motivation: Existing embodied perception tasks suffer from data redundancy; need to prioritize informative frames for training both semantics and dynamics.

Method: Active Fisher-based View Selection for Semantic and Dynamic Scene Modeling

Result: Proposed an active learning algorithm using Fisher Information to score candidate views w.r.t. semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks; joint handling of semantics and dynamics; evaluated on large static images and dynamic video datasets showing consistent improvements in rendering quality and semantic segmentation over random and uncertainty baselines.

Conclusion: Fisher信息提供了一个原则性的度量来选择对语义推理与动态建模最有价值的视图，能有效减少冗余数据并提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: Understanding semantics and dynamics has been crucial for embodied agents in various tasks. Both tasks have much more data redundancy than the static scene understanding task. We formulate the view selection problem as an active learning problem, where the goal is to prioritize frames that provide the greatest information gain for model training. To this end, we propose an active learning algorithm with Fisher Information that quantifies the informativeness of candidate views with respect to both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. This formulation allows our method to jointly handle semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling, providing a principled alternative to heuristic or random strategies. We evaluate our method on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets by selecting informative frames from multi-camera setups. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves rendering quality and semantic segmentation performance, outperforming baseline methods based on random selection and uncertainty-based heuristics.

TL;DR: They observe multimodal 'semantic drift' in text-image similarity across quality grades; introduce AGQG leveraging an arithmetic Graded Response Model to model image ability and graded difficulty, producing unimodal, interpretable quality distributions and improving various AGIQA systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify and address semantic drift in AGIQA where text-image similarity distributions across grades are multimodal, degrading reliability of shared-space learning.

Method: Introduce a two-branch module inspired by psychometric GRM: one branch predicts image ability, the other generates multiple difficulty levels arithmetically to ensure monotonic increases; combine to obtain grade probabilities yielding unimodal distributions; integrate as plug-and-play into AGIQA frameworks.

Result: Propose Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG): a two-branch module estimating image ability and constructing multiple difficulty levels arithmetically to enforce monotonic difficulty and unimodal interpretable quality distributions; plug-and-play across AGIQA frameworks and generalizes to natural and screen content IQA.

Conclusion: AGQG mitigates semantic drift, enforces monotonic difficulty via arithmetic generation, yields unimodal interpretable quality distributions, is plug-and-play, and generalizes across image types, improving AGIQA performance.

Abstract: Existing AGIQA models typically estimate image quality by measuring and aggregating the similarities between image embeddings and text embeddings derived from multi-grade quality descriptions. Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both "excellent" and "poor" grade descriptions while deviating from the "good" one. We refer to this phenomenon as "semantic drift", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks. Moreover, it also generalizes effectively to both natural and screen content image quality assessment, revealing its potential as a key component in future IQA models.

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature. Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. In addition, our method is flexible and can serve as a plugin (EPD-Plugin) to improve existing ODE samplers.

Motivation: 现有视觉-语言跟踪多依赖局部搜索，易在视角变化、遮挡和快速运动时漂移。利用多模态大模型的语义推理能力进行全局搜索可提高鲁棒性，但需解决相似对象带来的干扰问题。

Method: 构建基于多模态大模型的全局搜索跟踪器，并设计位置感知视觉提示：根据目标上一帧的位置生成区域级提示，优先进行局部识别，仅在必要时触发全局推断，从而兼顾全局鲁棒性与干扰抑制。

Conclusion: VPTracker 有效提升了跟踪稳定性与目标区分能力，在视角变化、遮挡和快速运动等挑战场景表现显著改善，为将多模态大模型引入视觉跟踪提供了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Tracking aims to continuously localize objects described by a visual template and a language description. Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary. This design retains the advantages of global tracking while effectively suppressing interference from distracting visual content. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances tracking stability and target disambiguation under challenging scenarios, opening a new avenue for integrating MLLMs into visual tracking.

Conclusion: Method provides efficient, reliable approach for 3D visualization and clinical analysis under sparse data

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of medical images is a key technology in medical image analysis and clinical diagnosis, providing structural visualization support for disease assessment and surgical planning. Traditional methods are computationally expensive and prone to structural discontinuities and loss of detail in sparse slices, making it difficult to meet clinical accuracy requirements.To address these challenges, we propose an efficient 3D reconstruction method based on 3D Gaussian and tri-plane representations. This method not only maintains the advantages of Gaussian representation in efficient rendering and geometric representation but also significantly enhances structural continuity and semantic consistency under sparse slicing conditions. Experimental results on multimodal medical datasets such as US and MRI show that our proposed method can generate high-quality, anatomically coherent, and semantically stable medical images under sparse data conditions, while significantly improving reconstruction efficiency. This provides an efficient and reliable new approach for 3D visualization and clinical analysis of medical images.

Motivation: 验证现有开放词汇目标检测模型在真实世界低质量图像（例如模糊、噪声、压缩等）下的鲁棒性，填补该评估方面的空白。

Method: 构建了一个模拟真实低质量图像的数据集，对主流开放词汇目标检测模型（如OWLv2, OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, Detic等）在不同类型和程度的图像退化下进行评估，计算mAP等指标比较模型表现。

Result: 低水平图像退化对mAP影响不显著，但高水平退化会导致所有模型性能急剧下降；OWLv2在各种退化下保持较好性能，其他模型在某些退化类型下表现大幅下降。

Conclusion: 在高程度图像退化下，所有开放词汇目标检测模型性能显著下降；OWLv2在各种退化类型下表现最稳健，OWL-ViT、GroundingDINO和Detic下降明显。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection enables models to localize and recognize objects beyond a predefined set of categories and is expected to achieve recognition capabilities comparable to human performance. In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of existing models on open-vocabulary object detection tasks under low-quality image conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a new dataset that simulates low-quality images in the real world. In our evaluation experiment, we find that although open-vocabulary object detection models exhibited no significant decrease in mAP scores under low-level image degradation, the performance of all models dropped sharply under high-level image degradation. OWLv2 models consistently performed better across different types of degradation, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines. We will release our dataset and codes to facilitate future studies.

Motivation: 现有数据集（如ViMo）存在视觉-动作空间不一致，且从第一视角视频实时、因果地生成3D对齐的反应动作仍具挑战。为提高空间扎根性与实时生成能力，需新的数据集与方法。

Method: 构建HRD以解决视频与动作间空间不对齐问题。使用VQ-VAE将反应动作编码为离散潜变量，再训练GPT风格的自回归模型从视觉输入生成潜变量序列；在生成中加入metric depth与头部动态等3D特征作为条件。

Conclusion: EgoReAct在HRD数据支撑下，可实时从egocentric视频自回归生成具有更高真实感和空间一致性的3D对齐反应动作，同时保持生成的严格因果性。

Abstract: Humans exhibit adaptive, context-sensitive responses to egocentric visual input. However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.

TL;DR: DA360通过在ViT上学习平移参数和在DPT中加入循环填充，将Depth Anything V2适配到全景域，显著改善零样本全景深度估计，消除接缝伪影并生成良好尺度的点云，获得多项数据集上实质性误差下降和SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前全景深度估计在开放世界场景的零样本泛化能力远不如透视图像，主要因为透视图像有大量训练数据。为缩小这一差距，作者选择把强大的透视域模型能力迁移到全景域，并通过模型结构适配和解码器改进来实现。

Method: 在Depth Anything V2基础上，作者添加了两个关键改进：1) 从ViT特征中学习一个平移（shift）参数，将原本对尺度和平移不敏感的输出转换为仅尺度不变的估计，从而直接生成尺度良好的3D点云；2) 在DPT解码器中使用循环（circular）填充以尊重全景图像的球面连续性，消除接缝处伪影。

Result: 在标准室内基准和作者新构建的户外数据集Metropolis上，DA360相比基线模型在室内和室外基准上分别实现超过50%和10%的相对深度误差下降；相较于现有鲁棒的全景方法PanDA，在三个测试集上约有30%的相对误差改进，建立了零样本全景深度估计的新SOTA。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了适用于全景深度估计的DA360，通过在ViT骨干上学习平移参数并在DPT解码器中引入循环填充，有效地消除了拼接伪影并输出尺度不变的深度，显著提升零样本全景深度估计性能，达到了新的SOTA。

Abstract: Panoramic depth estimation provides a comprehensive solution for capturing complete $360^\circ$ environmental structural information, offering significant benefits for robotics and AR/VR applications. However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds. This is complemented by integrating circular padding into the DPT decoder to eliminate seam artifacts, ensuring spatially coherent depth maps that respect spherical continuity. Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\% and 10\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively. Furthermore, DA360 significantly outperforms robust panoramic depth estimation methods, achieving about 30\% relative error improvement compared to PanDA across all three test datasets and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot panoramic depth estimation.

Result: 在自然图像、航拍与卫星遥感数据上实验证明KANO能更准确地捕捉谱域特征并提供更可解释的SR表现；比较显示KAN在复杂序列拟合上比MLP在某些场景具有更好结构化表达能力，但也存在局限。

Conclusion: KANO能以物理可解释的方式拟合图像退化的谱特征（局部线性趋势、峰-谷等非线性拐点），为可解释SR提供有效新路线；同时通过理论与实验证明KAN在复杂序列拟合上具有不同于MLP的优势与局限。

Abstract: The highly nonlinear degradation process, complex physical interactions, and various sources of uncertainty render single-image Super-resolution (SR) a particularly challenging task. Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks. This comparative study elucidates the respective advantages and limitations of these models in characterizing intricate degradation mechanisms, offering valuable insights for the development of interpretable SR techniques.

Abstract: Change detection plays a vital role in scene monitoring, exploration, and continual reconstruction. Existing 3D change detection methods often exhibit spatial inconsistency in the detected changes and fail to explicitly separate pre- and post-change states. To address these limitations, we propose SCaR-3D, a novel 3D scene change detection framework that identifies object-level changes from a dense-view pre-change image sequence and sparse-view post-change images. Our approach consists of a signed-distance-based 2D differencing module followed by multi-view aggregation with voting and pruning, leveraging the consistent nature of 3DGS to robustly separate pre- and post-change states. We further develop a continual scene reconstruction strategy that selectively updates dynamic regions while preserving the unchanged areas. We also contribute CCS3D, a challenging synthetic dataset that allows flexible combinations of 3D change types to support controlled evaluations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves both high accuracy and efficiency, outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: Combine camera-IMU vertical direction to reduce DOF and exploit affine correspondences to estimate relative pose and focal length robustly with minimal data

Method: New solver for 3DOF pose+focal from two ACs with known vertical

Result: Derived four polynomial equations in two unknowns (focal length and rotation angle); solved via polynomial eigenvalue method; validated on synthetic and real datasets with better performance than state-of-the-art

Conclusion: The proposed minimal solver reliably estimates focal length and 3DOF relative pose from two affine correspondences when vertical direction is known, showing superior accuracy in experiments

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to estimate the relative pose and focal length between two views with known intrinsic parameters except for an unknown focal length from two affine correspondences (ACs). Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) video generation has garnered increasing attention due to its promising applications in digital humans, e-commerce, advertising, and robotics imitation learning. However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.

Conclusion: MUSON 填补了现有社交导航数据集中推理监督匮乏与动作长尾分布的问题，提供结构化标注和合理动作设计，使其成为评估与训练可解释、安全的短期社交导航决策模型的有效基准。

Abstract: Socially compliant navigation requires structured reasoning over dynamic pedestrians and physical constraints to ensure safe and interpretable decisions. However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

TL;DR: 提出Lamps，一种在胸片上用自监督学习学习解剖结构的方法，通过一致性、连贯性和层次性三种解剖学视角作为监督信号，提升鲁棒性与迁移能力，在10个数据集上优于10个基线模型。


<details>

Motivation: 当前SSL方法在医学影像中忽视了解剖学的固有结构，限制了其学习解剖特征的能力；而人类解剖学的一致性、连贯性和层次性是监督模型学习的重要资源。

Method: 在大规模胸片上进行自监督训练，设计利用解剖学的一致性、连贯性与层次性作为监督信号的学习策略（未具体给出算法细节），并与10个基线模型比较，通过微调和 emergent property 分析评估性能。

Result: 在10个数据集上的微调与特性分析表明，Lamps在鲁棒性、迁移性与临床潜力方面均优于10个基线模型。

Conclusion: Lamps通过从多视角学习解剖结构，能在临床影像任务中学习到有意义且鲁棒的表征，具有更好的迁移性和临床潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models have been successful in natural language processing and computer vision because they are capable of capturing the underlying structures (foundation) of natural languages. However, in medical imaging, the key foundation lies in human anatomy, as these images directly represent the internal structures of the body, reflecting the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy. Yet, existing self-supervised learning (SSL) methods often overlook these perspectives, limiting their ability to effectively learn anatomical features. To overcome the limitation, we built Lamps (learning anatomy from multiple perspectives via self-supervision) pre-trained on large-scale chest radiographs by harmoniously utilizing the consistency, coherence, and hierarchy of human anatomy as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments across 10 datasets evaluated through fine-tuning and emergent property analysis demonstrate Lamps' superior robustness, transferability, and clinical potential when compared to 10 baseline models. By learning from multiple perspectives, Lamps presents a unique opportunity for foundation models to develop meaningful, robust representations that are aligned with the structure of human anatomy.

Abstract: Deep learning models are known to often learn features that spuriously correlate with the class label during training but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying, neutralizing, eliminating and updating procedures, we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation. Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show an improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models may generate harmful or copyrighted content, motivating research on concept erasure. However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: The recent integration of artificial intelligence into medical imaging has driven remarkable advances in automated organ segmentation. However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging.

*Haosen Li,Wenshuo Chen,Shaofeng Liang,Lei Wang,Haozhe Jia,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Guided Path Sampling (GPS)，替代CFG的外推为流形约束插值，保证采样路径留在数据流形上，使误差有界并稳定迭代精炼，同时设计动态引导强度调度，在SDXL等模型上提升质量与语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于去噪-反演循环的迭代精炼方法在结合传统CFG时失效，原因是CFG的外推特性将采样路径推离数据流形，导致近似误差发散，削弱精炼效果，因此需一种保持路径稳定于数据流形的引导方法。

Method: 分析CFG导致采样路径离开数据流形并使误差放大；提出在去噪-反演循环中用流形约束的插值替换外推（GPS），并证明此修正使误差有界；设计按生成粗到细进程动态调整引导强度的最优调度策略；在SDXL、Hunyuan-DiT上做大量实验验证。

Result: 在SDXL上GPS获得ImageReward 0.79、HPS v2 0.2995；GenEval整体语义对齐准确率提升到57.45%；在SDXL与Hunyuan-DiT上在感知质量和复杂提示遵从性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPS通过将CFG的外推改为流形约束插值，理论上将误差序列从发散变为有界，从而保证迭代精炼的稳定性；配合动态调度，在多个基线模型上显著提升感知质量与复杂提示的遵从性。

Abstract: Iterative refinement methods based on a denoising-inversion cycle are powerful tools for enhancing the quality and control of diffusion models. However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process. Extensive experiments on modern backbones like SDXL and Hunyuan-DiT show that GPS outperforms existing methods in both perceptual quality and complex prompt adherence. For instance, GPS achieves a superior ImageReward of 0.79 and HPS v2 of 0.2995 on SDXL, while improving overall semantic alignment accuracy on GenEval to 57.45%. Our work establishes that path stability is a prerequisite for effective iterative refinement, and GPS provides a robust framework to achieve it.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune invalid hash-grid features using Gaussian splat coordinates to cut storage/transmission; achieves ~8% bitrate reduction under standard tests with no performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce storage and transmission overhead caused by invalid features in hash grids when representing Gaussian splats in 3D space for neural fields.

Method: Identify invalid features by mapping Gaussian splat coordinates to hash-grid cells and prune features unused by any splat; encode only the remaining valid features.

Result: Proposed a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and removes invalid features based on Gaussian splat coordinates, encoding only valid features, achieving 8% average bitrate reduction under CTC without performance loss.

Conclusion: Hash grid pruning based on splat coordinates effectively reduces storage and bitrate while maintaining model performance, improving rate-distortion.

Abstract: Hash grids are widely used to learn an implicit neural field for Gaussian splatting, serving either as part of the entropy model or for inter-frame prediction. However, due to the irregular and non-uniform distribution of Gaussian splats in 3D space, numerous sparse regions exist, rendering many features in the hash grid invalid. This leads to redundant storage and transmission overhead. In this work, we propose a hash grid feature pruning method that identifies and prunes invalid features based on the coordinates of the input Gaussian splats, so that only the valid features are encoded. This approach reduces the storage size of the hash grid without compromising model performance, leading to improved rate-distortion performance. Following the Common Test Conditions (CTC) defined by the standardization committee, our method achieves an average bitrate reduction of 8% compared to the baseline approach.

Abstract: This paper presents JavisGPT, the first unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) for Joint Audio-Video (JAV) comprehension and generation. JavisGPT adopts a concise encoder-LLM-decoder architecture, featuring a SyncFusion module for spatio-temporal audio-video fusion and synchrony-aware learnable queries to bridge a pretrained JAV-DiT generator.

To support this, we further construct JavisInst-Omni, a high-quality instruction dataset with over 200K GPT-4o-curated audio-video-text dialogues that span diverse and multi-level comprehension and generation scenarios. Extensive experiments on JAV comprehension and generation benchmarks show that JavisGPT outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in complex and temporally synchronized settings.

Conclusion: ColaVLA 在 nuScenes 数据集上在开环和闭环评估中均表现出最先进的性能，同时具备较低延迟和更强鲁棒性，证明将VLM推理压缩到潜在空间并采用并行层次规划是可行且有效的策略。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires generating safe and reliable trajectories from complex multimodal inputs. Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly. Vision-language models (VLMs) further enrich this paradigm by introducing cross-modal priors and commonsense reasoning, yet current VLM-based planners face three key challenges: (i) a mismatch between discrete text reasoning and continuous control, (ii) high latency from autoregressive chain-of-thought decoding, and (iii) inefficient or non-causal planners that limit real-time deployment. We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass. Together, these components preserve the generalization and interpretability of VLMs while enabling efficient, accurate and safe trajectory generation. Experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that ColaVLA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings with favorable efficiency and robustness.

Conclusion: DRMNet通过密度先验引导和频域分离融合，有效聚焦稠密区域并抑制背景干扰，显著提升了高分辨率遥感图像中稠密微小目标的检测性能。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing imagery increasingly contains dense clusters of tiny objects, the detection of which is extremely challenging due to severe mutual occlusion and limited pixel footprints. Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction. Finally, to mitigate feature degradation during hierarchical extraction, we introduce a Dual Filter Fusion Module (DFFM). It disentangles multi-scale features into high- and low-frequency components using a discrete cosine transform and then performs density-guided cross-attention to enhance complementarity while suppressing background interference. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD and DTOD datasets demonstrate that DRMNet surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly in complex scenarios with high object density and severe occlusion.

Abstract: Conventional object detectors rely on cross-entropy classification, which can be vulnerable to class imbalance and label noise. We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: WRCFormer有效缓解了雷达稀疏性与信息丢失问题，同时在计算效率与检测精度之间取得平衡，显著提升了4D雷达-相机融合的3D检测性能，尤其在恶劣天气条件下更为鲁棒。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has been widely adopted in autonomous driving and robot perception due to its low cost and all-weather robustness. However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose WRCFormer, a novel 3D object detection framework that fuses raw radar cubes with camera inputs via multi-view representations of the decoupled radar cube. Specifically, we design a Wavelet Attention Module as the basic module of wavelet-based Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the representation of sparse radar signals and image data. We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WRCFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the K-Radar benchmarks, surpassing the best model by approximately 2.4% in all scenarios and 1.6% in the sleet scenario, highlighting its robustness under adverse weather conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: alleviate catastrophic forgetting in real-time YOLO-based incremental object detection by identifying and addressing three conflict types: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation

Method: stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained YOLO-World model

Result: proposed YOLO-IOD with CPR, IKS, CAKD components and LoCo COCO benchmark; shows superior performance and minimal forgetting on conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks

Conclusion: YOLO-IOD在保持实时性的同时，通过冲突感知伪标注精炼、基于重要性的核更新和跨阶段非对称蒸馏，有效减少YOLO增量检测中的灾难性遗忘，并在新提出的无数据泄漏基准上表现优异。

Abstract: Current methods for incremental object detection (IOD) primarily rely on Faster R-CNN or DETR series detectors; however, these approaches do not accommodate the real-time YOLO detection frameworks. In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.

*Chunyuan Chen,Yunuo Cai,Shujuan Li,Weiyun Liang,Bin Wang,Jing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ReamCamo，一种基于out-painting的伪装图像生成框架，通过布局控制和多模态文本-视觉条件提升前景与背景语义一致性与视觉真实感，并引入背景-前景分布差异度量评估伪装效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CIG方法生成图像要么伪装不足（视觉相似性弱），要么背景语义与前景不一致（背景混乱），导致与真实伪装图像存在显著差距，影响COD训练效果。

Method: 基于out-painting生成流程，ReamCamo引入额外布局控制用于调节全局结构；构建多模态条件：细粒度文本任务描述 + 纹理导向背景检索，共同引导生成以提高视觉逼真性；并提出背景-前景分布差异度量用于量化伪装效果。

Result: 大量实验与可视化表明ReamCamo在视觉保真、语义一致性及伪装有效性上均优于现有方法，指标和主观评估均有提升。

Conclusion: ReamCamo显著改善了生成图像的伪装质量与语义一致性，在实验和可视化结果中优于现有方法，对提高COD训练数据质量具有实际价值。

Abstract: Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

*Huiming Yang,Linglin Liao,Fei Ding,Sibo Wang,Zijian Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PoseStreamer，多模态用于高速运动下的6DoF位姿估计；包含自适应姿态记忆队列、目标中心化2D跟踪器和沿光线的姿态滤波；并构建MoCapCube6D数据集，在高速运动中表现更好并具备无模板泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在高速、低光场景受运动模糊影响，导致6DoF估计性能下降；事件相机高时序特性有潜力，但现有方法在高速目标运动下表现仍欠佳，需要结合多模态与时序几何约束提升鲁棒性。

Method: PoseStreamer包含三部分：1) Adaptive Pose Memory Queue：利用历史方向线索保持时序一致性；2) Object-centric 2D Tracker：提供强2D先验以提升3D中心召回率；3) Ray Pose Filter：沿相机光线进行几何精细化。框架为模板无关，可处理未见目标；同时构建MoCapCube6D多模态高速数据集用于评测。

Result: 在MoCapCube6D及其他测试中，PoseStreamer在高速运动场景下精度优于现有方法，3D中心召回和位姿估计更稳定，且在未见物体上展现出较好泛化能力。

Conclusion: PoseStreamer通过融合历史姿态记忆、目标中心2D先验和光线几何滤波，显著提升了高速移动场景下的6DoF估计性能，且其无模板设计增强了对新物体的适应性。

Abstract: Six degree of freedom (6DoF) pose estimation for novel objects is a critical task in computer vision, yet it faces significant challenges in high-speed and low-light scenarios where standard RGB cameras suffer from motion blur. While event cameras offer a promising solution due to their high temporal resolution, current 6DoF pose estimation methods typically yield suboptimal performance in high-speed object moving scenarios. To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseStreamer not only achieves superior accuracy in high-speed moving scenarios, but also exhibits strong generalizability as a template-free framework for unseen moving objects.

*Linglin Liao,Qichuan Geng,Yu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSA，通过对称最优传输对齐与区域级方向性引导掩码，将定位信息与描述/诊断文本有效融合，实现更准确的文本引导医学图像分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时处理诊断性与描述性文本，难以在图像中定位病变并建立与图像区域的对应；且缺乏对文本中位置信息的建模，会导致分割结果出现重要的空间偏差，例如将“左下肺”错误分割到双侧。

Method: 提出对称最优传输（symmetric optimal transport）对齐机制，以在图像区域与多样化文本表达之间建立双向细粒度对应关系；并设计复合方向性引导策略，通过构建区域级引导掩码，将文本中的空间约束显式引入模型。

Result: 在公共基准数据集上的大量实验表明，SSA达到或超过现有SOTA水平，尤其在具有空间关系约束的病变分割任务中效果显著提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) 框架有效提升了文本引导医学图像分割的性能，尤其在处理同时包含定位、描述和诊断信息的混合文本方面表现优越，能更准确地将文本中空间关系约束映射到图像分割结果，从而减少位置偏差。

Abstract: Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text "in the left lower lung", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于条件扩散反演的逆向个性化面部匿名化方法，通过身份引导分支实现对训练数据外主体的泛化，支持属性可控的匿名化，在身份去除、属性保留与图像质量上取得SOTA级平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的文本到图像扩散模型在去除或修改身份特征时依赖于目标在预训练模型中的表示或需要对特定身份微调，缺乏对面部属性的控制能力，因此有必要提出一种不依赖提示或微调、并可控制属性的匿名化方法。

Method: 提出条件扩散反演（conditional diffusion inversion）作为核心，通过引入身份引导的条件分支，使模型能针对训练集中未充分覆盖的主体进行泛化；在无需文本提示或针对性微调的情况下直接在潜变量/图像空间操作，以实现匿名化并支持面部属性控制。

Result: 在多个评估指标上（身份去除效果、面部属性保持度、生成图像质量）相比先前方法取得更优（或达到SOTA）平衡；并提供代码和数据以便复现。

Conclusion: 本文提出了逆向个性化（reverse personalization）框架用于面部匿名化，通过条件扩散反演直接操控图像，以移除或修改身份特征，且支持可控属性保留，达到在身份去除、属性保持和图像质量间的较好平衡。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation of realistic facial images conditioned on textual prompts and human identities, enabling creating personalized facial imagery. However, existing prompt-based methods for removing or modifying identity-specific features rely either on the subject being well-represented in the pre-trained model or require model fine-tuning for specific identities. In this work, we analyze the identity generation process and introduce a reverse personalization framework for face anonymization. Our approach leverages conditional diffusion inversion, allowing direct manipulation of images without using text prompts. To generalize beyond subjects in the model's training data, we incorporate an identity-guided conditioning branch. Unlike prior anonymization methods, which lack control over facial attributes, our framework supports attribute-controllable anonymization. We demonstrate that our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between identity removal, attribute preservation, and image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of pre-defined OLTs for 3D visual grounding, enabling open-world targets

Method: Paper analysis

Result: Competitive on Nr3D, SOTA on ScanRefer, +17.6% on OpenTarget

Conclusion: OpenGround extends VLM cognition with ACR to handle open-world categories, showing strong empirical gains

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to locate objects based on natural language descriptions in 3D scenes. Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强调上下文信息（空间关系、材质、共现）对目标识别的重要性，并提出显式图结构以增强可解释性

Method: 结合单目深度估计与统一的全景+材质分割生成带节点（几何、色彩、材质）和边（空间关系）的GSCG；设计图神经网络分类器聚合目标、邻域与全局特征；通过消融验证上下文贡献和与ResNet、Llama 4 Scout比较

Conclusion: 显式、结构化的上下文建模能显著提升目标分类性能并提高可解释性，优于常规卷积基线和多模态LLM

Abstract: Humans effortlessly identify objects by leveraging a rich understanding of the surrounding scene, including spatial relationships, material properties, and the co-occurrence of other objects. In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that our context-aware model achieves a classification accuracy of 73.4%, dramatically outperforming context-agnostic versions (as low as 38.4%). Furthermore, our GSCG-based approach significantly surpasses strong baselines, including fine-tuned ResNet models (max 53.5%) and a state-of-the-art multimodal Large Language Model (LLM), Llama 4 Scout, which, even when given the full image alongside a detailed description of objects, maxes out at 42.3%. These results on COCO 2017 train/val splits highlight the superiority of explicitly structured and interpretable context for object recognition tasks.

Motivation: Analyze architecture-led mapping between modern VLMs and a practical video-to-artifact pipeline; explain implications for engineering and evaluation.

Method: 架构层面分析（视觉tokenization、Transformer attention机制、指令跟随能力），系统映射到BodyLanguageDetection流水线，结合提示契约与schema验证实践进行行为-约束对照分析。

Result: Comparison of Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct; description of shared multimodal components; mapping to BodyLanguageDetection pipeline; identification of limitations: syntactic vs semantic validity, schema vs geometric correctness, frame-local identifiers, free-form single-frame outputs.

Conclusion: 理解VLM架构和输出约束对构建可靠视频分析系统至关重要；应在规范、提示工程、验证和评估设计上显式考虑语义/几何错误、跨帧ID一致性与输出格式保障。

Abstract: This report provides an architecture-led analysis of two modern vision-language models (VLMs), Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E-Instruct, and explains how their architectural properties map to a practical video-to-artifact pipeline implemented in the BodyLanguageDetection repository [1]. The system samples video frames, prompts a VLM to detect visible people and generate pixel-space bounding boxes with prompt-conditioned attributes (emotion by default), validates output structure using a predefined schema, and optionally renders an annotated video. We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON. These distinctions are critical for writing defensible claims, designing robust interfaces, and planning evaluation.

TL;DR: Co2S用CLIP和DINOv3分别作为两个学生的先验，结合文本嵌入与可学习query的显隐引导，并融合全局与局部特征，显著抑制伪标签漂移，提升半监督遥感分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督遥感分割受伪标签漂移（confirmation bias导致训练中错误累积）制约，单一模型先验难以同时兼顾全局语义与局部细节，因此通过融合视觉语言模型与自监督模型先验以增强稳定性与精度。

Method: 1) 异构双学生：两个基于ViT的学生分别用CLIP和DINOv3初始化，减少伪标签误差累积。2) 显隐语义协同引导：用文本嵌入（显）与可学习queries（隐）提供类级语义一致性引导。3) 全局-局部特征协同融合：融合CLIP捕捉的全局上下文与DINOv3的局部细节来提升分割精度。

Result: 提出Co2S框架，通过融合CLIP与DINOv3的先验，缓解半监督遥感图像语义分割中的伪标签漂移问题。设计了异构双学生结构与显隐语义协同引导、全局-局部特征协同融合策略，实现更稳健和精确的分割。

Conclusion: Co2S通过异构双学生、显隐语义协同引导和全局-局部特征融合，有效缓解了伪标签漂移问题，在六个数据集和多种划分策略上均表现优越，证明了将视觉语言模型与自监督模型融合于半监督遥感分割的可行性与优势。

Abstract: Semi-supervised remote sensing (RS) image semantic segmentation offers a promising solution to alleviate the burden of exhaustive annotation, yet it fundamentally struggles with pseudo-label drift, a phenomenon where confirmation bias leads to the accumulation of errors during training. In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

Method: 提出LAM3C框架：基于视频生成的点云数据集RoomTours，使用多层次Laplacian约束的聚类与Sinkhorn-Knopp进行自监督训练；引入噪声正则化损失以增强局部几何平滑与特征在噪声点云下的稳定性。

Conclusion: 视频生成点云可以在无真实3D扫描数据下实现有效的自监督3D表示学习，且在室内语义与实例分割任务上优于以前的方法。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D self-supervised learning, collecting large-scale 3D scene scans remains expensive and labor-intensive. In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model. We also propose a noise-regularized loss that stabilizes representation learning by enforcing local geometric smoothness and ensuring feature stability under noisy point clouds. Remarkably, without using any real 3D scans, LAM3C achieves higher performance than the previous self-supervised methods on indoor semantic and instance segmentation. These results suggest that unlabeled videos represent an abundant source of data for 3D self-supervised learning.

Result: Video-BrowseComp benchmark with 210 questions; state-of-the-art search-augmented models (e.g., GPT-5.1 w/ Search) achieve only 15.24% accuracy; models rely on textual proxies and fail in metadata-sparse domains

Conclusion: Video-BrowseComp推动从被动视频理解走向主动、基于时间线的视频推理，揭示现有模型在跨模态检索与验证方面的不足，需要更强的视觉 grounding 和检索策略

Abstract: The evolution of autonomous agents is redefining information seeking, transitioning from passive retrieval to proactive, open-ended web research. However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential. As the first open-web video research benchmark, Video-BrowseComp advances the field beyond passive perception toward proactive video reasoning.

Method: 使用公开图像-掩码数据微调MedSAM以提取肺区；在NIH CXR子集上训练多标签CNN（例如ResNet50）预测五种病变，并通过三种输入策略（原图、松掩码、紧掩码）比较性能（macro AUROC、No Finding得分等）。

Result: MedSAM用于胸片分割并引导多标签病变分类，表现与遮罩紧松和模型结构相关，提出将肺区遮罩作为可控空间先验。

Conclusion: 肺区分割可作为有用的空间先验，但应作为可调控策略使用。不同遮罩范围对异常检测与正常筛查有权衡，且受模型架构影响。

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is widely used for screening and diagnosing pulmonary abnormalities, yet automated interpretation remains challenging due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.

Method: 方法包括：1) 将影像分解为确定性的解剖重建与随机的病理残差；2) 在残差（偏差）空间训练条件扩散模型以建模局部强度变化；3) 引入接缝感知融合策略和推理时稳定化模块以保持空间一致性并抑制边界伪影；4) 在患者特异性合成与病程反事实建模中应用该框架。

Result: PathoSyn提出了一个在稳定解剖流形上，将病理表现视为可分离的加性偏差的统一生成框架，通过将合成任务分解为确定性的解剖重建和随机的偏差建模，利用偏差空间的扩散模型学习病理残差的条件分布，并配合接缝感知融合与推理时稳定化模块抑制边界伪影，从而在保全全局结构下生成高保真病灶细节。

Conclusion: PathoSyn在肿瘤成像基准上在感知逼真度和解剖保真度方面明显优于整体扩散和掩码条件基线方法，提供了数学上有根据的病理合成流程，有助于低样本情形下诊断算法的鲁棒性开发与精确干预规划。

Abstract: We present PathoSyn, a unified generative framework for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) image synthesis that reformulates imaging-pathology as a disentangled additive deviation on a stable anatomical manifold. Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity. The source code of this work will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced deformable image registration, surpassing traditional optimization-based methods in both accuracy and efficiency. However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers. These findings identify local feature consistency as the key driver of robustness in learning-based deformable registration and motivate backbone designs that preserve domain-invariant local features.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoTeacher transfers teacher's geometric knowledge via keypoint supervision and diversifies geometries with voxel-wise augmentation (distance-decay) to boost SS3D performance


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled data scarcity leads to poor geometric sensitivity; teacher-student lacks geometry transfer

Method: Keypoint-based geometric relation transfer + voxel-wise augmentation

Result: Improved student geometry understanding and detection; SOTA on ONCE and Waymo

Conclusion: GeoTeacher effectively enhances geometric perception in semi-supervised 3D detection, generalizes across datasets and methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection, aiming to explore unlabeled data for boosting 3D object detectors, has emerged as an active research area in recent years. Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 提出REVEALER：一种基于强化学习的多模态视觉推理框架，实现元素级对齐评估并获得SOTA与高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法粗糙或基于静态QA，缺乏细粒度可解释性且难以贴合人类偏好；因此需要一种能显式定位元素并提供可解释判断的统一评估框架。

Method: 采用“定位-推理-结论”结构范式，利用多模态大模型执行显式语义元素定位并推理对齐性；训练上引入Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO)，并用结构格式、定位准确性和对齐保真度构成的复合奖励函数优化模型。

Result: 在四个基准（EvalMuse-40K、RichHF、MHaluBench、GenAI-Bench）上，REVEALER取得了SOTA表现，优于强大的专有模型和监督基线，并在推理效率上胜过现有迭代式视觉推理方法。

Conclusion: REVEALER通过强化学习引导的视觉推理，实现了细粒度元素级对齐评估，提升了对齐判定的可解释性与效果。

Abstract: Evaluating the alignment between textual prompts and generated images is critical for ensuring the reliability and usability of text-to-image (T2I) models. However, most existing evaluation methods rely on coarse-grained metrics or static QA pipelines, which lack fine-grained interpretability and struggle to reflect human preferences. To address this, we propose REVEALER, a unified framework for element-level alignment evaluation based on reinforcement-guided visual reasoning. Adopting a structured "grounding-reasoning-conclusion" paradigm, our method enables Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to explicitly localize semantic elements and derive interpretable alignment judgments. We optimize the model via Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO) using a composite reward function that incorporates structural format, grounding accuracy, and alignment fidelity. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks-EvalMuse-40K, RichHF, MHaluBench, and GenAI-Bench-demonstrate that REVEALER achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our approach consistently outperforms both strong proprietary models and supervised baselines while demonstrating superior inference efficiency compared to existing iterative visual reasoning methods.

TL;DR: 提出GVSynergy-Det，通过协同高斯-体素双表示学习提升基于图像的三维目标检测；高斯表示建模细节，体素表示提供结构上下文，两者通过可学习融合互补提升定位精度；无需深度或稠密三维监督，在ScanNetV2和ARKitScenes上达SOTA。

Conclusion: GVSynergy-Det在无需深度或稠密三维几何监督的条件下，利用高斯与体素双表示互补融合，显著提升了室内图像基础的3D检测性能，并在ScanNetV2与ARKitScenes上实现了领先结果。

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection aims to identify and localize objects in 3D space using only RGB images, eliminating the need for expensive depth sensors required by point cloud-based methods. Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).

Conclusion: 基于3D高斯表示的DWM能同时支持理解与生成，文本-3D早期对齐与语言引导采样提升了效率与对齐精度，双条件生成进一步增强生成质量

Abstract: Driving World Models (DWMs) have been developing rapidly with the advances of generative models. However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We will release the code publicly on GitHub https://github.com/dtc111111/GaussianDWM.

Abstract: This research proposes "ForCM", a novel approach to forest cover mapping that combines Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) with Deep Learning (DL) using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA.

Abstract: Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have brought tremendous advances in generative tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance thus far. Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries. We empirically validate our learnable timestep consolidation method on the large-scale challenging Taskonomy dataset for dense prediction, particularly for practical universal and few-shot learning scenarios.

Conclusion: AVOID 填补了在不良环境下小路障检测数据的空白，支持多种视觉感知任务，并为实时检测模型提供了评估基准。

Abstract: Understanding road scenes for visual perception remains crucial for intelligent self-driving cars. In particular, it is desirable to detect unexpected small road hazards reliably in real-time, especially under varying adverse conditions (e.g., weather and daylight). However, existing road driving datasets provide large-scale images acquired in either normal or adverse scenarios only, and often do not contain the road obstacles captured in the same visual domain as for the other classes. To address this, we introduce a new dataset called AVOID, the Adverse Visual Conditions Dataset, for real-time obstacle detection collected in a simulated environment. AVOID consists of a large set of unexpected road obstacles located along each path captured under various weather and time conditions. Each image is coupled with the corresponding semantic and depth maps, raw and semantic LiDAR data, and waypoints, thereby supporting most visual perception tasks. We benchmark the results on high-performing real-time networks for the obstacle detection task, and also propose and conduct ablation studies using a comprehensive multi-task network for semantic segmentation, depth and waypoint prediction tasks.

Motivation: Fill gap in evaluating MLLMs in low-altitude UAV scenarios by creating a unified benchmark covering perception, cognition, planning

Method: Paper analysis of MM-UAVBench

Result: Created MM-UAVBench: 19 sub-tasks, 5.7K+ annotated Qs from real UAV datasets; evaluated 16 MLLMs showing poor adaptation and revealed bottlenecks like spatial bias and multi-view understanding

Conclusion: MM-UAVBench highlights limitations of current MLLMs in UAV contexts and aims to drive research on robust, reliable multimodal models for UAV intelligence

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited remarkable general intelligence across diverse domains, their potential in low-altitude applications dominated by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) remains largely underexplored. Existing MLLM benchmarks rarely cover the unique challenges of low-altitude scenarios, while UAV-related evaluations mainly focus on specific tasks such as localization or navigation, without a unified evaluation of MLLMs'general intelligence. To bridge this gap, we present MM-UAVBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates MLLMs across three core capability dimensions-perception, cognition, and planning-in low-altitude UAV scenarios. MM-UAVBench comprises 19 sub-tasks with over 5.7K manually annotated questions, all derived from real-world UAV data collected from public datasets. Extensive experiments on 16 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveal that current models struggle to adapt to the complex visual and cognitive demands of low-altitude scenarios. Our analyses further uncover critical bottlenecks such as spatial bias and multi-view understanding that hinder the effective deployment of MLLMs in UAV scenarios. We hope MM-UAVBench will foster future research on robust and reliable MLLMs for real-world UAV intelligence.

Conclusion: 将三类上下文显式整合进检测Transformer能有效减少类别与外观歧义，从而提升服装物品检测性能。

Abstract: Fashion item detection is challenging due to the ambiguities introduced by the highly diverse appearances of fashion items and the similarities among item subcategories. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).

Conclusion: UniMAGE有效统一脚本与关键帧生成，通过交织学习提升想象力和语义理解，再通过解耦学习增强创作灵活性，最终在长上下文、多镜头影片创作任务上优于现有开源方法。

Abstract: Existing AI-driven video creation systems typically treat script drafting and key-shot design as two disjoint tasks: the former relies on large language models, while the latter depends on image generation models. We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniMAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models, generating logically coherent video scripts and visually consistent keyframe images.

TL;DR: 用文本引导的图像翻译模型+图像检索筛选器生成高质量合成缺陷图，先用大量规则合成图预训练再用少量优质图微调，提高检测性能并降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实缺陷图稀缺，规则合成图真实度低但成本低；生成模型能产高质量图但成本高，需一种在成本与效果间平衡的合成策略。

Method: 1) 用文本引导的图像到图像翻译模型生成多样缺陷图；2) 用图像检索模型评估生成图与真实正常图相似度并筛除不相关样本；3) 两阶段训练：先用大量规则合成图预训练，再用少量高质量生成图微调。

Result: The paper proposes a framework to generate high-quality synthetic defect images efficiently by combining a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model with an image retrieval model, and a two-stage training strategy that pre-trains on many rule-based synthetic images and fine-tunes on fewer high-quality generated images.

Conclusion: 结合检索筛选的文本引导图像翻译与两阶段训练能在成本可控下显著提升工业缺陷检测性能，且在MVTec AD上验证有效。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing. Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SGPS用SURE梯度和PCA噪声估计在扩散逆问题求解中纠正采样偏差，显著降低误差累积，使高质量重建在低于100次NFE时成为可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交替扩散采样与数据一致性的方法需要大量步数（上百到上千）以获得高质量重建，原因在于噪声引起的误差累积。需要一种在低NFE下仍能保持高重建质量的策略。

Method: 在扩散模型的迭代解算过程中，交替进行扩散采样和数据一致性步骤，利用SURE提供的无偏风险估计计算梯度以修正采样轨迹，同时用PCA估计噪声成分并在早中期进行校正，从而减少误差累积并加速收敛。

Result: 提出了一种利用SURE引导的后验采样方法（SGPS），在扩散模型求解逆问题时，通过SURE梯度更新和基于PCA的噪声估计修正采样轨迹偏差，减少噪声在早中期采样阶段造成的误差累积。能够在少于100次神经函数评估（NFE）下保持高质量重建，在多项逆问题上优于现有低NFE方法。

Conclusion: SGPS通过降低噪声导致的早中期误差累积，实现更准确的后验采样，并在低NFE条件下优于现有方法，适用于多种逆问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful learned priors for solving inverse problems. However, current iterative solving approaches which alternate between diffusion sampling and data consistency steps typically require hundreds or thousands of steps to achieve high quality reconstruction due to accumulated errors. We address this challenge with SURE Guided Posterior Sampling (SGPS), a method that corrects sampling trajectory deviations using Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (SURE) gradient updates and PCA based noise estimation. By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation. This allows our method to maintain high reconstruction quality with fewer than 100 Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs). Our extensive evaluation across diverse inverse problems demonstrates that SGPS consistently outperforms existing methods at low NFE counts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外气体泄漏图像中烟羽通常微弱、尺寸小、半透明且边界模糊，传统检测器难以提取有效边缘与传播信息，因此需要结合气体物理特性与边缘感知的网络结构来提升检测性能。

Method: 提出Gas Block（扩散-对流单元）用于模拟气体传输的局部与大尺度特征；引入AGPEO（自适应梯度与相位边缘算子）获得多方向和相位一致的边缘先验；通过MSEPM将边缘先验转为多尺度边缘特征；设计CASR-PAN（内容自适应稀疏路由路径聚合网络）并配合自适应信息调制模块，实现基于边缘与内容线索的跨尺度选择性特征传播。

Conclusion: 本文提出的PEG-DRNet在红外气体泄漏检测方面表现优异，兼顾检测精度与计算效率，能更好地捕捉微弱、半透明且边界差的烟羽特征。

Abstract: Detecting infrared gas leaks is critical for environmental monitoring and industrial safety, yet remains difficult because plumes are faint, small, semitransparent, and have weak, diffuse boundaries. We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\%, 6.5\%, and 5.3\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters. The proposed PEG-DRNet achieves superior overall performance with the best balance of accuracy and computational efficiency, outperforming existing CNN and Transformer detectors in AP and AP$_{50}$ on the IIG and LangGas dataset.

Motivation: 遥感扩散生成模型依赖大量数据，但数据往往存在冗余、噪声和类别不平衡，降低训练效率并阻碍模型收敛；现有聚合数据集或简单去重方法忽视了生成建模的分布需求与遥感影像的异质性，因此需要高效的数据筛选策略。

Abstract: Diffusion-based remote sensing (RS) generative foundation models are cruial for downstream tasks. However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis. This data pruning paradigm offers practical guidance for developing RS generative foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DRIS+MS-VLAM的VLM框架，通过动态分辨率与三级对齐提高遥感多模态理解的精度与效率，在RS-GPT4V上取得优于传统方法的指标表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分辨率选择和单尺度对齐方面存在不足：固定分辨率难以在效率与细节间平衡，单尺度对齐缺乏语义层次导致对齐不精准；因此需要兼顾精度与计算资源的多尺度对齐策略。

Method: 提出基于视觉-语言模型的整体框架，结合动态分辨率输入策略（DRIS）和多尺度视觉-语言对齐机制（MS-VLAM）。DRIS通过粗到细分配计算资源，保留细粒度特征并降低冗余计算；MS-VLAM构建对象、局部区域和全局三级对齐，捕获跨模态语义一致性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个面向遥感图像的多模态融合框架，旨在提升语义理解精度和计算效率，具有一定理论与工程价值。

Abstract: Multimodal fusion of remote sensing images serves as a core technology for overcoming the limitations of single-source data and improving the accuracy of surface information extraction, which exhibits significant application value in fields such as environmental monitoring and urban planning. To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval. This technical framework provides a novel approach for constructing efficient and robust multimodal remote sensing systems, laying a theoretical foundation and offering technical guidance for the engineering application of intelligent remote sensing interpretation.

*Xingwei Ma,Shiyang Feng,Bo Zhang,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该文提出ViLaCD-R1，两阶段结合VLM和像素解码器提升遥感变化检测的语义识别与定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有像素或编码器-解码器方法语义捕捉不足且易受非语义扰动；现有VLM方法虽增强语义理解但定位、边界和可解释性欠佳，因此需要结合VLM语义能力与像素级精细解码。

Method: 两阶段：1) 多图推理器(MIR)：对VLM进行块级双时相监督微调和强化学习，输入双时相图像块，输出粗略变化掩码；2) 掩码引导解码器(MGD)：将双时相图像特征与粗掩码融合，预测精细二值变化图。

Result: 在多项遥感变化检测基准上，ViLaCD-R1在语义正确性、定位精度与鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法，尤其在复杂现实场景下表现出色。

Conclusion: ViLaCD-R1在多个RSCD基准上显著提升语义变化识别与定位精度，有效抑制非语义干扰，实现了复杂场景下的最先进性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD), a complex multi-image inference task, traditionally uses pixel-based operators or encoder-decoder networks that inadequately capture high-level semantics and are vulnerable to non-semantic perturbations. Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple RSCD benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaCD-R1 substantially improves true semantic change recognition and localization, robustly suppresses non-semantic variations, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in complex real-world scenarios.

*Shin seong Kim,Minjung Shin,Hyunin Cho,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ASemconsist框架，通过选择性修改文本嵌入实现对角色身份的一致语义控制，同时保持单张图像与提示对齐。利用FLUX中padding嵌入作为语义容器并引入自适应特征共享，只在文本歧义处施加约束；并提出统一评估指标CQS来综合身份保持与提示对齐。结果显示在两者间的平衡上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量且与提示对齐的单帧图像方面已很强，但在多场景下保持同一角色身份一致性时仍存在困难，且方法常在身份一致性与单图提示对齐之间存在不可避免的权衡。作者因此提出一种能对角色语义进行显式控制且最小化对其它提示信息影响的策略。

Method: 核心方法包括：1) 选择性文本嵌入修改——仅编辑与角色身份相关的语义子空间，保留其他提示信息以保持对齐；2) 将FLUX的padding嵌入重新用于承载角色语义（semantic container）；3) 自适应特征共享机制，根据提示的文本歧义性自动评估并仅对模糊的身份提示应用约束；4) 统一评估协议CQS，融合身份保持与单图提示对齐的得分并显式体现两者不平衡。

Result: 在多套基准上，ASemconsist在身份保持与提示对齐的综合指标CQS上超过先前方法，实验显示其在保持角色一致性的同时不会显著降低单图像的提示符合度，实验证明了padding嵌入作为语义容器和自适应特征共享的有效性。

Conclusion: ASemconsist能在不牺牲每张图像提示对齐度的情况下，显著提高跨场景角色身份一致性；通过利用padding嵌入和自适应特征共享，有效缓解了身份一致性与文本对齐的权衡，且在CQS指标上达到SOTA表现。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved visual quality and text alignment. However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs. Project page: https://minjung-s.github.io/asemconsist

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: existing 2DGS blurs edges when Gaussians few due to lack of contour awareness; incorporate segmentation priors to preserve edges under compression

Method: Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting

Result: constraining each Gaussian to specific segmentation region prevents cross-boundary blending; warm-up scheme stabilizes training; higher reconstruction quality around edges on synthetic color charts and DAVIS, especially with very few Gaussians; maintains fast rendering and low memory

Conclusion: 通过引入分割先验与预热训练策略，2DGS在边缘细节恢复方面取得明显进步，可在极少高斯条件下避免跨界混合，适合需要紧凑表达与高边缘保真度的应用。

Abstract: Image representation is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence. Experiments on synthetic color charts and the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves higher reconstruction quality around object edges compared to existing 2DGS methods. The improvement is particularly evident in scenarios with very few Gaussians, while our method still maintains fast rendering and low memory usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存加速方法虽无需训练但引入显著计算误差，且固定缓存策略无法适应去噪过程中误差的复杂变化，限制了误差校正效果的提升，因此需要一种自适应、训练无关且不增加额外开销的优化方法来最小化累积误差并提高生成保真度。

Method: 1) 预定义误差模型以联合刻画时间步与缓存间隔对误差的影响；2) 基于该误差先验，构建累积误差近似并设计动态规划算法优化缓存策略；3) 将CEM作为插件集成到现有误差校正与量化框架中，按不同加速预算输出最优缓存策略。

Result: 提出了一种称为CEM的保真度优化插件，通过累积误差最小化为现有缓存误差校正方法提供训练无关的加速优化。CEM预定义误差以联合刻画时间步和缓存间隔对模型对加速敏感性的影响，并基于此设计动态规划算法进行策略优化，从而最小化缓存引入的累积误差，提高生成保真度。该方法模型无关、适应不同加速预算、可无缝集成到现有误差校正框架和量化模型且不增加额外计算开销。实验证明在多个生成模型和任务上均显著提升保真度。

Conclusion: CEM能在不增加计算负担的情况下，通过策略优化显著降低缓存加速引入的累积误差，提升图像/视频生成的保真度，且具有良好泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: Although Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as a predominant architecture for image and video generation, its iterative denoising process results in slow inference, which hinders broader applicability and development. Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing error correction frameworks and quantized models without introducing any additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments conducted on nine generation models and quantized methods across three tasks demonstrate that CEM significantly improves generation fidelity of existing acceleration models, and outperforms the original generation performance on FLUX.1-dev, PixArt-$α$, StableDiffusion1.5 and Hunyuan. The code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有RTOD方法使用统一的密集计算在复杂与简单场景间无法动态分配计算资源，导致计算冗余和检测性能受限，尤其在密集场景下表现不足。

Method: 提出了Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE)模块，结合轻量级动态路由网络和多样性增强目标，动态选择并激活最相关的专家以分配计算资源，训练时通过路由网络指导专家专长化。

Result: 在五个大规模基准上进行实验。MS COCO上取得42.4% AP，1.62ms延迟，相比YOLOv13-N提升+0.8% mAP且推理速度提升17.8%，在复杂密集场景上的提升更明显，同时对典型输入保持高效与实时性。

Conclusion: YOLO-Master通过在YOLO-like架构中引入实例条件的自适应计算，有效缓解了静态密集计算导致的资源错配问题，从而在保持实时性的同时提升检测性能。

Abstract: Existing Real-Time Object Detection (RTOD) methods commonly adopt YOLO-like architectures for their favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed. However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed. Code will be available.

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition and behavior-based emotion prediction are both highly challenging tasks that require modeling subtle, fine-grained human behaviors, primarily leveraging video and skeletal pose data. In this work, we present two multimodal frameworks designed to tackle both problems on the iMiGUE dataset. For micro-gesture classification, we explore the complementary strengths of RGB and 3D pose-based representations to capture nuanced spatio-temporal patterns. To comprehensively represent gestures, video, and skeletal embeddings are extracted using MViTv2-S and 2s-AGCN, respectively. Then, they are integrated through a Cross-Modal Token Fusion module to combine spatial and pose information. For emotion recognition, our framework extends to behavior-based emotion prediction, a binary classification task identifying emotional states based on visual cues. We leverage facial and contextual embeddings extracted using SwinFace and MViTv2-S models and fuse them through an InterFusion module designed to capture emotional expressions and body gestures. Experiments conducted on the iMiGUE dataset, within the scope of the MiGA 2025 Challenge, demonstrate the robust performance and accuracy of our method in the behavior-based emotion prediction task, where our approach secured 2nd place.

Result: MedGemma-4b-it：基于LoRA微调的专用模型，在六类疾病分类任务上显示出优于GPT-4的性能，平均测试准确率80.37%，尤其在癌症和肺炎等关键任务上灵敏度更高。GPT-4（未经微调）平均准确率69.58%，存在较多假阴性/假阳性，提示领域微调对减少幻觉和提高临床可靠性至关重要。

Conclusion: 领域特化与微调（如LoRA）能显著提升多模态模型在医学影像诊断中的性能与安全性；开源专用模型在临床高风险任务中优于未微调的大型通用模型。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) introduce an emerging paradigm for medical imaging by interpreting scans through the lens of extensive clinical knowledge, offering a transformative approach to disease classification. This study presents a critical comparison between two fundamentally different AI architectures: the specialized open-source agent MedGemma and the proprietary large multimodal model GPT-4 for diagnosing six different diseases. The MedGemma-4b-it model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), demonstrated superior diagnostic capability by achieving a mean test accuracy of 80.37% compared to 69.58% for the untuned GPT-4. Furthermore, MedGemma exhibited notably higher sensitivity in high-stakes clinical tasks, such as cancer and pneumonia detection. Quantitative analysis via confusion matrices and classification reports provides comprehensive insights into model performance across all categories. These results emphasize that domain-specific fine-tuning is essential for minimizing hallucinations in clinical implementation, positioning MedGemma as a sophisticated tool for complex, evidence-based medical reasoning.

Conclusion: CME-CAD通过协同多专家强化学习训练范式，提升了CAD代码生成的精度与可编辑性，能生成满足约束的可执行CAD模型。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is essential in industrial design, but the complexity of traditional CAD modeling and workflows presents significant challenges for automating the generation of high-precision, editable CAD models. Existing methods that reconstruct 3D models from sketches often produce non-editable and approximate models that fall short of meeting the stringent requirements for precision and editability in industrial design. Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation. Our approach integrates the complementary strengths of these models, facilitating collaborative learning and improving the model's ability to generate accurate, constraint-compatible, and fully editable CAD models. We introduce a two-stage training process: Multi-Expert Fine-Tuning (MEFT), and Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (MERL). Additionally, we present CADExpert, an open-source benchmark consisting of 17,299 instances, including orthographic projections with precise dimension annotations, expert-generated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, executable CADQuery code, and rendered 3D models.

*Xiu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉表征应视为纤维丛结构：语义为商空间，需外部判别信息且模型需能做拓扑改变（先展开再塌缩）以实现语义抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为何视觉学习需要判别性或多模态监督并为何某些模型能获得抽象语义表示，提供拓扑学视角联系理论与经验现象。

Method: 从拓扑和结构视角出发，假设语义状态离散并结合可迁移性与抽象性前提，推导观测空间呈纤维丛结构；分析商空间的非子流形性质及语义抽象对模型结构的要求，提出“扩展-钩合”机制作为表征拓扑变化的示意。

Result: 提出视觉理解需要语义语言，观测空间呈纤维丛结构，语义为商空间，噪声在纤维上变化。得到两点理论后果：1) 语义商X/G不是X的子流形，需非同胚的判别性目标（标签等）来获得不变性；2) 模型需支持拓扑变化的表征机制，即“扩展-钩合”过程以实现语义抽象。框架解释性强，与大规模判别/多模态模型经验规律和统计学习理论一致。

Conclusion: 语义抽象不能仅靠平滑变形或无监督连续方法，需要判别性信号与可进行拓扑变换的表征机制；该拓扑框架解释了为何有监督、跨实例识别与多模态对齐在视觉学习中有效。

Abstract: We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.

Motivation: 现有自动计数方法在指定目标对象方式上受限，难以灵活描述要计数或排除的对象，且可视示例需手工标注，无法指定排除项。

Method: 扩展提示以包含“what not to count”，引入伪示例自动注释机制，允许输入外部自然和合成图像作为示例，并将改进后的CountGD++集成到LLM工作流作为视觉专家代理。

Conclusion: 这些贡献扩大了提示灵活性，提高了计数精度、效率和跨数据集泛化能力。

Abstract: The flexibility and accuracy of methods for automatically counting objects in images and videos are limited by the way the object can be specified. While existing methods allow users to describe the target object with text and visual examples, the visual examples must be manually annotated inside the image, and there is no way to specify what not to count. To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images. We also use our new counting model, CountGD++, as a vision expert agent for an LLM. Together, these contributions expand the prompt flexibility of multi-modal open-world counting and lead to significant improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and generalization across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: 通过可扩展的数据生成与注释流水线，以及混合几何编码器的VLM框架，作者提高了多视角空间推理的鲁棒性和现实场景适应性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for enhanced 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning. However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed dataset and VQA tasks effectively enhance spatial reasoning under challenging multi-view conditions, validating the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline in constructing realistic and diverse QA pairs. Code and dataset will be available soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-view correspondence learning needs better local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization to improve robustness and geometric constraint capture.

Method: Paper method analysis

Result: MGCA-Net with CGA and CSMGC modules outperforms SOTA on YFCC100M and SUN3D for outlier rejection and camera pose estimation; code available.

Conclusion: MGCA-Net addresses prior limitations and achieves strong performance gains on benchmarks.

Abstract: Two-view correspondence learning is a key task in computer vision, which aims to establish reliable matching relationships for applications such as camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, which make it difficult to accurately capture the geometric constraints of matched pairs and thus reduce the robustness of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net), which consists of a Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) module and a Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) module. Specifically, CGA dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via an adaptive attention mechanism and enhances the capability to capture both local and global geometric relationships. Meanwhile, CSMGC establishes geometric consensus via a cross-stage sparse graph network, ensuring the consistency of geometric information across different stages. Experimental results on two representative YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show that MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in the outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

Motivation: 随着便捷图像编辑模型的普及，生成式内容滥用风险上升，现有跨数据集评估掩盖了检测器在多样化 AIGC 场景下的脆弱性，因此需要更细粒度、更具挑战性的诊断基准来推动 IMDL 走向真正鲁棒。

Method: 构建大规模数据集并按四个轴（编辑模型、操作类型、语义内容、伪造粒度）对样本进行分层标注，设计五种跨维度评价协议并在 11 个代表性模型上做系统化实验与失效分析。

Result: NeXT-IMDL 提出了一个面向泛化边界诊断的大规模基准，归类编辑操控维度并设计五种跨维度评估协议，揭示现有检测器在真实多样化 AIGC 场景下的系统性失效与性能降级。

Conclusion: 当前主流 IMDL 方法在原始数据分布外表现脆弱，亟需通过更细致的诊断基准与训练策略来提升对多源、多样化 AIGC 操作的泛化能力。

Abstract: The accessibility surge and abuse risks of user-friendly image editing models have created an urgent need for generalizable, up-to-date methods for Image Manipulation Detection and Localization (IMDL). Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios. By providing this diagnostic toolkit and the new findings, we aim to advance the development towards building truly robust, next-generation IMDL models.

Motivation: 现有实时流式音频驱动头像系统在延迟和计算预算下通常需牺牲视觉保真或采用严格单向注意力，导致运动连贯性和细节不足。作者希望在不牺牲质量的前提下实现低延迟、高保真、无限时长生成。

Method: 1) 自纠正双向蒸馏：在视频块内保留双向注意力，通过蒸馏策略将双向信息高效迁移到实时模型中，同时引入自纠正机制减少单向限制带来的信息损失；2) 多步回顾自我修正：模型在生成过程中定期回顾最近帧并修正累计误差，防止生成崩溃；3) 推理加速套件：混合序列并行、Parallel VAE与内核级优化来降低延迟并提升吞吐。

Abstract: Deploying massive diffusion models for real-time, infinite-duration, audio-driven avatar generation presents a significant engineering challenge, primarily due to the conflict between computational load and strict latency constraints. Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.

TL;DR: 将无需微调的2D SAM语义通过残差门控注入到3D点云，并结合中心引导掩码修正与顺序感知匹配，提高了3D牙齿实例分割的边界精度和标签一致性，特别是第三磨牙。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是弥合2D强语义模型与3D几何方法的优缺点：利用2D边界感知语义补足3D方法在边界和少数类上的不足，同时保持临床工作流的可行性，不需对2D模型进行额外微调。

Method: 方法包括：1) 点级残差门控模块，将来自噬合面视角的SAM嵌入按需融合入3D点特征以增强边界信息；2) 中心引导的掩码精修，通过约束实例掩码与几何质心一致性来减少中心漂移；3) 顺序感知的匈牙利匹配，将牙位序列信息与中心距离结合到分配相似度中，改善缺失或拥挤情况下的标签分配。

Result: SOFTooth在3D牙齿实例分割上通过结合2D语义与3D几何信息取得了优势，特别是在第三磨牙等稀有类别上表现提升明显。作者提出了点级残差门控模块注入SAM的2D特征、基于中心引导的掩码精修以及顺序感知的匈牙利匹配策略。实验证明在3DTeethSeg'22数据集上实现了SOTA水平的整体准确率和mIoU。

Conclusion: SOFTooth证明了冻结的2D语义可以在不需2D掩码监督下有效提升3D实例分割，解决边界泄漏、中心漂移与类别不一致问题，并在有缺损或拥挤牙弓场景下保持标签连贯性。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) tooth instance segmentation remains challenging due to crowded arches, ambiguous tooth-gingiva boundaries, missing teeth, and rare yet clinically important third molars. Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前美学质量评估面临数据稀缺与不平衡以及模型碎片化问题；需要一个可扩展的多维描述数据集和一个能处理长文本的统一框架来更好对齐美学评估与人类认知。

Method: 1) 数据：通过迭代自动化流水线生成70k条多维结构化美学描述（避免昂贵人工标注）；2) 模型：ArtQuant使用联合生成策略耦合多维美学属性，采用大模型（LLM）解码器来建模长文本语义；3) 理论：分析数据语义充分性与生成范式对预测熵的影响；4) 实验：在多个数据集上验证性能与效率。

Result: The paper introduces RAD dataset and ArtQuant framework for aesthetic quality assessment of artistic images. RAD is a 70k multi-dimensional structured dataset generated with an iterative pipeline to overcome annotation costs and imbalance. ArtQuant couples aesthetic dimensions via joint description generation and uses LLM decoders to model long-text semantics, improving efficiency and performance. Theoretical analysis links RAD and generation paradigm to minimized prediction entropy. Experiments show SOTA and 33% fewer training epochs.

Conclusion: RAD数据集与ArtQuant模型协同工作，能更全面地表征艺术图像的美学要素并高效建模长文本语义，实验证明在多个数据集上达到了最优性能且训练成本更低，具有推动AIGC美学评估研究的潜力。

Abstract: The aesthetic quality assessment task is crucial for developing a human-aligned quantitative evaluation system for AIGC. However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment. We will release both code and dataset to support future research.

TL;DR: DriveLaW通过把视频生成器的隐表示直接用于扩散规划器，实现视频预测与轨迹规划的一体化训练，显著提升了预测质量和规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型在自动驾驶中通常将世界预测与运动规划视为分离过程，导致生成和规划间不一致，影响长尾场景的决策可靠性。DriveLaW旨在通过共享隐表示弥合二者间的鸿沟。

Method: DriveLaW由两个核心模块组成：DriveLaW-Video（生成高保真未来帧并输出富表达的隐表示）和DriveLaW-Act（基于扩散模型的规划器，从DriveLaW-Video的隐表示生成一致且可靠的轨迹），并采用三阶段渐进式训练策略对两部分联合优化。

Result: 在视频预测任务上，DriveLaW在FID上优于此前最优方法33.3%，在FVD上提升1.8%；在NAVSIM规划基准上取得新的最好成绩，表明统一范式在生成与规划两任务均带来显著增益。

Conclusion: DriveLaW提出了一种统一视频生成与运动规划的新范式，通过将视频生成器的隐变量直接注入规划器，实现高保真未来场景生成与可靠轨迹规划的一致性。

Abstract: World models have become crucial for autonomous driving, as they learn how scenarios evolve over time to address the long-tail challenges of the real world. However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DDSPO通过对比参考模型在正常/语义降级提示下的行为，直接在去噪时间步上生成稠密偏好监督，从而在不依赖人工标注的情况下改善文本-图像对齐与画质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于现有基于偏好的微调方法依赖昂贵且噪声大的人工偏好标注或对最终样本级别的监督信号，无法提供丰富的过渡级信息；通过直接在score/过渡级别施加偏好监督，可更精细地引导扩散模型在整个去噪过程中对齐用户意图并提升视觉质量，同时降低标注需求。

Method: 方法包括：(1) 利用已有生成模型作为参考，通过输入原始提示与语义降级提示，生成‘获胜’与‘失败’样本；(2) 在去噪轨迹的每个时间步计算并比较两者的score（或策略），得到过渡级别的偏好信号；(3) 使用这些稠密的score差异直接监督目标扩散模型的score网络，称为DDSPO；(4) 无需显示奖励建模或人工标注，全部通过自动化生成的偏好对构建训练样本。

Result: DDSPO (Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization)提出了一种从赢家/输家策略直接生成每个去噪步的监督信号的方法，避免了昂贵人工标注，通过预训练参考模型在原始提示与语义降级提示下的输出差异自动构建偏好标签，并在score space中进行监督。实验证明在文本-图像对齐和视觉质量上超越或匹配现有基于偏好的方法，同时显著减少监督成本。

Conclusion: DDSPO能在无需人工偏好标注的前提下，利用参考模型自动生成偏好信号，并将这些信号转化为逐步的score监督，提升模型在对齐性和视觉质量上的表现，同时降低监督开销。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generative tasks such as text-to-image synthesis, yet they often struggle to fully align outputs with nuanced user intent and maintain consistent aesthetic quality. Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision. Our implementation is available at: https://dohyun-as.github.io/DDSPO

Conclusion: uncertainty estimation can provide meaningful signals for segmentation errors and may aid domain-agnostic robustness; further work needed

Abstract: Foundation models for segmentation such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) family exhibit strong zero-shot performance, but remain vulnerable in shifted or limited-knowledge domains. This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step. Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal. While refinement benefits are preliminary, our findings underscore the potential of incorporating uncertainty into segmentation models to support robust, domain-agnostic performance. Our benchmark and code are made publicly available.

Abstract: Monitoring states of road surfaces provides valuable information for the planning and controlling vehicles and active vehicle control systems. Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic.

Abstract: We introduce RealX3D, a real-capture benchmark for multi-view visual restoration and 3D reconstruction under diverse physical degradations. RealX3D groups corruptions into four families, including illumination, scattering, occlusion, and blurring, and captures each at multiple severity levels using a unified acquisition protocol that yields pixel-aligned LQ/GT views. Each scene includes high-resolution capture, RAW images, and dense laser scans, from which we derive world-scale meshes and metric depth. Benchmarking a broad range of optimization-based and feed-forward methods shows substantial degradation in reconstruction quality under physical corruptions, underscoring the fragility of current multi-view pipelines in real-world challenging environments.

TL;DR: CoFi-Dec is a training-free, model-agnostic decoding framework reducing LVLM hallucinations by synthesizing multi-level visual conditions and fusing them via Wasserstein alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs hallucinate when generated outputs are not grounded in visual input; need a training-free method to improve grounding during decoding.

Method: Decoding-time hallucination mitigation with coarse-to-fine multi-visual grounding

Result: CoFi-Dec generates coarse and fine textual responses, converts them to images, creates multi-level visual hypotheses, and fuses their predictive distributions using a Wasserstein-based mechanism to produce more faithful outputs.

Conclusion: CoFi-Dec effectively reduces entity- and semantic-level hallucinations across benchmarks without extra training and can be applied to various LVLMs.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multi-modal understanding and generation. However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.

Abstract: Accurate and continuous monitoring of river water levels is essential for flood forecasting, water resource management, and ecological protection. Traditional hydrological observation methods are often limited by manual measurement errors and environmental constraints. This study presents a hybrid framework integrating vision based waterline detection, YOLOv8 pose scale extraction, and large multimodal language models (GPT 4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for automated river gauge plate reading. The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation. Overall, the proposed approach offers a scalable, efficient, and reliable solution for automated hydrological monitoring, demonstrating potential for real time river gauge digitization and improved water resource management.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a generative model for deterministic image-to-image translation that yields faithful, low-variance outputs closely matching ground truth, leveraging stochastic process theory (Brownian bridge) and dual neural approximators.

Method: Define a Brownian bridge-based stochastic differential process conditioned on both source and target; design two neural network approximators for forward and reverse transitions; train them (likely with denoising score matching / variational objectives) to minimize reconstruction error and variance; use deterministic sampling via the reverse approximator to produce consistent outputs.

Result: A denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge) that uses forward and reverse neural networks to achieve high-fidelity, low-variance outputs for I2I tasks, outperforming both stochastic and deterministic baselines on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution.

Conclusion: Dual-approx Bridge effectively combines Brownian bridge dynamics with dual neural approximators to produce deterministic-like, high-quality I2I translations with negligible variance and strong fidelity to ground truth, validated by experiments on benchmarks.

Abstract: Image-to-Image (I2I) translation involves converting an image from one domain to another. Deterministic I2I translation, such as in image super-resolution, extends this concept by guaranteeing that each input generates a consistent and predictable output, closely matching the ground truth (GT) with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Conclusion: MCI-Net通过多域上下文聚合与动态内点选择，显著提升点云配准的特征表达与配准性能。

Abstract: Robust and discriminative feature learning is critical for high-quality point cloud registration. However, existing deep learning-based methods typically rely on Euclidean neighborhood-based strategies for feature extraction, which struggle to effectively capture the implicit semantics and structural consistency in point clouds. To address these issues, we propose a multi-domain context integration network (MCI-Net) that improves feature representation and registration performance by aggregating contextual cues from diverse domains. Specifically, we propose a graph neighborhood aggregation module, which constructs a global graph to capture the overall structural relationships within point clouds. We then propose a progressive context interaction module to enhance feature discriminability by performing intra-domain feature decoupling and inter-domain context interaction. Finally, we design a dynamic inlier selection method that optimizes inlier weights using residual information from multiple iterations of pose estimation, thereby improving the accuracy and robustness of registration. Extensive experiments on indoor RGB-D and outdoor LiDAR datasets show that the proposed MCI-Net significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest registration recall of 96.4\% on 3DMatch.

Abstract: Recent research has focused on using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbones in two-view correspondence learning, demonstrating significant superiority over methods based on multilayer perceptrons. However, CNN backbones that are not tailored to specific tasks may fail to effectively aggregate global context and oversmooth dense motion fields in scenes with large disparity. To address these problems, we propose a novel network named SC-Net, which effectively integrates bilateral context from both spatial and channel perspectives. Specifically, we design an adaptive focused regularization module (AFR) to enhance the model's position-awareness and robustness against spurious motion samples, thereby facilitating the generation of a more accurate motion field. We then propose a bilateral field adjustment module (BFA) to refine the motion field by simultaneously modeling long-range relationships and facilitating interaction across spatial and channel dimensions. Finally, we recover the motion vectors from the refined field using a position-aware recovery module (PAR) that ensures consistency and precision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative pose estimation and outlier removal tasks on YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets.

Conclusion: TV-RAG通过结合时间衰减检索与基于熵的关键帧采样，在无需训练的前提下显著提升长视频理解与检索性能，能够作为对现有LVLM的轻量级升级方案。

Abstract: Large Video Language Models (LVLMs) have rapidly emerged as the focus of multimedia AI research. Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

Motivation: Existing context modeling methods ignore multi-order cross-scale interactions; need richer scene understanding by aggregating neighborhood relationships across scales

Method: Hierarchical cross-scale context aggregation in Hilbert space using random-walk attention

Result: Proposes PanCAN: learns multi-order neighborhoods per scale via random walks + attention; cascades modules across scales selecting salient anchors and fusing neighborhood features; shows improved multi-label classification on NUS-WIDE, VOC2007, MS-COCO

Conclusion: Cross-scale multi-order context aggregation via attention over random-walk neighborhoods enhances scene understanding and boosts multi-label classification performance

Abstract: Context modeling is crucial for visual recognition, enabling highly discriminative image representations by integrating both intrinsic and extrinsic relationships between objects and labels in images. A limitation in current approaches is their focus on basic geometric relationships or localized features, often neglecting cross-scale contextual interactions between objects. This paper introduces the Deep Panoptic Context Aggregation Network (PanCAN), a novel approach that hierarchically integrates multi-order geometric contexts through cross-scale feature aggregation in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. Specifically, PanCAN learns multi-order neighborhood relationships at each scale by combining random walks with an attention mechanism. Modules from different scales are cascaded, where salient anchors at a finer scale are selected and their neighborhood features are dynamically fused via attention. This enables effective cross-scale modeling that significantly enhances complex scene understanding by combining multi-order and cross-scale context-aware features. Extensive multi-label classification experiments on NUS-WIDE, PASCAL VOC2007, and MS-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that PanCAN consistently achieves competitive results, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, thereby substantially improving multi-label classification performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintain consistent human character identities across multi-image story generation where existing models struggle with detailed, diverse face consistency and multi-character coordination.

Method: Use Iterative Identity Discovery to find consistent character identity representations, then apply Re-denoising Identity Injection to re-denoise and inject identities into image generation while keeping contextual fidelity.

Result: IdentityStory framework with two components—Iterative Identity Discovery and Re-denoising Identity Injection—improves face consistency and multi-character composition; outperforms prior methods on ConsiStory-Human benchmark and supports long/complex stories.

Conclusion: IdentityStory effectively preserves and coordinates human identities across sequential images, enabling higher-quality multi-character stories and scalable applications like infinite-length generation.

Abstract: Recent visual generative models enable story generation with consistent characters from text, but human-centric story generation faces additional challenges, such as maintaining detailed and diverse human face consistency and coordinating multiple characters across different images. This paper presents IdentityStory, a framework for human-centric story generation that ensures consistent character identity across multiple sequential images. By taming identity-preserving generators, the framework features two key components: Iterative Identity Discovery, which extracts cohesive character identities, and Re-denoising Identity Injection, which re-denoises images to inject identities while preserving desired context. Experiments on the ConsiStory-Human benchmark demonstrate that IdentityStory outperforms existing methods, particularly in face consistency, and supports multi-character combinations. The framework also shows strong potential for applications such as infinite-length story generation and dynamic character composition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models for image super-resolution face a trade-off between perceptual high-frequency detail and low-frequency structural fidelity; existing inference-time scaling methods are suboptimal.

Method: Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering: combines iterative refinement (progressive correction of structural deviations) and frequency-aware particle fusion (adaptive integration of high-frequency perceptual and low-frequency structural cues) without additional training.

Result: Proposed IAFS: a training-free framework combining iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion to balance perceptual quality and structural fidelity. Iteratively corrects structural deviations and adaptively integrates high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information. Shows consistent improvements over existing methods across multiple diffusion SR models.

Conclusion: IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, offering better perceptual detail and structural accuracy than prior inference-time scaling approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become a leading paradigm for image super-resolution (SR), but existing methods struggle to guarantee both the high-frequency perceptual quality and the low-frequency structural fidelity of generated images. Although inference-time scaling can theoretically improve this trade-off by allocating more computation, existing strategies remain suboptimal: reward-driven particle optimization often causes perceptual over-smoothing, while optimal-path search tends to lose structural consistency. To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion. IAFS addresses the challenge of balancing perceptual quality and structural fidelity by progressively refining the generated image through iterative correction of structural deviations. Simultaneously, it ensures effective frequency fusion by adaptively integrating high-frequency perceptual cues with low-frequency structural information, allowing for a more accurate and balanced reconstruction across different image details. Extensive experiments across multiple diffusion-based SR models show that IAFS effectively resolves the perception-fidelity conflict, yielding consistently improved perceptual detail and structural accuracy, and outperforming existing inference-time scaling methods.

Abstract: Multi-subject customization aims to synthesize multiple user-specified subjects into a coherent image. To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints. However, existing methods still struggle to balance three critical objectives: text alignment, subject identity preservation, and layout control, while the reliance on additional training further limits their scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathFound brings evidence-seeking, agentic inference to computational pathology, iteratively acquiring information and refining diagnoses, leading to better accuracy and discovery of subtle pathological features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of static inference in pathological AI models by modeling evidence-seeking, iterative diagnostic workflows similar to human pathologists.

Method: Combine pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reinforcement-learning-trained reasoning agents to perform staged inference: initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking interactions (e.g., request more views/regions), and final decision.

Result: PathFound, an agentic multimodal model integrating vision foundation models, vision-language models, and RL-trained reasoning models, enabling proactive information acquisition and iterative diagnosis, improving diagnostic accuracy and achieving SOTA performance in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Evidence-seeking, agentic workflows improve computational pathology diagnosis; PathFound demonstrates state-of-the-art results and ability to identify subtle details.

Abstract: Recent pathological foundation models have substantially advanced visual representation learning and multimodal interaction. However, most models still rely on a static inference paradigm in which whole-slide images are processed once to produce predictions, without reassessment or targeted evidence acquisition under ambiguous diagnoses. This contrasts with clinical diagnostic workflows that refine hypotheses through repeated slide observations and further examination requests. We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology. Among these models, PathFound achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance across diverse clinical scenarios and demonstrates strong potential to discover subtle details, such as nuclear features and local invasions.

Result: 在五个数据集上的大量测试表明，PurifyGen在降低不安全内容生成方面优于现有方法，并与依赖训练的方法表现相当，且能泛化到未见提示词与模型。

Conclusion: PurifyGen在不需额外训练或修改模型权重的前提下，通过令牌级别的语义评分与双空间变换有效净化危险提示词，显著降低了不安全内容生成的概率，在多数据集测试中优于现有方法并与需训练的方法竞争。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models. Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current methods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes well with training-dependent approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MLLM在真实科研文献中对化学反应的理解能力，揭示其在视觉和逻辑推理方面的局限，为开发更可靠的自动化化学助手提供基准。

Method: 构建RxnBench包含两个任务：SF-QA（1,525个问题，305个反应图）和FD-QA（108篇文章），评估模型对图像、文本和表格的跨模态综合理解。

Result: RxnBench评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在化学反应理解上的性能，尤其是从科学PDF中解析反应图、表格与文本。结果显示：模型能够较好地提取显性文本信息，但在精确识别化学结构和复杂机制推理上存在显著不足。引入推理时（inference-time reasoning）的模型表现优于基础架构，但在全文问答任务上准确率均未超过50%。

Conclusion: 现有通用MLLM在化学反应理解的关键能力（结构识别与化学逻辑推理）上不足，需开发领域专用视觉编码器并增强推理能力，以推动自动化AI化学研究。

Abstract: The integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into chemistry promises to revolutionize scientific discovery, yet their ability to comprehend the dense, graphical language of reactions within authentic literature remains underexplored. Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\% accuracy on FD-QA. These findings underscore the urgent need for domain-specific visual encoders and stronger reasoning engines to advance autonomous AI chemists.

Motivation: 现有将CoT应用于理解任务取得进展，但在生成任务中的应用仍然稀少且依赖场景专用机制，缺乏通用性与可扩展性。作者希望构建一个通用的思维驱动视觉生成框架，使MLLM的推理能力能有效指导多种生成场景。

Method: 提出一个解耦架构：预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）负责根据用户意图生成分步、可执行的指令（CoT），Diffusion Transformer（DiT）负责根据这些指令生成高质量图像。并引入可分离的GRPO训练范式（SepGRPO），在MLLM与DiT之间交替进行强化学习，以支持跨数据集的联合训练。

Conclusion: ThinkGen通过将MLLM的Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理显式引入图像生成任务，实现了从理解到生成的思维驱动流程，解决了场景专用机制带来的泛化受限问题。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrates that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning enables systematic solutions to complex understanding tasks. However, its extension to generation tasks remains nascent and limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation. In this work, we present ThinkGen, the first think-driven visual generation framework that explicitly leverages MLLM's CoT reasoning in various generation scenarios. ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkGen achieves robust, state-of-the-art performance across multiple generation benchmarks. Code is available: https://github.com/jiaosiyuu/ThinkGen

TL;DR: Paper links PCA and Haar via circulant representation to build Haar-tSVD, a fast plug-and-play denoiser that uses t-SVD and Haar transform, adds adaptive noise estimation and optional deep network integration; competitive denoising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high demand for efficient and effective image denoising without learning local bases, leveraging global and local patch correlations.

Method: The paper establishes a theoretical link between PCA and Haar transform under circulant representation, and proposes a denoising algorithm called Haar-tSVD.

Result: Haar-tSVD is a one-step, parallelizable denoiser combining t-SVD projection and Haar transform, with adaptive noise estimation and integration with deep networks for severe noise; experiments show efficiency and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Haar-tSVD offers a computationally simple, fast, and robust denoising approach balancing speed and performance, enhanced by adaptive noise estimation and optional deep learning fusion.

Abstract: The proliferation of imaging devices and countless image data generated every day impose an increasingly high demand on efficient and effective image denoising. In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship. Experimental results on various denoising datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed method for noise removal.

Motivation: 现有防护方法多为被动且需要调整模型，难以应对不断出现的多模态OOD安全风险；因此需要一种无需改动基础模型即可主动识别并描述新兴安全风险的方案。

Method: 构建模态平衡的87K标注数据集；以强化学习训练视觉-语言基础模型；设计OOD安全类别推断任务；引入同义词库相似度奖励以鼓励对未见类别生成简洁描述。

Result: ProGuard提出了一种视觉-语言主动防护模型，用于识别和描述模态外（OOD）安全风险，无需对基础模型进行调整。作者构建了一个包含87K样本的模态平衡数据集，每个样本标注有二元安全标签和层次化多模态安全分类，缓解了模态偏差并保证跨文本、图像及文本-图像输入的一致审查。基于该数据集，通过强化学习训练视觉-语言基础模型以实现高效、简洁的推理；并在此基础上设计OOD安全类别推断任务，结合基于同义词库的相似度奖励以鼓励模型对未见不安全类别生成简明描述。实验表明：在二元安全分类上接近闭源大模型表现；在不安全内容分类上显著优于现有开源防护模型；在主动式OOD风险检测和描述上分别提升52.6%和64.8%。

Conclusion: ProGuard证明了无需修改基础模型即可通过训练一个视觉-语言守护模块，并结合OOD任务与同义词相似度奖励，有效提升多模态主动安全检测与描述能力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative models has led to a continuous emergence of multimodal safety risks, exposing the limitations of existing defense methods. To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出针对多模态（文本、图像、音频）条件的在线蒸馏改进方案，使扩散视频模型以自回归方式在保持质量的同时将推理成本和延迟降低约20倍，支持实时多轮人机交互的LiveTalk系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散视频模型双向并行迭代去噪导致高延迟，不利于实时多模态人机交互；已有蒸馏多集中于文本到视频，不能有效处理包含图像与音频的交互场景，且Self Forcing在多模态条件下出现视觉伪影与质量下降，需要改进。

Method: 基于对比Self Forcing的改进在线蒸馏配方，强调条件输入预处理/增强、优化初始化和训练调度，使模型变为自回归并减少采样步骤；结合Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks用于长视频推理，并与音频语言模型集成构建实时系统。

Conclusion: 通过优化条件输入质量、初始化和在线优化调度，所蒸馏模型在多个avatar视频数据集上达到与全步双向基线相当的视觉质量，同时将延迟从分钟级降至实时，并在多轮交互基准上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Real-time video generation via diffusion is essential for building general-purpose multimodal interactive AI systems. However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.

TL;DR: TWIN is a 561k image-pair dataset for training VLMs to discern whether two similar images show the same object; fine-tuning improves fine-grained recognition across domains and benchmarks


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs are coarse-grained and datasets emphasize general recognition; need to improve fine-grained perception

Method: Fine-tuning VLMs on a new dataset

Result: Fine-tuning on TWIN improves fine-grained recognition on unseen domains and boosts FGVQA performance up to 19.3% without harming general VQA performance

Conclusion: TWIN scales well with object annotations; scale is key; can be added to VLM training corpora to improve perceptual precision

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition ("Is it a cat or a dog?") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models. Project webpage: https://glab-caltech.github.io/twin/

Abstract: Improving the accuracy of fire detection using infrared night vision cameras remains a challenging task. Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.
  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0. The proposed approach achieves higher detection accuracy compared to previous methods, particularly for night-time fire detection. Third, to improve fire detection in RGB images, especially for small and distant objects, we introduce Patched-YOLO, which enhances the model's detection capability through patch-based processing. Further details of these contributions are discussed in the following sections.

Conclusion: SRFA框架在该研究的数据与实验设置下显著提升了胰腺肿瘤检测性能，具有潜在的临床辅助价值，但尚需在更大、外部多中心数据上验证泛化性和可解释性。

Abstract: The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.

Motivation: Quantify memorization in 3D generative models to prevent data leakage and improve diversity

Method: Evaluation framework + controlled experiments

Result: Memorization depends on data modality, increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; peaks at moderate guidance scale; mitigated by longer Vecsets and rotation augmentation

Conclusion: 提供经验性理解并建议简单有效的减缓策略，代码公开

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used in 3D vision to synthesize novel shapes, yet it remains unclear whether their generation relies on memorizing training shapes. Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the influence of different data and modeling designs on memorization. We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力的时序对齐往往弱化显式运动建模，且使用统一运动假设（恒定速度等）与偏向语义特征的隐式对齐在类别与帧间运动变化下效果欠佳，需一种自适应的显式-隐式结合对齐机制。

Method: HAT先用若干显式运动模型（如不同物理假设）生成历史实例的空间锚点与运动感知特征候选，然后在缓存的对象查询中融合语义与运动线索，进行多假设解码，自动选择最优对齐提议用于目标帧预测。

Result: 在nuScenes上，HAT在多种基线的3D时序检测与跟踪上均有稳定提升。与DETR3D配合时，在测试集上达到了46.0% AMOTA的最先进跟踪结果；在端到端以对象为中心的方法中，感知精度提升+1.3% mAP、+3.1% AMOTA，碰撞率下降32%。在nuScenes-C（语义污染）情形下，HAT增强的运动建模使感知与规划更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 本文提出的HAT模块通过多假设显式运动模型与语义-运动解码机制，显著提升了时序对齐性能，从而改善了端到端自动驾驶的感知与跟踪性能，尤其在语义受损情况下仍能保持鲁棒性。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.

*Keda Tao,Wenjie Du,Bohan Yu,Weiqiang Wang,Jian Liu,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OmniAgent，一种音频引导的主动感知代理，通过动态调用专用工具并采用粗到细的音频引导感知范式，实现更细粒度的视听推理与对齐。相比静态流水线方法，OmniAgent在三项音视频基准测试上提升10%-20%精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全模态大模型在细粒度跨模态理解和多模态对齐上表现不足，且多依赖静态、密集的帧-字幕生成；因此需要一种主动、音频驱动的策略来更高效地集中注意力并提高对齐精度。

Method: 提出主动感知代理架构，使用动态规划器在任务相关时刻调用专用工具；引入粗到细的音频引导感知流程，先用音频定位时间事件，再触发视觉或高级推理工具。

Result: 在三个音视频理解基准上，OmniAgent比现有开源和专有模型提高了约10%-20%的准确率，表明其在细粒度对齐与推理方面的显著优势。

Conclusion: OmniAgent通过音频引导的主动感知和动态规划工具调用，显著提升了音视频理解的精细对齐和推理能力，在多个基准上取得了SOTA级别的改进。

Abstract: Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often lack the fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.

*Kang Du,Yirui Guan,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IDT，一种基于Transformer的前馈多视角内在图像分解方法，显式因子化为漫反射反照率、漫反射阴影和镜面阴影，能在单次前向传播中生成视图一致的分解结果，性能优于先前方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: single-view diffusion methods yield view inconsistency when extended to multi-view; need joint reasoning for consistency and efficiency without iterative sampling

Method: feed-forward transformer-based multi-view intrinsic decomposition

Result: produces view-consistent diffuse reflectance, coherent diffuse shading, and isolated specular components; better multi-view consistency than prior methods on synthetic and real datasets

Conclusion: IDT通过物理约束的分解与多视图注意力联合推理，在准确性、可解释性及视图一致性方面显著提升多视角内在分解性能

Abstract: Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者用合成透明场景数据集+视频扩散模型的先验，通过轻量LoRA在DiT骨干中联合训练RGB与深度潜码，得到D K T模型，实现对透明/反射物体的鲁棒、时序一致深度/法线估计，零样本SOTA并提升抓取成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有感知手段在透明/反射物体上失败，但视频扩散模型能合成真实透明现象，推测其内含光学规律，因而可用作无标签视频感知先验以改善深度估计。

Method: 构建11k合成视频数据集TransPhy3D（Blender/Cycles渲染RGB/depth/normals），在大规模视频扩散模型上加入LoRA适配器，训练视频到视频的深度/法线翻译器，训练时把RGB与噪深度潜码拼接进DiT骨干并联合训练合成与现有帧级数据，得到可处理任意长度视频的预测器。

Result: Paper builds TransPhy3D synthetic dataset and trains a video-to-video translator (DKT) using video diffusion model and LoRA to predict depth and normals for transparent objects, achieving zero-shot SOTA and improving grasping success.

Conclusion: 视频扩散模型确实内化了透明物理规则，且可通过高效、无标签方式改造为时序一致且适用于真实世界的深度/法线估计器，改善机器人操作表现。

Abstract: Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: "Diffusion knows transparency." Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Stream-DiffVSR，一种仅基于过去帧的因果扩散视频超分辨率方法，通过四步蒸馏去噪器、自动回归时序引导(ARTG)和时间感知解码器(含TPM)实现低延迟在线VSR。720p帧在RTX4090上0.328s/帧，感知质量超越先前扩散方法并比在线SOTA显著降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散VSR对延迟敏感且依赖未来帧与多步去噪，难以在线实时部署。为此提出一个仅依赖过去帧且采样步骤极少的扩散框架以满足低延迟需求。

Method: 关键技术包含：1) 四步蒸馏去噪器以减少采样步数；2) Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG)，在潜在去噪过程中注入基于运动对齐的时间线索；3) 轻量时间感知解码器，内置Temporal Processor Module (TPM)以增强细节和时间一致性。仅使用过去帧进行因果处理。

Result: 在RTX4090上处理720p帧耗时0.328s，感知指标LPIPS比在线SOTA TMP提高0.095，延迟比之前的扩散方法降低超过130倍，将初始延迟从>4600s降至0.328s。

Conclusion: Stream-DiffVSR是首个适用于低延迟在线部署的扩散式VSR，显著降低延迟并提升感知质量，达到在RTX4090上0.328s/帧的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods achieve strong perceptual quality but remain impractical for latency-sensitive settings due to reliance on future frames and expensive multi-step denoising. We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

TL;DR: 提出MonoM度量与单调性训练框架（生成可比较查询的工作负载+正则项），在保持或提升估计精度的同时显著降低违反单调性的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learned cardinality estimators can be more accurate than traditional methods but often violate logical constraints such as monotonicity, hindering production adoption.

Method: 分析MSCN如何违反单调性，设计能够生成严格可比较查询的工作负载生成器，并在损失函数中加入新的单调性正则项进行训练；用MonoM评价并用实验验证效果。

Result: Propose MonoM metric to quantify monotonicity adherence, and a monotonic training framework with workload generator and regularization to enforce monotonicity; shows improved monotonicity and accuracy for MSCN.

Conclusion: 单调性正则化不仅提升了模型对单调性的遵守，还通过缓解过拟合提高了基数估计的总体准确性，使学习型估计器更具生产可用性。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a key component of database query optimization. Recent studies have demonstrated that learned cardinality estimation techniques can surpass traditional methods in accuracy. However, a significant barrier to their adoption in production systems is their tendency to violate fundamental logical principles such as monotonicity. In this paper, we explore how learned models specifically MSCN, a query driven deep learning algorithm can breach monotonicity constraints. To address this, we propose a metric called MonoM, which quantitatively measures how well a cardinality estimator adheres to monotonicity across a given query workload. We also propose a monotonic training framework which includes a workload generator that produces directly comparable queries (one query's predicates are strictly more relaxed than another's, enabling monotonicity inference without actual execution) and a novel regularization term added to the loss function. Experimental results show that our monotonic training algorithm not only enhances monotonicity adherence but also improves cardinality estimation accuracy. This improvement is attributed to the regularization term, which reduces overfitting and improves model generalization.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了LLM生成SQL在云数据仓库上的成本，发现推理模型在保持相同正确率下处理字节少44.5%，执行时间与成本相关性弱（r=0.16），不同模型成本差异高达3.4倍，并识别了常见低效模式与部署建议


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现有效率指标不能反映云数据仓库按使用量计费的真实成本，提出基于成本的系统评估

Method: 在Google BigQuery上使用StackOverflow(230GB)数据集，选取6个SOTA LLM，执行180次查询并记录每次处理字节、插槽使用和估算费用，分析正确率、成本相关性及低效查询模式

Result: 在Google BigQuery上对6个最先进LLM执行180条SQL查询，使用StackOverflow数据集量化处理字节数、插槽利用率和估算费用；得出三个关键发现

Conclusion: 针对企业部署，推荐采用推理模型、监控字节处理与分区过滤，优化成本敏感场景并警惕标准模型产生的高成本查询

Abstract: Text-to-SQL systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, yet existing efficiency metrics such as the Valid Efficiency Score (VES) measure execution time rather than the consumption-based costs of cloud data warehouses. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of cloud compute costs for LLM-generated SQL queries. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across 180 query executions on Google BigQuery using the StackOverflow dataset (230GB), measuring bytes processed, slot utilization, and estimated cost. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) reasoning models process 44.5% fewer bytes than standard models while maintaining equivalent correctness (96.7%-100%); (2) execution time correlates weakly with query cost (r=0.16), indicating that speed optimization does not imply cost optimization; and (3) models exhibit up to 3.4x cost variance, with standard models producing outliers exceeding 36GB per query. We identify prevalent inefficiency patterns including missing partition filters and unnecessary full-table scans, and provide deployment guidelines for cost-sensitive enterprise environments.

TL;DR: 使用LoRA对提示增强的数据进行参数高效微调，可在多种提示模板下稳定提升列类型标注性能，降低训练参数量并提高加权F1。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CTA methods either require costly re-training for distribution shifts or are sensitive to prompt wording when using LLMs; need robust, adaptable solution with lower compute.

Method: Parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning with prompt augmentation for CTA

Result: LoRA fine-tuning on prompt-augmented data reduces sensitivity to prompt variations, requires far fewer trainable parameters, and improves weighted F1 stability and performance across datasets compared to single-template fine-tuning or prompting-only approaches.

Conclusion: 参数高效的LoRA微调结合提示增强是构建实用、鲁棒的列类型标注系统的有效方法。

Abstract: Column Type Annotation (CTA) is a fundamental step towards enabling schema alignment and semantic understanding of tabular data. Existing encoder-only language models achieve high accuracy when fine-tuned on labeled columns, but their applicability is limited to in-domain settings, as distribution shifts in tables or label spaces require costly re-training from scratch. Recent work has explored prompting generative large language models (LLMs) by framing CTA as a multiple-choice task, but these approaches face two key challenges: (1) model performance is highly sensitive to subtle changes in prompt wording and structure, and (2) annotation F1 scores remain modest. A natural extension is to fine-tune large language models. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs due to their scale, and the sensitivity to prompts is not eliminated. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient framework for CTA that trains models over prompt-augmented data via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach mitigates sensitivity to prompt variations while drastically reducing the number of necessary trainable parameters, achieving robust performance across datasets and templates. Experimental results on recent benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our prompt augmentation strategy maintain stable performance across diverse prompt patterns during inference and yield higher weighted F1 scores than those fine-tuned on a single prompt template. These results highlight the effectiveness of parameter-efficient training and augmentation strategies in developing practical and adaptable CTA systems.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文提出OrchANN，一种用于SSD上的大规模近似最近邻搜索（ANNS）的引导式I/O编排引擎，通过异构局部索引、查询感知导航图和多级几何剪枝，在I/O受限和语义嵌入分布倾斜条件下显著提升QPS与延迟并减少SSD访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在十亿级规模的out-of-core ANNS中，I/O成为性能瓶颈；现有系统在语义嵌入分布不均时表现差：统一局部索引与簇尺度不匹配，静态路由导致探测簇数膨胀，且现有剪枝在簇/向量层不充分，造成大量无效SSD读取。

Method: OrchANN通过三大技术：1) 离线自动探测为每个簇选择异构局部索引（匹配簇尺度）；2) 在内存维护查询感知的导航图以适应负载倾斜并减少错误路由；3) 使用带几何界的多级剪枝在发起SSD读之前过滤簇和向量，从而降低fetch-to-discard现象并减少I/O。

Result: 在严格out-of-core设置下的五个标准数据集上，OrchANN在保持精度的同时，降低SSD访问、提高QPS并缩短延迟，相较四个基线系统实现最多17.2× QPS提升与25.0×延迟降低。

Conclusion: OrchANN在五个标准数据集及严格出盘约束下，相比DiskANN、Starling、SPANN和PipeANN，在QPS和延迟上均显著优于这些基线，最多带来17.2倍QPS提升和25.0倍延迟降低，同时未牺牲准确率，并减少SSD访问次数。

Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) at billion scale is fundamentally an out-of-core problem: vectors and indexes live on SSD, so performance is dominated by I/O rather than compute. Under skewed semantic embeddings, existing out-of-core systems break down: a uniform local index mismatches cluster scales, static routing misguides queries and inflates the number of probed partitions, and pruning is incomplete at the cluster level and lossy at the vector level, triggering "fetch-to-discard" reranking on raw vectors.
  We present OrchANN, an out-of-core ANNS engine that uses an I/O orchestration model for unified I/O governance along the route-access-verify pipeline. OrchANN selects a heterogeneous local index per cluster via offline auto-profiling, maintains a query-aware in-memory navigation graph that adapts to skewed workloads, and applies multi-level pruning with geometric bounds to filter both clusters and vectors before issuing SSD reads. Across five standard datasets under strict out-of-core constraints, OrchANN outperforms four baselines including DiskANN, Starling, SPANN, and PipeANN in both QPS and latency while reducing SSD accesses. Furthermore, OrchANN delivers up to 17.2x higher QPS and 25.0x lower latency than competing systems without sacrificing accuracy.

Motivation: Handle route planning with scheduled buses and varying waiting/travel times for visiting a set of POIs from a start stop

Method: EA-Star on modified time-expanded bus graph

Result: Proposed modified graph structure; brute-force Dijkstra-like baseline; EA-Star algorithm that enumerates promising POI sequences and uses A* on modified graph with early termination; tested on NY bus data showing effectiveness

Conclusion: EA-Star在考虑动态到达时间与等待的公交网络下能有效找到访问所有指定POI的最短时间路线，显著优于暴力方案。

Abstract: This work addresses a route planning problem constrained by a bus road network that includes the schedules of all buses. Given a query with a starting bus stop and a set of Points of Interest (POIs) to visit, our goal is to find an optimal route on the bus network that allows the user to visit all specified POIs from the starting stop with minimal travel time, which includes both bus travel time and waiting time at bus stops. Although this problem resembles a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem, it cannot be effectively solved using existing solutions due to the complex nature of bus networks, particularly the constantly changing bus travel times and user waiting times. In this paper, we first propose a modified graph structure to represent the bus network, accommodating the varying bus travel times and their arrival schedules at each stop. Initially, we suggest a brute-force exploration algorithm based on the Dijkstra principle to evaluate all potential routes and determine the best one; however, this approach is too costly for large bus networks. To address this, we introduce the EA-Star algorithm, which focuses on computing the shortest route for promising POI visit sequences. The algorithm includes a terminal condition that halts evaluation once the optimal route is identified, avoiding the need to evaluate all possible POI sequences. During the computation of the shortest route for each POI visiting sequence, it employs the A* algorithm on the modified graph structure, narrowing the search space toward the destination and improving search efficiency. Experiments using New York bus network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Buffer management remains a critical component of database and operating system performance, serving as the primary mechanism for bridging the persistent latency gap between CPU processing speeds and storage access times. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of buffer management evolution spanning four decades of research. We systematically analyze the progression from foundational algorithms like LRU-K, 2Q, LIRS, and ARC to contemporary machine learning-augmented policies and disaggregated memory architectures. Our survey examines the historical OS-DBMS architectural divergence, production system implementations in PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Linux, and emerging trends including eBPF-based kernel extensibility, NVM-aware tiering strategies, and RDMA-enabled memory disaggregation. Through analysis of over 50 seminal papers from leading conferences (SIGMOD, VLDB, OSDI, FAST), we identify key architectural patterns, performance trade-offs, and open research challenges. We conclude by outlining a research direction that integrates machine learning with kernel extensibility mechanisms to enable adaptive, cross-layer buffer management for heterogeneous memory hierarchies in modern database systems.

Abstract: With the proliferation of temporal graph data, there is a growing demand for analyzing information propagation patterns during graph evolution. Existing graph analysis systems, mostly based on static snapshots, struggle to effectively capture information flows along the temporal dimension. To address this challenge, we introduce ChronoConnect, a novel system that enables tracking temporal pathways in temporal graph, especially beneficial to downstream mining tasks, e.g., understanding what are the critical pathways in propagating information towards a specific group of vertices. Built on ChronoConnect, users can conveniently configure and execute a variety of temporal traversal algorithms to efficiently analyze information diffusion processes under time constraints. Moreover, ChronoConnect utilizes parallel processing to tackle the explosive size-growth of evolving graphs. We showcase the effectiveness and enhanced performance of ChronoConnect through the implementation of algorithms that track pathways along highly dynamic vertices in temporal graphs. Furthermore, we offer an interactive user interface for graph visualization and query result exploration. We envision ChronoConnect to become a powerful tool for users to examine how information spreads over a temporal graph.

Conclusion: BRkNN-Light能有效共享多查询间的重复计算，利用快速验证、剪枝和距离缓存，在真实路网上表现优于现有方法，适合批量RkNN场景。

Abstract: The Reverse $k$-Nearest Neighbor (R$k$NN) query over moving objects on road networks seeks to find all moving objects that consider the specified query point as one of their $k$ nearest neighbors. In location based services, many users probably submit R$k$NN queries simultaneously. However, existing methods largely overlook how to efficiently process multiple such queries together, missing opportunities to share redundant computations and thus reduce overall processing costs. To address this, this work is the first to explore batch processing of multiple R$k$NN queries, aiming to minimize total computation by sharing duplicate calculations across queries. To tackle this issue, we propose the BR$k$NN-Light algorithm, which uses rapid verification and pruning strategies based on geometric constraints, along with an optimized range search technique, to speed up the process of identifying the R$k$NNs for each query. Furthermore, it proposes a dynamic distance caching mechanism to enable computation reuse when handling multiple queries, thereby significantly reducing unnecessary computations. Experiments on multiple real-world road networks demonstrate the superiority of the BR$k$NN-Light algorithm on the processing of batch queries.

LLMs provide generally reasonable suggestions, but often fail to generate optimal plans that account for detailed user requirements, given the vast number of potential POIs and possible routes based on POI combinations within a real-world road network. In this case, a route-planning API could serve as an external tool, accepting a sequence of keywords and returning the top-$k$ best routes tailored to user requests. To address this need, this paper introduces the Keyword-Aware Top-$k$ Routes (KATR) query that provides a more flexible and comprehensive semantic to route planning that caters to various user's preferences including flexible POI visiting order, flexible travel distance budget, and personalized POI ratings. Subsequently, we propose an explore-and-bound paradigm to efficiently process KATR queries by eliminating redundant candidates based on estimated score bounds from global to local levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach's superior performance over existing methods across different scenarios.

TL;DR: 将边值递增约束编译入图结构，既恢复核心GQL的表达能力，又在Neo4j Cypher中带来明显的性能提升并减少超时。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已有工作证明核心GQL无法检查路径中边值递增性，带来了表达能力的缺口。本工作旨在通过编译技巧恢复该能力并探索其实际性能影响。

Method: 提出一种构造性翻译：将递增边值的约束通过在输入图上增加结构或标注来编码，使得标准的核心GQL模式匹配能识别该约束；在Neo4j Cypher中实现该编译过程并评估性能。

Result: 构造性翻译成功恢复了表达性；在Neo4j Cypher原型中，与直接表达路径约束的做法相比，编译后查询更快且更稳定，避免了超时问题，显示出理论方法的实用收益。

Conclusion: 本文通过将“沿路径边值递增”条件编译入输入图，弥补了核心GQL模式匹配对该约束的表达能力缺失，并在Neo4j Cypher中实现了原型，既恢复了表达性，又能显著提升查询性能，避免超时。

Abstract: Pattern matching of core GQL, the new ISO standard for querying property graphs, cannot check whether edge values are increasing along a path, as established in recent work. We present a constructive translation that overcomes this limitation by compiling the increasing-edges condition into the input graph. Remarkably, the benefit of this construction goes beyond restoring expressiveness. In our proof-of-concept implementation in Neo4j's Cypher, where such path constraints are expressible but costly, our compiled version runs faster and avoids timeouts. This illustrates how a theoretically motivated translation can not only close an expressiveness gap but also bring practical performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reachability notions and indexing techniques for graphs don't capture groupwise interactions in hypergraphs; need efficient max-s reachability queries

Method: Introduce HL-index and fast covering detection

Result: Proposed HL-index (vertex-to-hyperedge) with fast covering relationship detection and neighbor-index; shows efficiency and scalability on 20 datasets

Conclusion: HL-index与附加优化能高效回答超图的最大可达性查询，并在多数据集上展现出良好性能

Abstract: Reachability in hypergraphs is essential for modeling complex groupwise interactions in real-world applications such as co-authorship, social network, and biological analysis, where relationships go beyond pairwise interactions. In this paper, we introduce the notion of s-reachability, where two vertices are s-reachable if there exists a sequence of hyperedges (i.e., a walk) connecting them, such that each pair of consecutive hyperedges shares at least s vertices. Moreover, we define the max-reachability query as a generalized form of the s-reachability problem, which aims to find the largest value of s that allows one vertex to reach another. To answer max-reachability queries in hypergraphs, we first analyze limitations of the existing vertex-to-vertex and hyperedge-to-hyperedge indexing techniques. We then introduce the HL-index, a compact vertex-to-hyperedge index tailored for the max-reachability problem. To both efficiently and effectively construct a minimal HL-index, we develop a fast covering relationship detection method to eliminate fruitless hypergraph traversals during index construction. A lightweight neighbor-index is further proposed to avoid repeatedly exploring neighbor relationships in hypergraphs and hence accelerate the construction. Extensive experiments on 20 datasets demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of our approach.

Motivation: 当前Text-to-SQL系统受限于高质量训练数据稀缺和模型在复杂场景中推理能力不足，需从数据与模型两端解决这两个瓶颈。

Method: 方法包括两部分：1) 数据层面：构建一个迭代的数据工厂，生成适合强化学习的高质量合成数据，采用严格验证机制保证正确性与语义-逻辑对齐；2) 模型层面：提出Agentic强化学习框架，包含Diversity-Aware Cold Start用于初始化稳健策略，以及Group Relative Policy Optimization(GRPO)用于通过环境反馈精炼推理能力。

Conclusion: 该论文通过数据和模型两方面的协同改进，提升了Text-to-SQL系统在复杂推理场景下的性能，最终在BIRD和Spider基准上取得了单模型方法的最优结果。

Abstract: The advancement of Text-to-SQL systems is currently hindered by the scarcity of high-quality training data and the limited reasoning capabilities of models in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework that addresses these issues through a dual-centric approach. From a Data-Centric perspective, we construct an iterative data factory that synthesizes RL-ready data characterized by high correctness and precise semantic-logic alignment, ensured by strict verification. From a Model-Centric perspective, we introduce a novel Agentic Reinforcement Learning framework. This framework employs a Diversity-Aware Cold Start stage to initialize a robust policy, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine the agent's reasoning via environmental feedback. Extensive experiments on BIRD and Spider benchmarks demonstrate that our synergistic approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among single-model methods.

*Mingjin Tao,Kailin Jiao,Yawen Li,Wei Liu,Ziqiang Yu*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: This paper studies kNN queries on dynamic road networks with changing travel costs, proposing DkNN, a distributed, index-free method using incremental network expansion and parallel Dijkstra on sub-networks to locate k nearest neighbors efficiently; implemented on Storm, it outperforms traditional index-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Index-based kNN methods fail in dynamic road networks because travel costs change rapidly, making indexes stale. Need an index-free, efficient approach that handles evolving costs and finds accurate kNNs.

Method: Abandon indexes; use incremental network expansion per snapshot. Partition the road network into sub-networks; run parallel Dijkstra searches in relevant partitions; coordinate to ensure global distance accuracy and early termination; implemented on Storm.

Result: Implemented DkNN on Storm and tested on real-world road networks, showing superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to traditional methods.

Conclusion: DkNN effectively finds kNNs in dynamic cost-changing road networks by partitioning the network and performing parallel, localized Dijkstra expansions, maintaining global distance accuracy, reducing unnecessary searches, enabling early detection of true kNNs, and outperforming traditional methods in experiments.

Abstract: The k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query over moving objects on road networks is essential for location-based services. Recently, this problem has been studied under road networks with distance as the metric, overlooking fluctuating travel costs. We pioneer the study of the kNN problem within dynamic road networks that account for evolving travel costs. Recognizing the limitations of index-based methods, which become quickly outdated as travel costs change, our work abandons indexes in favor of incremental network expansion on each snapshot of a dynamic road network to search for kNNs. To enhance expansion efficiency, we present DkNN, a distributed algorithm that divides the road network into sub-networks for parallel exploration using Dijkstra's algorithm across relevant regions. This approach effectively addresses challenges related to maintaining global distance accuracy during local, independent subgraph exploration, while minimizing unnecessary searches in irrelevant sub-networks and facilitating the early detection of true kNNs, despite the lack of constant global search monitoring. Implemented on the Storm platform, DkNN demonstrates superior efficiency and effectiveness over traditional methods in real-world road network scenarios.

TL;DR: 将优先级从排序变为采样，SPER用随机双边最大化实现线性时间高效候选筛选，在速度上显著优于现有方法且保持效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据/高速度场景下，传统渐进式ER依赖确定性排序来优先化候选对，导致超线性复杂度和高初始化开销，无法应对高速流和有限计算预算下的召回最大化需求。

Method: 提出Stochastic Progressive ER (SPER)框架：用连续随机双边最大化替换全局排序，把优先选取高价值候选对的问题看作概率高通滤波，采用线性时间采样策略维护高-效用对。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上的大量实验表明，SPER在保持相当召回率和精确率的同时，相较于最先进基线获得3x到6x的速度提升。

Conclusion: SPER通过将优先级问题从排序（ranking）转化为采样（sampling），在严格线性时间内实现高效候选对筛选，从而突破传统渐进式实体解析在高速度数据流上的可扩展性瓶颈。

Abstract: Entity Resolution (ER) is a critical data cleaning task for identifying records that refer to the same real-world entity. In the era of Big Data, traditional batch ER is often infeasible due to volume and velocity constraints, necessitating Progressive ER methods that maximize recall within a limited computational budget. However, existing progressive approaches fail to scale to high-velocity streams because they rely on deterministic sorting to prioritize candidate pairs, a process that incurs prohibitive super-linear complexity and heavy initialization costs. To address this scalability wall, we introduce SPER (Stochastic Progressive ER), a novel framework that redefines prioritization as a sampling problem rather than a ranking problem. By replacing global sorting with a continuous stochastic bipartite maximization strategy, SPER acts as a probabilistic high-pass filter that selects high-utility pairs in strictly linear time. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that SPER achieves significant speedups (3x to 6x) over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable recall and precision.
