While moving object scenarios have long been researched in the context of spatio-temporal data management, reactive behavior is usually left to complex end-user implementations. However, it is not just a matter of hardwiring reactive constraints: the required solutions need to satisfy tight low-latency computation requirements and be scalable. This paper explores a novel approach to enrich a distributed actor-based framework with reactive functionality and complex spatial data management along with concurrency semantics. Our approach relies on a proposal of the moving actor abstraction, which is a conceptual enhancement of the actor model with reactive sensing, movement, and spatial querying capabilities. This enhancement helps developers of reactive moving object applications avoid the significant burden of implementing application-level schemes to balance performance and consistency. Based on moving actors, we define a reactive moving object data management platform, named Moving Actor-Oriented Databases (M-AODBs), and build Dolphin -- an implementation of M-AODBs. Dolphin embodies a non-intrusive actor-based design layered on top of the Microsoft Orleans distributed virtual actor framework. In a set of experimental evaluations with realistic reactive moving object scenarios, Dolphin exhibits scalability on multi-machines and provides near-real-time reaction latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5e76\u53d1\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u57fa\u4e8eactor\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u79fb\u52a8actor\u201d\u62bd\u8c61\uff08\u5305\u542b\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faM-AODBs\u5e73\u53f0\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edfDolphin\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eMicrosoft Orleans\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u539f\u751f\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u884c\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u9700\u81ea\u884c\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6848\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e76\u53d1\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u79fb\u52a8actor\u62bd\u8c61\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49M-AODBs\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Orleans\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0Dolphin\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u673a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7528\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aDolphin\u5728\u591a\u673a\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8actor\u53caM-AODBs\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79fb\u52a8actor\u62bd\u8c61\u53ca\u5176\u5728M-AODBs/Dolphin\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5f00\u53d1\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, many existing approaches primarily focus on feature space consistency and classification personalization during local training, often neglecting the local adaptability of the extractor and the global generalization of the classifier. This oversight results in insufficient coordination and weak coupling between the components, ultimately degrading the overall model performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedeCouple, a federated learning method that balances global generalization and local adaptability at a fine-grained level. Our approach jointly learns global and local feature representations while employing dynamic knowledge distillation to enhance the generalization of personalized classifiers. We further introduce anchors to refine the feature space; their strict locality and non-transmission inherently preserve privacy and reduce communication overhead. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis proving that FedeCouple converges for nonconvex objectives, with iterates approaching a stationary point as the number of communication rounds increases. Extensive experiments conducted on five image-classification datasets demonstrate that FedeCouple consistently outperforms nine baseline methods in effectiveness, stability, scalability, and security.

Computer vision could greatly aid this research, but existing methods often rely on human-centric pretrained models and focus on single datasets, which limits generalization. We address this limitation by shifting from a model-centric to a data-centric approach and introduce PriVi, a large-scale primate-centric video pretraining dataset. PriVi contains 424 hours of curated video, combining 174 hours from behavioral research across 11 settings with 250 hours of diverse web-sourced footage, assembled through a scalable data curation pipeline. We pretrain V-JEPA on PriVi to learn primate-specific representations and evaluate it using a lightweight frozen classifier. Across four benchmark datasets, ChimpACT, BaboonLand, PanAf500, and ChimpBehave, our approach consistently outperforms prior work, including fully finetuned baselines, and scales favorably with fewer labels. These results demonstrate that primate-centric pretraining substantially improves data efficiency and generalization, making it a promising approach for low-label applications.

It occurs on a continuum from mild to severe, and treatment options can vary based on severity. Assessment of severity involves a clinician's expert judgment, which is costly and can vary widely in reliability. In this work, we present the first method for automatically classifying phonotrauma severity from vocal fold images. To account for the ordinal nature of the labels, we adopt a widely used ordinal regression framework. To account for label uncertainty, we propose a novel modification to ordinal regression loss functions that enables them to operate on soft labels reflecting annotator rating distributions. Our proposed soft ordinal regression method achieves predictive performance approaching that of clinical experts, while producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates.

However, these models apply each instruction in the prompt with a fixed strength, limiting the user's ability to precisely and continuously control the intensity of individual edits. We introduce SliderEdit, a framework for continuous image editing with fine-grained, interpretable instruction control. Given a multi-part edit instruction, SliderEdit disentangles the individual instructions and exposes each as a globally trained slider, allowing smooth adjustment of its strength. Unlike prior works that introduced slider-based attribute controls in text-to-image generation, typically requiring separate training or fine-tuning for each attribute or concept, our method learns a single set of low-rank adaptation matrices that generalize across diverse edits, attributes, and compositional instructions. This enables continuous interpolation along individual edit dimensions while preserving both spatial locality and global semantic consistency. We apply SliderEdit to state-of-the-art image editing models, including FLUX-Kontext and Qwen-Image-Edit, and observe substantial improvements in edit controllability, visual consistency, and user steerability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore and propose a framework for continuous, fine-grained instruction control in instruction-based image editing models.

The proposed method integrates a denoising probabilistic model that utilizes diffusion processes to generate high-quality crowd density maps. To improve accuracy, narrow Gaussian kernels are employed, and multiple density map outputs are generated. A regression branch is incorporated into the model for precise feature extraction, while a consolidation mechanism combines these maps based on similarity scores to produce a robust final result. An event-driven sampling technique, utilizing the Farneback optical flow algorithm, is introduced to selectively capture frames showing significant crowd movements, reducing computational load and storage by focusing on critical crowd dynamics.

Vision-based methods such as PALMS enable infrastructure-free localization using only a floor plan and a stationary scan, but are limited by the short range of smartphone LiDAR and ambiguity in indoor layouts. We propose PALMS$+$, a modular, image-based system that addresses these challenges by reconstructing scale-aligned 3D point clouds from posed RGB images using a foundation monocular depth estimation model (Depth Pro), followed by geometric layout matching via convolution with the floor plan. PALMS$+$ outputs a posterior over the location and orientation, usable for direct or sequential localization. Evaluated on the Structured3D and a custom campus dataset consisting of 80 observations across four large campus buildings, PALMS$+$ outperforms PALMS and F3Loc in stationary localization accuracy -- without requiring any training. Furthermore, when integrated with a particle filter for sequential localization on 33 real-world trajectories, PALMS$+$ achieved lower localization errors compared to other methods, demonstrating robustness for camera-free tracking and its potential for infrastructure-free applications.

Deep learning models have recently achieved promising results by implicitly learning such patterns from 2D trajectory data. However, most approaches treat pedestrians as point entities, ignoring the physical space that each person occupies. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel deep learning model that enhances the Social LSTM with a new Dynamic Occupied Space loss function. This loss function guides Social LSTM in learning to avoid realistic collisions without increasing displacement error across different crowd densities, ranging from low to high, in both homogeneous and heterogeneous density settings. Such a function achieves this by combining the average displacement error with a new collision penalty that is sensitive to scene density and individual spatial occupancy. For efficient training and evaluation, five datasets were generated from real pedestrian trajectories recorded during the Festival of Lights in Lyon 2022. Four datasets represent homogeneous crowd conditions -- low, medium, high, and very high density -- while the fifth corresponds to a heterogeneous density distribution. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed model not only lowers collision rates but also enhances displacement prediction accuracy in each dataset. Specifically, the model achieves up to a 31% reduction in the collision rate and reduces the average displacement error and the final displacement error by 5% and 6%, respectively, on average across all datasets compared to the baseline.

It remains unclear how pre-training domain (medical vs. general), paradigm (e.g., text-guided), and architecture influence embedding quality, hindering the selection of optimal encoders for specific radiology tasks. To address this, we evaluate vision encoders from eight medical and general-domain FMs for chest X-ray analysis. We benchmark classification (pneumothorax, cardiomegaly) and segmentation (pneumothorax, cardiac boundary) using linear probing and fine-tuning. Our results show that domain-specific pre-training provides a significant advantage; medical FMs consistently outperformed general-domain models in linear probing, establishing superior initial feature quality. However, feature utility is highly task-dependent. Pre-trained embeddings were strong for global classification and segmenting salient anatomy (e.g., heart). In contrast, for segmenting complex, subtle pathologies (e.g., pneumothorax), all FMs performed poorly without significant fine-tuning, revealing a critical gap in localizing subtle disease. Subgroup analysis showed FMs use confounding shortcuts (e.g., chest tubes for pneumothorax) for classification, a strategy that fails for precise segmentation. We also found that expensive text-image alignment is not a prerequisite; image-only (RAD-DINO) and label-supervised (Ark+) FMs were among top performers. Notably, a supervised, end-to-end baseline remained highly competitive, matching or exceeding the best FMs on segmentation tasks. These findings show that while medical pre-training is beneficial, architectural choices (e.g., multi-scale) are critical, and pre-trained features are not universally effective, especially for complex localization tasks where supervised models remain a strong alternative.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u533b\u7597\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u521d\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u75c5\u53d8\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u6bd4\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u66f4\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ecd\u5f88\u5f3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u3001\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FMs\uff09\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u516b\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u548c\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u80f8\u7247\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u810f\u80a5\u5927\uff09\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\uff08\u6c14\u80f8\u3001\u5fc3\u754c\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u505a\u5b50\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u5229\u7528\u6df7\u6dc6\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u56fe\u50cf-\u4ec5\u3001\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\uff09\u4e0e\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u6d4b\uff1b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u663e\u8457\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u3001\u7ec6\u5fae\u75c5\u53d8\uff08\u5982\u6c14\u80f8\uff09\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff1b\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u533b\u7597\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u5229\u4f46\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u5e94\u91cd\u89c6\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7ec6\u5fae\u75c5\u53d8\u9700\u66f4\u591a\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b/\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u88ab\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u91cf\u8bef\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Because of the rich texture of iris images, which spans a wide range of spatial frequencies, synthesizing same-identity iris images while controlling specific attributes remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a new iris image augmentation strategy by traversing a generative model's latent space toward latent codes that represent same-identity samples but with some desired iris image properties manipulated. The latent space traversal is guided by a gradient of specific geometrical, textural, or quality-related iris image features (e.g., sharpness, pupil size, iris size, or pupil-to-iris ratio) and preserves the identity represented by the image being manipulated. The proposed approach can be easily extended to manipulate any attribute for which a differentiable loss term can be formulated. Additionally, our approach can use either randomly generated images using either a pre-train GAN model or real-world iris images. We can utilize GAN inversion to project any given iris image into the latent space and obtain its corresponding latent code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728GAN\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u6cbf\u5c5e\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u540c\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u9632\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u53ef\u5fae\u5c5e\u6027\u548cGAN\u53cd\u6f14\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u53cd\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u540c\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u53ef\u63a7\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u6216\u901a\u8fc7GAN\u53cd\u6f14\u5f97\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6cbf\u7740\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u53ef\u5fae\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff08\u51e0\u4f55/\u7eb9\u7406/\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u6f5c\u5728\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u6539\u53d8\u5c5e\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u6dfb\u52a0\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u9879\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u539f\u56fe\u540c\u4e00\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u904d\u5386\u7684\u8679\u819c\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u53ef\u5fae\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u64cd\u63a7\u8bf8\u5982\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u77b3\u5b54/\u8679\u819c\u5c3a\u5bf8\u7b49\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301GAN\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6216\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u6f14\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ee5\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e3a\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u7075\u6d3b\u64cd\u63a7\u591a\u79cd\u8679\u819c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u53ef\u5bfc\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3GAN\u6216GAN\u53cd\u6f14\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u8679\u819c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u53cd\u6b3a\u9a97\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches typically rely on a manually annotated segmentation mask of the target in the first frame, which is labor-intensive and leads to reduced performance when faced with occlusions or rapid movement. To address these limi- tations, we propose STORM (Segment, Track, and Object Re-localization from a single 3D Model), an open-source robust real-time 6D pose estimation system that requires no manual annotation. STORM employs a novel three-stage pipeline combining vision-language understanding with self-supervised feature matching: contextual object descriptions guide localization, self-cross-attention mechanisms identify candidate regions, and a segmentation model produces precise masks for accurate pose estimation.

While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPANDA\uff1a\u7528CLIP\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u8865\u4e01\u5e76\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u9ad8\u9891\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6839\u636e\u5386\u53f2\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u53cc\u5c42\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861EFCL\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u53cc\u5c42\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff08\u4efb\u52a1\u5185\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\uff09\uff0c\u5728EFCL\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7279\u522b\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709PTM\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u89c6\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u4f4e\u9891\u7c7b\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8865\u4e01\u79fb\u690d\u5230\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u7c7b\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u8c03\u6574\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u91c7\u6837/\u589e\u5f3a\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684PTM\u7ed3\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660ePANDA\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709PTM\u57faEFCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8865\u4e01\u79fb\u690d\u4e0e\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PANDA\u5728\u5904\u7406\u53cc\u91cd\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684EFCL\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u4e01\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7c7b\u5185\u5f3a\u5316\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For this reason, episodic test-time adaptation strategies have recently emerged as powerful techniques for adapting VLMs to a single unlabeled image. However, existing adaptation strategies, such as test-time prompt tuning, typically require backpropagating through large encoder weights or altering core model components. In this work, we introduce Spectrum-Aware Test-Time Steering (STS), a lightweight adaptation framework that extracts a spectral subspace from the textual embeddings to define principal semantic directions and learns to steer latent representations in a spectrum-aware manner by adapting a small number of per-sample shift parameters to minimize entropy across augmented views. STS operates entirely at inference in the latent space, without backpropagation through or modification of the frozen encoders. Building on standard evaluation protocols, our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that STS largely surpasses or compares favorably against state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods, while introducing only a handful of additional parameters and achieving inference speeds up to 8x faster with a 12x smaller memory footprint than conventional test-time prompt tuning.

Most existing approaches depend on precomputed camera poses and scene-specific optimization, which greatly restricts their scala- bility to dynamic real-world environments. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Lumos3D, a generalizable pose-free framework for 3D low-light scene restoration. Trained once on a single dataset, Lumos3D performs inference in a purely feed- forward manner, directly restoring illumination and structure from unposed, low-light multi-view images without any per- scene training or optimization. Built upon a geometry-grounded backbone, Lumos3D reconstructs a normal-light 3D Gaussian representation that restores illumination while faithfully pre- serving structural details. During training, a cross-illumination distillation scheme is employed, where the teacher network is distilled on normal-light ground truth to transfer accurate geometric information, such as depth, to the student model.

However, existing approaches often require supervised training on curated datasets and rely on panoramic or UAV-based images, which limits real-world deployment. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective cross-view image retrieval framework that leverages a pretrained vision encoder and a large language model (LLM), requiring no additional training. Given a monocular street-view image, our method extracts geographic cues through web-based image search and LLM-based location inference, generates a satellite query via geocoding API, and retrieves matching tiles using a pretrained vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) with PCA-based whitening feature refinement. Despite using no ground-truth supervision or finetuning, our proposed method outperforms prior learning-based approaches on the benchmark dataset under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our pipeline enables automatic construction of semantically aligned street-to-satellite datasets, which is offering a scalable and cost-efficient alternative to manual annotation.

Animating Human Avatars in Diverse Scenes with Gaussian Splatting", "comment": null, "summary": "We present a novel framework for animating humans in 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a neural scene representation that has recently achieved state-of-the-art photorealistic results for novel-view synthesis but remains under-explored for human-scene animation and interaction. Unlike existing animation pipelines that use meshes or point clouds as the underlying 3D representation, our approach introduces the use of 3DGS as the 3D representation to the problem of animating humans in scenes. By representing humans and scenes as Gaussians, our approach allows for geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of humans interacting with 3D scenes. Our key insight is that the rendering can be decoupled from the motion synthesis and each sub-problem can be addressed independently, without the need for paired human-scene data. Central to our method is a Gaussian-aligned motion module that synthesizes motion without explicit scene geometry, using opacity-based cues and projected Gaussian structures to guide human placement and pose alignment. To ensure natural interactions, we further propose a human-scene Gaussian refinement optimization that enforces realistic contact and navigation. We evaluate our approach on scenes from Scannet++ and the SuperSplat library, and on avatars reconstructed from sparse and dense multi-view human capture. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework allows for novel applications such as geometry-consistent free-viewpoint rendering of edited monocular RGB videos with new animated humans, showcasing the unique advantage of 3DGS for monocular video-based human animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u75283D Gaussian Splatting \u8868\u793a\u4eba\u548c\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5408\u6210\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u6216\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u7ba1\u7ebf\u5728\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u3001\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6216\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\uff0c3DGS\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u6545\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4eba\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5747\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u5143\uff08Gaussian\uff09\uff0c\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5408\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u8026\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1Gaussian-aligned motion\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u65e0\u663e\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6295\u5f71\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u9ad8\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0e\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728Scannet++\u3001SuperSplat\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2/\u7a00\u758f\u91cd\u5efa\u4eba\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u4ea4\u4e92\u53ca\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u65b0\u4eba\u7269\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u5408\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c063D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) \u5f15\u5165\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u753b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e863DGS\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u6e32\u67d3\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u52a8\u753b\u5408\u6210\u3002"}}

In this work, we adapt a foundation model for solar physics, originally trained on Solar Dynamics Observatory imagery, to create embeddings suitable for solar wind structure analysis. These embeddings are concatenated with the spacecraft position and solar magnetic connectivity encoded using Fourier features which generates a neural field-based model. The full deep learning architecture is fine-tuned bridging the gap between remote sensing and in situ observations.

Although overall classification performance is modest, likely due to coarse labeling, class imbalance, and limited transferability of the pretrained model, this study demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging foundation model embeddings for in situ solar wind tasks. As a first proof-of-concept, it lays the groundwork for future improvements toward more reliable space weather predictions.

Achieving these tasks requires accurately separating albedo from shade. However, performing this separation on point clouds presents two key challenges: (1) the non-grid structure of point clouds makes conventional image-based decomposition models ineffective, and (2) point-cloud models designed for other tasks do not explicitly consider global-light direction, resulting in inaccurate shade. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{Intrinsic Point-Cloud Decomposition (IPCD)}, which extends image decomposition to the direct decomposition of colored point clouds into albedo and shade. To overcome challenge (1), we propose \\textbf{IPCD-Net} that extends image-based model with point-wise feature aggregation for non-grid data processing. For challenge (2), we introduce \\textbf{Projection-based Luminance Distribution (PLD)} with a hierarchical feature refinement, capturing global-light ques via multi-view projection. For comprehensive evaluation, we create a synthetic outdoor-scene dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that IPCD-Net reduces cast shadows in albedo and enhances color accuracy in shade.

However, they still face critical challenges in modeling long-range dependencies under the usage of Rotary Positional Encoding (ROPE). Although it can facilitate precise modeling of token positions, it induces progressive attention decay as token distance increases, especially with progressive attention decay over distant token pairs, which severely impairs the model's ability to remember global context. To alleviate this issue, we propose inference-only Three-step Decay Resilience Strategies (T-DRS), comprising (1) Semantic-Driven DRS (SD-DRS), amplifying semantically meaningful but distant signals via content-aware residuals, (2) Distance-aware Control DRS (DC-DRS), which can purify attention by smoothly modulating weights based on positional distances, suppressing noise while preserving locality, and (3) re-Reinforce Distant DRS (reRD-DRS), consolidating the remaining informative remote dependencies to maintain global coherence. Together, the T-DRS recover suppressed long-range token pairs without harming local inductive biases. Extensive experiments on Vision Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks demonstrate that T-DRS can consistently improve performance in a training-free manner.

Some researchers have attempted to directly apply the foundation model to the RGB-D video salient object detection (RGB-D VSOD) task, which often encounters three challenges, including the dependence on manual prompts, the high memory consumption of sequential adapters, and the computational burden of memory attention. To address the limitations, we propose a novel method, namely Segment Anything Model with Depth-guided Adaptive Queries (SAM-DAQ), which adapts SAM2 to pop-out salient objects from videos by seamlessly integrating depth and temporal cues within a unified framework. Firstly, we deploy a parallel adapter-based multi-modal image encoder (PAMIE), which incorporates several depth-guided parallel adapters (DPAs) in a skip-connection way. Remarkably, we fine-tune the frozen SAM encoder under prompt-free conditions, where the DPA utilizes depth cues to facilitate the fusion of multi-modal features. Secondly, we deploy a query-driven temporal memory (QTM) module, which unifies the memory bank and prompt embeddings into a learnable pipeline. Concretely, by leveraging both frame-level queries and video-level queries simultaneously, the QTM module can not only selectively extract temporal consistency features but also iteratively update the temporal representations of the queries.

Current 3D-VLMs directly embed the 3D point clouds into 3D tokens, following large 2D-VLMs with powerful reasoning capabilities. However, this framework has a great computational cost limiting its application, where we identify that the bottleneck lies in processing all 3D tokens in the Large Language Model (LLM) part. This raises the question: how can we reduce the computational overhead introduced by 3D tokens while preserving the integrity of their essential information? To address this question, we introduce Hierarchical Compensatory Compression (HCC-3D) to efficiently compress 3D tokens while maintaining critical detail retention. Specifically, we first propose a global structure compression (GSC), in which we design global queries to compress all 3D tokens into a few key tokens while keeping overall structural information. Then, to compensate for the information loss in GSC, we further propose an adaptive detail mining (ADM) module that selectively recompresses salient but under-attended features through complementary scoring.

One key reason is that tiny objects carry limited features that are inevitably degraded or lost during long-distance network propagation. Another is that smaller objects receive disproportionately greater regression penalties than larger ones during training. To tackle these issues, we propose a Scale-Aware Relay Layer (SARL) and a Scale-Adaptive Loss (SAL) for tiny object detection, both of which are seamlessly compatible with the top-performing frameworks. Specifically, SARL employs a cross-scale spatial-channel attention to progressively enrich the meaningful features of each layer and strengthen the cross-layer feature sharing.

This loss is able to focus training on tiny objects while reducing the influence on large objects.

Existing methods for Single-DGOD typically rely on discrete data augmentation or static perturbation methods to expand data diversity, thereby mitigating the lack of access to target domain data. However, in real-world scenarios such as changes in weather or lighting conditions, domain shifts often occur continuously and gradually. Discrete augmentations and static perturbations fail to effectively capture the dynamic variation of feature distributions, thereby limiting the model's ability to perceive fine-grained cross-domain differences. To this end, we propose a new method, Liquid Temporal Feature Evolution, which simulates the progressive evolution of features from the source domain to simulated latent distributions by incorporating temporal modeling and liquid neural network-driven parameter adjustment. Specifically, we introduce controllable Gaussian noise injection and multi-scale Gaussian blurring to simulate initial feature perturbations, followed by temporal modeling and a liquid parameter adjustment mechanism to generate adaptive modulation parameters, enabling a smooth and continuous adaptation across domains. By capturing progressive cross-domain feature evolution and dynamically regulating adaptation paths, our method bridges the source-unknown domain distribution gap, significantly boosting generalization and robustness to unseen shifts.

However, this approach is susceptible to distribution drift, caused by the sequential optimization of shared backbone parameters. This results in a mismatch between the distributions of the previously learned classes and that of the updater model, ultimately degrading the effectiveness of classifier performance over time. To address this issue, we introduce a latent space transition operator and propose Sequential Learning with Drift Compensation (SLDC). SLDC aims to align feature distributions across tasks to mitigate the impact of drift. First, we present a linear variant of SLDC, which learns a linear operator by solving a regularized least-squares problem that maps features before and after fine-tuning. Next, we extend this with a weakly nonlinear SLDC variant, which assumes that the ideal transition operator lies between purely linear and fully nonlinear transformations. This is implemented using learnable, weakly nonlinear mappings that balance flexibility and generalization. To further reduce representation drift, we apply knowledge distillation (KD) in both algorithmic variants. Extensive experiments on standard CIL benchmarks demonstrate that SLDC significantly improves the performance of SeqFT. Notably, by combining KD to address representation drift with SLDC to compensate distribution drift, SeqFT achieves performance comparable to joint training across all evaluated datasets.

However, advanced deep learning-based ReID models are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, where imperceptible perturbations to pedestrian images can cause entirely incorrect predictions, posing significant security threats. Although numerous adversarial defense strategies have been proposed for classification tasks, their extension to metric learning tasks such as person ReID remains relatively unexplored. Moreover, the several existing defenses for person ReID fail to address the inherent unique challenges of adversarially robust ReID. In this paper, we systematically identify the challenges of adversarial defense in person ReID into two key issues: model bias and composite generalization requirements. To address them, we propose a debiased dual-invariant defense framework composed of two main phases. In the data balancing phase, we mitigate model bias using a diffusion-model-based data resampling strategy that promotes fairness and diversity in training data. In the bi-adversarial self-meta defense phase, we introduce a novel metric adversarial training approach incorporating farthest negative extension softening to overcome the robustness degradation caused by the absence of classifier. Additionally, we introduce an adversarially-enhanced self-meta mechanism to achieve dual-generalization for both unseen identities and unseen attack types.

While powerful, ViGs often face substantial computational challenges stemming from their graph construction phase, which can hinder their efficiency. To address this issue we propose AdaptViG, an efficient and powerful hybrid Vision GNN that introduces a novel graph construction mechanism called Adaptive Graph Convolution. This mechanism builds upon a highly efficient static axial scaffold and a dynamic, content-aware gating strategy called Exponential Decay Gating. This gating mechanism selectively weighs long-range connections based on feature similarity. Furthermore, AdaptViG employs a hybrid strategy, utilizing our efficient gating mechanism in the early stages and a full Global Attention block in the final stage for maximum feature aggregation. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art trade-off between accuracy and efficiency among Vision GNNs. For instance, our AdaptViG-M achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ViG-B by 0.3% while using 80% fewer parameters and 84% fewer GMACs. On downstream tasks, AdaptViG-M obtains 45.8 mIoU, 44.8 APbox, and 41.1 APmask, surpassing the much larger EfficientFormer-L7 by 0.7 mIoU, 2.2 APbox, and 2.1 APmask, respectively, with 78% fewer parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "AdaptViG\u7528\u9759\u6001\u8f74\u5411\u9aa8\u67b6+\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728ImageNet\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709Vision GNN\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3Vision GNN\u5728\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u957f\u7a0b\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9759\u6001\u9aa8\u67b6+\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387/\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptive Graph Convolution\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u8f74\u5411\u9aa8\u67b6\u6784\u9020\u57fa\u7840\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Exponential Decay Gating\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u957f\u7a0b\u8fde\u63a5\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u524d\u671f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u672b\u671f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faAdaptViG\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u6df7\u5408\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Adaptive Graph Convolution\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u8f74\u5411\u9aa8\u67b6\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\u95e8\u63a7\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u95e8\u63a7\u3001\u672b\u671f\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u805a\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u6298\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaptViG\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u8d85\u8fc7\u6216\u5339\u914d\u73b0\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eViG\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u9759\u6001+\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength.

We introduce EquS, a DMIR method that imposes equivariant information through dual sampling trajectories. To further boost EquS, we propose the Timestep-Aware Schedule (TAS) and introduce EquS$^+$. TAS prioritizes deterministic steps to enhance certainty and sampling efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that our method is compatible with previous problem-agnostic DMIR methods and significantly boosts their performance without increasing computational costs.

This paper aims to robustly fine-tune these vision-language models on in-distribution (ID) data without compromising their generalization abilities in out-of-distribution (OOD) and zero-shot settings. Current robust fine-tuning methods tackle this challenge by reusing contrastive learning, which was used in pre-training, for fine-tuning. However, we found that these methods distort the geometric structure of the embeddings, which plays a crucial role in the generalization of vision-language models, resulting in limited OOD and zero-shot performance. To address this, we propose Difference Vector Equalization (DiVE), which preserves the geometric structure during fine-tuning. The idea behind DiVE is to constrain difference vectors, each of which is obtained by subtracting the embeddings extracted from the pre-trained and fine-tuning models for the same data sample. By constraining the difference vectors to be equal across various data samples, we effectively preserve the geometric structure. Therefore, we introduce two losses: average vector loss (AVL) and pairwise vector loss (PVL). AVL preserves the geometric structure globally by constraining difference vectors to be equal to their weighted average. PVL preserves the geometric structure locally by ensuring a consistent multimodal alignment.

However, these systems remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that embed hidden malicious behaviors during training. A key limitation of existing backdoor attacks is their lack of physical realizability, primarily due to the digital-to-physical domain gap. Digital triggers often fail in real-world settings because they overlook material-dependent LiDAR reflection properties. On the other hand, physically constructed triggers are often unoptimized, leading to low effectiveness or easy detectability.This paper introduces Material-Oriented Backdoor Attack (MOBA), a novel framework that bridges the digital-physical gap by explicitly modeling the material properties of real-world triggers. MOBA tackles two key challenges in physical backdoor design: 1) robustness of the trigger material under diverse environmental conditions, 2) alignment between the physical trigger's behavior and its digital simulation. First, we propose a systematic approach to selecting robust trigger materials, identifying titanium dioxide (TiO_2) for its high diffuse reflectivity and environmental resilience. Second, to ensure the digital trigger accurately mimics the physical behavior of the material-based trigger, we develop a novel simulation pipeline that features: (1) an angle-independent approximation of the Oren-Nayar BRDF model to generate realistic LiDAR intensities, and (2) a distance-aware scaling mechanism to maintain spatial consistency across varying depths. We conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LiDAR-based and Camera-LiDAR fusion models, showing that MOBA achieves a 93.50% attack success rate, outperforming prior methods by over 41%.

Existing methods primarily rely on two forms of weak supervision: one-thing-one-click annotations and bounding box annotations, both of which aim to reduce labeling efforts. However, these approaches still encounter limitations, including labor-intensive annotation processes, high complexity, and reliance on expert annotators. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{DBGroup}, a two-stage weakly supervised 3D instance segmentation framework that leverages scene-level annotations as a more efficient and scalable alternative. In the first stage, we introduce a Dual-Branch Point Grouping module to generate pseudo labels guided by semantic and mask cues extracted from multi-view images. To further improve label quality, we develop two refinement strategies: Granularity-Aware Instance Merging and Semantic Selection and Propagation. The second stage involves multi-round self-training on an end-to-end instance segmentation network using the refined pseudo-labels. Additionally, we introduce an Instance Mask Filter strategy to address inconsistencies within the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBGroup achieves competitive performance compared to sparse-point-level supervised 3D instance segmentation methods, while surpassing state-of-the-art scene-level supervised 3D semantic segmentation approaches.

Quantization algorithms compress Vision Transformers (ViTs) into low-bit formats, reducing memory and computation demands with minimal accuracy degradation. However, existing methods rely on uniform precision, ignoring the diverse sensitivity of ViT components to quantization. Metric-based Mixed Precision Quantization (MPQ) is a promising alternative, but previous MPQ methods for ViTs suffer from three major limitations: 1) coarse granularity, 2) mismatch in metric scale across component types, and 3) quantization-unaware bit allocation. In this paper, we propose LampQ (Layer-wise Mixed Precision Quantization for Vision Transformers), an accurate metric-based MPQ method for ViTs to overcome these limitations. LampQ performs layer-wise quantization to achieve both fine-grained control and efficient acceleration, incorporating a type-aware Fisher-based metric to measure sensitivity. Then, LampQ assigns bit-widths optimally through integer linear programming and further updates them iteratively.

Existing approaches often operate at the object level or disjointedly handle fine-grained affordance reasoning, lacking coherent, instruction-driven grounding and reasoning. In this work, we introduce a new task: Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning, which requires an agent to predict, for each referenced affordance element in a 3D scene, a structured triplet comprising its spatial location, motion type, and motion axis, based on a task instruction. To solve this task, we propose AffordBot, a novel framework that integrates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with a tailored chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm. To bridge the gap between 3D input and 2D-compatible MLLMs, we render surround-view images of the scene and project 3D element candidates into these views, forming a rich visual representation aligned with the scene geometry. Our CoT pipeline begins with an active perception stage, prompting the MLLM to select the most informative viewpoint based on the instruction, before proceeding with step-by-step reasoning to localize affordance elements and infer plausible interaction motions. Evaluated on the SceneFun3D dataset, AffordBot achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating strong generalization and physically grounded reasoning with only 3D point cloud input and MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u4e3a3D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u5143\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f74\u3002\u63d0\u51faAffordBot\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06MLLMs\u4e0e\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u73af\u89c6\u56fe\u5e76\u5c063D\u5019\u9009\u6295\u5f71\u52302D\u89c6\u56fe\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u518d\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u63a8\u65ad\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SceneFun3D\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86SOTA\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u6216\u5355\u72ec\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u7531\u6307\u4ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u57283D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "1) \u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1Fine-grained 3D Embodied Reasoning\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u88ab\u5f15\u7528\u5143\u7d20\u7684(\u4f4d\u7f6e,\u8fd0\u52a8\u7c7b\u578b,\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f74)\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff1b2) \u5c063D\u70b9\u4e91\u6e32\u67d3\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c063D\u5019\u9009\u5143\u7d20\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89c6\u56fe\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1CoT\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5148\u7531MLLM\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u6709\u4fe1\u606f\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u518d\u9010\u6b65\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b4) \u5728SceneFun3D\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3/\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u5728SceneFun3D\u4e0a\uff0cAffordBot\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86SOTA\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4f9d\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u53ea\u4f7f\u75283D\u70b9\u4e91\u8f93\u5165\u4e0eMLLMs\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "AffordBot\u5229\u7528MLLM\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9aCoT\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u73af\u89c6\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89d2\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea63D\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5728SceneFun3D\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ec5\u7528\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0eMLLM\u5373\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u6709\u636e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

By unifying both visual and textual cues through a crossmodal prompt encoding scheme, Anomagic leverages rich contextual information to steer an inpainting-based generation pipeline. A subsequent contrastive refinement strategy enforces precise alignment between synthesized anomalies and their masks, thereby bolstering downstream anomaly detection accuracy. To facilitate training, we introduce AnomVerse, a collection of 12,987 anomaly-mask-caption triplets assembled from 13 publicly available datasets, where captions are automatically generated by multimodal large language models using structured visual prompts and template-based textual hints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomagic trained on AnomVerse can synthesize more realistic and varied anomalies than prior methods, yielding superior improvements in downstream anomaly detection. Furthermore, Anomagic can generate anomalies for any normal-category image using user-defined prompts, establishing a versatile foundation model for anomaly generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Anomagic\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u914d\u5408AnomVerse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7cbe\u70bc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5408\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fee\u8865(inpainting)\u751f\u6210\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u8865\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u7ebf\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u533a\u57df\uff1b3) \u5bf9\u6bd4\u7cbe\u70bc\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u5408\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0e\u63a9\u7801\u7cbe\u786e\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b4) \u6784\u5efaAnomVerse\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "Anomagic\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u793a\u4f8b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fee\u8865\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u70bc\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6AnomVerse\u753112987\u4e2a\u5f02\u5e38-\u63a9\u7801-\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6784\u6210\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7531\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAnomagic\u5728\u53ef\u89c6\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u6b63\u5e38\u7c7b\u522b\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "conclusion": "Anomagic\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u5f02\u5e38\u793a\u4f8b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408AnomVerse\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u6210\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, detecting distant, small, or occluded objects (hard instances) remains a challenge, which directly compromises the safety of autonomous driving systems. We observe that existing multi-modal 3D object detection methods often follow a single-guided paradigm, failing to account for the differences in information density of hard instances between modalities. In this work, we propose DGFusion, based on the Dual-guided paradigm, which fully inherits the advantages of the Point-guide-Image paradigm and integrates the Image-guide-Point paradigm to address the limitations of the single paradigms. The core of DGFusion, the Difficulty-aware Instance Pair Matcher (DIPM), performs instance-level feature matching based on difficulty to generate easy and hard instance pairs, while the Dual-guided Modules exploit the advantages of both pair types to enable effective multi-modal feature fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFusion outperforms the baseline methods, with respective improvements of +1.0\\% mAP, +0.8\\% NDS, and +1.3\\% average recall on nuScenes.

In this paper, we reveal a key property that is overlooked by existing methods: normal image patches across industrial products typically find many other similar patches, not only in 2D appearance but also in 3D shapes, while anomalies remain diverse and isolated. To explicitly leverage this discriminative property, we propose a Mutual Scoring framework (MuSc-V2) for zero-shot AC/AS, which flexibly supports single 2D/3D or multimodality. Specifically, our method begins by improving 3D representation through Iterative Point Grouping (IPG), which reduces false positives from discontinuous surfaces. Then we use Similarity Neighborhood Aggregation with Multi-Degrees (SNAMD) to fuse 2D/3D neighborhood cues into more discriminative multi-scale patch features for mutual scoring. The core comprises a Mutual Scoring Mechanism (MSM) that lets samples within each modality to assign score to each other, and Cross-modal Anomaly Enhancement (CAE) that fuses 2D and 3D scores to recover modality-specific missing anomalies. Finally, Re-scoring with Constrained Neighborhood (RsCon) suppresses false classification based on similarity to more representative samples.

However, the study of image screening is rare and its performance with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is unsatisfactory due to the lack of data and the weak image aesthetic reasoning ability in MLLMs. In this work, we propose a complete solution to address these problems in terms of data and methodology. For data, we collect a comprehensive image screening dataset with over 128k samples, about 640k images. Each sample consists of an original image, four generated images. The dataset evaluates the image aesthetic reasoning ability under four aspects: appearance deformation, physical shadow, placement layout, and extension rationality. Regarding data annotation, we investigate multiple approaches, including purely manual, fully automated, and answer-driven annotations, to acquire high-quality chains of thought (CoT) data in the most cost-effective manner. Methodologically, we introduce a Hard Cases Mining (HCM) strategy with a Dynamic Proportional Accuracy (DPA) reward into the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework, called HCM-GRPO. This enhanced method demonstrates superior image aesthetic reasoning capabilities compared to the original GRPO. Our experimental results reveal that even state-of-the-art closed-source MLLMs, such as GPT4o and Qwen-VL-Max, exhibit performance akin to random guessing in image aesthetic reasoning.

To study this, we introduce a new benchmark, AV-ConfuseBench, which simulates an ``Audio-Visual Confusion'' scene by modifying the corresponding sound of an object in the video, e.g., mute the sounding object and ask MLLMs Is there a/an muted-object sound''. Experimental results reveal that MLLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemini 2.5, struggle to discriminate non-existent audio due to visually dominated reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we introduce RL-CoMM, a Reinforcement Learning-based Collaborative Multi-MLLM that is built upon the Qwen2.5-Omni foundation. RL-CoMM includes two stages: 1) To alleviate visually dominated ambiguities, we introduce an external model, a Large Audio Language Model (LALM), as the reference model to generate audio-only reasoning. Then, we design a Step-wise Reasoning Reward function that enables MLLMs to self-improve audio-visual reasoning with the audio-only reference. 2) To ensure an accurate answer prediction, we introduce Answer-centered Confidence Optimization to reduce the uncertainty of potential heterogeneous reasoning differences. Extensive experiments on audio-visual question answering and audio-visual hallucination show that RL-CoMM improves the accuracy by 10~30\\% over the baseline model with limited training data.

This leads to confirmation bias, especially under sparse annotations or class imbalance, where models overfit confident errors and fail to generalize. We propose CABIN (Cognitive-Aware Behavior-Informed learNing), a semi-supervised framework that addresses this limitation through a closed-loop learning process of perception, action, and correction. CABIN first develops perceptual awareness by estimating epistemic uncertainty, identifying ambiguous regions where errors are likely to occur. It then acts by adopting an Uncertainty-Guided Dual Sampling Strategy, selecting uncertain samples for exploration while anchoring confident ones as stable pseudo-labels to reduce bias. To correct noisy supervision, CABIN introduces a Fine-Grained Dynamic Assignment Strategy that categorizes pseudo-labeled data into reliable, ambiguous, and noisy subsets, applying tailored losses to enhance generalization.

Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity.

Existing generative methods typically operate on local joint rotations, which are defined hierarchically based on the skeleton structure. This leads to cumulative errors during generation, manifesting as unstable and implausible motions at end-effectors. In this work, we propose GlobalDiff, a diffusion-based framework that operates directly in the space of global joint rotations for the first time, fundamentally decoupling each joint's prediction from upstream dependencies and alleviating hierarchical error accumulation. To compensate for the absence of structural priors in global rotation space, we introduce a multi-level constraint scheme. Specifically, a joint structure constraint introduces virtual anchor points around each joint to better capture fine-grained orientation. A skeleton structure constraint enforces angular consistency across bones to maintain structural integrity. A temporal structure constraint utilizes a multi-scale variational encoder to align the generated motion with ground-truth temporal patterns.

However, the large number of visual tokens introduces significant computational overhead. To address this issue, visual token pruning has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs. In cognitive science, humans tend to first determine which regions of a scene to attend to (\"where to look\") before deciding which specific elements within those regions to process in detail (\"what to select\"). This two-stage strategy enables the visual system to efficiently allocate attention at a coarse spatial level before performing fine-grained selection. However, existing pruning methods primarily focus on directly optimizing \"what to select\", typically using attention scores or similarity metrics. They rarely consider \"where to look\", which has been shown to lead to inefficient spatial allocation, positional bias, and the retention of irrelevant or redundant tokens. In this paper, we propose GridPrune, a method that replaces the global Top-K mechanism with a \"guide-globally, select-locally\" zonal selection system. GridPrune splits the pruning process into two steps: first, it uses text-conditional guidance to dynamically allocate a token budget across spatial zones; and then, it performs local selection within each budgeted zone. Experimental results demonstrate that GridPrune achieves superior performance across various MLLM architectures. On LLaVA-NeXT-7B, GridPrune retains 96.98% of the full performance while using 11.1% of the tokens, outperforming the best-performing baseline by 2.34% at the same pruning rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "GridPrune replaces global Top-K with guide-globally select-locally zonal selection, improving efficiency and performance in MLLMs.", "motivation": "Reduce computational overhead from many visual tokens in MLLMs by mimicking human two-stage attention (where to look, what to select).", "method": "Paper analysis", "result": "GridPrune uses text-conditional zonal token budget allocation then local selection; on LLaVA-NeXT-7B retains 96.98% performance with 11.1% tokens, +2.34% vs best baseline.", "conclusion": "Text-guided zonal allocation plus local selection yields better token efficiency and accuracy than global Top-K pruning methods."}}

In this paper, we explore the combination of LLMs with the human skeleton to perform action classification and description.

To address these problems, we introduce a novel paradigm named learning Skeleton representation with visUal-motion knowledGe for Action Recognition (SUGAR). In our pipeline, we first utilize off-the-shelf large-scale video models as a knowledge base to generate visual, motion information related to actions. Then, we propose to supervise skeleton learning through this prior knowledge to yield discrete representations. Finally, we use the LLM with untouched pre-training weights to understand these representations and generate the desired action targets and descriptions. Notably, we present a Temporal Query Projection (TQP) module to continuously model the skeleton signals with long sequences.

However, the security vulnerabilities of LVLMs have become increasingly concerning, particularly their susceptibility to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks focus on single-target attacks, i.e., targeting a single malicious output associated with a specific trigger. In this work, we uncover multi-target backdoor attacks, where multiple independent triggers corresponding to different attack targets are added in a single pass of training, posing a greater threat to LVLMs in real-world applications. Executing such attacks in LVLMs is challenging since there can be many incorrect trigger-target mappings due to severe feature interference among different triggers. To address this challenge, we propose MTAttack, the first multi-target backdoor attack framework for enforcing accurate multiple trigger-target mappings in LVLMs. The core of MTAttack is a novel optimization method with two constraints, namely Proxy Space Partitioning constraint and Trigger Prototype Anchoring constraint. It jointly optimizes multiple triggers in the latent space, with each trigger independently mapping clean images to a unique proxy class while at the same time guaranteeing their separability. Experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate a high success rate of MTAttack for multi-target attacks, substantially outperforming existing attack methods. Furthermore, our attack exhibits strong generalizability across datasets and robustness against backdoor defense strategies. These findings highlight the vulnerability of LVLMs to multi-target backdoor attacks and underscore the urgent need for mitigating such threats.

We trace this failure to three key factors. First, training data show a near-total absence of explicit negations.

To address these limitations, we propose the Generation-Enhanced Alignment (GEA) from a generative perspective.

These generated images enrich the semantic representation of text and facilitate cross-modal alignment.

In real-world scenarios, images often contain multiple degradations simultaneously, such as rain, noise, and haze, requiring models capable of handling diverse degradation types. Moreover, methods that improve performance through module stacking often suffer from limited interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability-driven approach for multi-degradation image restoration, built upon a deep unfolding network that maps the iterative process of a mathematical optimization algorithm into a learnable network structure. Specifically, we employ an improved second-order semi-smooth Newton algorithm to ensure that each module maintains clear physical interpretability. To further enhance interpretability and adaptability, we design an explainable convolution module inspired by the human brain's flexible information processing and the intrinsic characteristics of images, allowing the network to flexibly leverage learned knowledge and autonomously adjust parameters for different input.

Existing methods often fail to jointly capture agents' long-term goals and their fine-grained social interactions, which leads to unrealistic multi-agent futures. We propose VISTA, a recursive goal-conditioned transformer for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. VISTA combines (i) a cross-attention fusion module that integrates long-horizon intent with past motion, (ii) a social-token attention mechanism for flexible interaction modeling across agents, and (iii) pairwise attention maps that make social influence patterns interpretable at inference time. Our model turns single-agent goal-conditioned prediction into a coherent multi-agent forecasting framework. Beyond standard displacement metrics, we evaluate trajectory collision rates as a measure of joint realism. On the high-density MADRAS benchmark and on SDD, VISTA achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and substantially fewer collisions. On MADRAS, it reduces the average collision rate of strong baselines from 2.14 to 0.03 percent, and on SDD it attains zero collisions while improving ADE, FDE, and minFDE.

Previous methods have predominantly employed diffusion models for high-fidelity reconstruction. However, their multi-step iterative sampling incurs significant computational overhead, limiting its real-time applicability. To address this, we propose LiNeXt-a lightweight, non-diffusion network optimized for rapid and accurate point cloud completion. Specifically, LiNeXt first applies the Noise-to-Coarse (N2C) Module to denoise the input noisy point cloud in a single pass, thereby obviating the multi-step iterative sampling of diffusion-based methods. The Refine Module then takes the coarse point cloud and its intermediate features from the N2C Module to perform more precise refinement, further enhancing structural completeness. Furthermore, we observe that LiDAR point clouds exhibit a distance-dependent spatial distribution, being densely sampled at proximal ranges and sparsely sampled at distal ranges.

However, as more agents participate, existing frameworks face two key challenges: (1) the participating agents are inherently multi-modal and heterogeneous, and (2) the collaborative framework must be scalable to accommodate new agents. The former requires effective cross-agent feature alignment to mitigate heterogeneity loss, while the latter renders full-parameter training impractical, highlighting the importance of scalable adaptation. To address these issues, we propose Heterogeneous Adaptation (HeatV2X), a scalable collaborative framework. We first train a high-performance agent based on heterogeneous graph attention as the foundation for collaborative learning. Then, we design Local Heterogeneous Fine-Tuning and Global Collaborative Fine-Tuning to achieve effective alignment and interaction among heterogeneous agents. The former efficiently extracts modality-specific differences using Hetero-Aware Adapters, while the latter employs the Multi-Cognitive Adapter to enhance cross-agent collaboration and fully exploit the fusion potential. These designs enable substantial performance improvement of the collaborative framework with minimal training cost. We evaluate our approach on the OPV2V-H and DAIR-V2X datasets.

This is a challenging task since it involves complex vision-language understanding and spatiotemporal reasoning. Recent works have explored weakly-supervised setting in STVG to eliminate reliance on fine-grained annotations like bounding boxes or temporal stamps. However, they typically follow a simple late-fusion manner, which generates tubes independent of the text description, often resulting in failed target identification and inconsistent target tracking. To address this limitation, we propose a Tube-conditioned Reconstruction with Mutual Constraints (\\textbf{TubeRMC}) framework that generates text-conditioned candidate tubes with pre-trained visual grounding models and further refine them via tube-conditioned reconstruction with spatio-temporal constraints. Specifically, we design three reconstruction strategies from temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal perspectives to comprehensively capture rich tube-text correspondences. Each strategy is equipped with a Tube-conditioned Reconstructor, utilizing spatio-temporal tubes as condition to reconstruct the key clues in the query. We further introduce mutual constraints between spatial and temporal proposals to enhance their quality for reconstruction.

Existing AQA methods primarily predict scores based on features extracted from the entire video, resulting in limited interpretability and reliability. Meanwhile, existing AQA datasets also lack fine-grained annotations for action scores, especially for deduction items and sub-score annotations. In this paper, we construct the first AQA dataset containing fine-grained sub-score and deduction annotations for aerial skiing, which will be released as a new benchmark. For the technical challenges, we propose a novel AQA method, named JudgeMind, which significantly enhances performance and reliability by simulating the judgment and scoring mindset of professional referees. Our method segments the input action video into different stages and scores each stage to enhance accuracy.

The task integrates three subtasks: emotion recognition, facial Action Unit (AU) recognition, and AU-based emotion reasoning to model affective states jointly. While recent approaches leverage Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and achieve promising results, they face two critical limitations: (1) hallucinated reasoning, where VLMs generate plausible but inaccurate explanations due to insufficient emotion-specific knowledge; and (2) misalignment between emotion reasoning and recognition, caused by fragmented connections between observed facial features and final labels. We propose Facial-R1, a three-stage alignment framework that effectively addresses both challenges with minimal supervision. First, we employ instruction fine-tuning to establish basic emotional reasoning capability. Second, we introduce reinforcement training guided by emotion and AU labels as reward signals, which explicitly aligns the generated reasoning process with the predicted emotion. Third, we design a data synthesis pipeline that iteratively leverages the prior stages to expand the training dataset, enabling scalable self-improvement of the model. Built upon this framework, we introduce FEA-20K, a benchmark dataset comprising 17,737 training and 1,688 test samples with fine-grained emotion analysis annotations.

Existing approaches typically rely on feature-selection mechanisms or region-proposal strategies to localize discriminative regions for semantic analysis. However, these methods often fail to capture discriminative cues comprehensively while introducing substantial category-agnostic redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose H3Former, a novel token-to-region framework that leverages high-order semantic relations to aggregate local fine-grained representations with structured region-level modeling. Specifically, we propose the Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM), which exploits multi-scale contextual cues to dynamically construct a weighted hypergraph among tokens. By applying hypergraph convolution, SAAM captures high-order semantic dependencies and progressively aggregates token features into compact region-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL), which enforces hierarchical semantic constraints in a non-Euclidean embedding space. The HHCL enhances inter-class separability and intra-class consistency while preserving the intrinsic hierarchical relationships among fine-grained categories. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four standard FGVC benchmarks validate the superiority of our H3Former framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "H3Former builds token-to-region aggregation via hypergraph-based SAAM and hyperbolic hierarchical contrastive loss HHCL to better capture fine-grained cues, improving FGVC performance on multiple benchmarks.", "motivation": "FGVC is hard due to subtle inter-class differences and large intra-class variations; existing methods miss comprehensive discriminative cues and add category-agnostic redundancy; need better aggregation of local representations with region-level modeling and leveraging high-order semantic relations.", "method": "Use SAAM to build a weighted hypergraph among multi-scale tokens, apply hypergraph convolution to aggregate to region-level representations; train with HHCL in hyperbolic embedding space to enforce hierarchical intra/inter-class constraints; combined into transformer-based H3Former framework.", "result": "Proposed H3Former: token-to-region framework with Semantic-Aware Aggregation Module (SAAM) using hypergraph convolution over dynamically weighted hypergraph to aggregate tokens into region-level representations; introduced Hyperbolic Hierarchical Contrastive Loss (HHCL) to enforce hierarchical semantic constraints in hyperbolic space; achieves state-of-the-art on four FGVC benchmarks.", "conclusion": "H3Former effectively captures high-order semantic relations and hierarchical category structure, reducing redundancy and improving discriminability for FGVC; validated by experiments on four benchmarks."}}

We introduce PROPA (Process-level Reasoning Optimization with interleaved Policy Alignment), a novel framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with GRPO to generate dense, process-level rewards and optimize reasoning at each intermediate step without human annotations. To overcome the cold-start problem, PROPA interleaves GRPO updates with SFT, enabling the model to learn from both successful and failed reasoning trajectories. A Process Reward Model (PRM) is further trained to guide inference-time search, aligning the test-time search with the training signal. Across seven benchmarks and four VLM backbones, PROPA consistently outperforms both SFT- and RLVR-based baselines. It achieves up to 17.0% gains on in-domain tasks and 21.0% gains on out-of-domain tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art, establishing a strong reasoning and generalization capability for visual reasoning tasks.

Existing inference-time interventions to mitigate this issue present a challenging trade-off: while methods that steer internal states or adjust output logits can be effective, they often incur substantial computational overhead, typically requiring extra forward passes. This efficiency bottleneck can limit their practicality for real-world, latency-sensitive deployments. In this work, we aim to address this trade-off with Residual-Update Directed DEcoding Regulation (RUDDER), a low-overhead framework that steers LVLMs towards visually-grounded generation. RUDDER is built on two key innovations: (1) Contextual Activation Residual Direction (CARD) vector, a per-sample visual evidence vector extracted from the residual update of a self-attention layer during a single, standard forward pass. (2) A Bayesian-inspired adaptive gate that performs token-wise injection, applying a corrective signal whose strength is conditioned on the model's deviation from the visual context.

However, the morphological heterogeneity of informal settlements presents a major challenge, hindering the ability of models trained on specific regions to generalize effectively to unseen locations. To address this, we introduce a large-scale high-resolution dataset and propose GRAM (Generalized Region-Aware Mixture-of-Experts), a two-phase test-time adaptation framework that enables robust slum segmentation without requiring labeled data from target regions. We compile a million-scale satellite imagery dataset from 12 cities across four continents for source training. Using this dataset, the model employs a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to capture region-specific slum characteristics while learning universal features through a shared backbone. During adaptation, prediction consistency across experts filters out unreliable pseudo-labels, allowing the model to generalize effectively to previously unseen regions.

Specifically, considering the huge gap in the physical characteristics between natural images and infrared images, the TSG is designed to generate text semantics only for visible images, thereby enabling preliminary visible-text modality alignment. Then, the IFE is proposed to rectify the feature embeddings of infrared images using the generated text semantics. This process injects id-related semantics into the shared image encoder, enhancing its adaptability to the infrared modality. Besides, with text serving as a bridge, it enables indirect visible-infrared modality alignment. Finally, the HSA is established to refine the high-level semantic alignment. This process ensures that the fine-tuned text semantics only contain id-related information, thereby achieving more accurate cross-modal alignment and enhancing the discriminability of the learned modal-shared representations.

Existing methods fail to simultaneously address inaccurate depth estimation in distant areas and structural degradation in close-range regions. This paper proposes a novel computational framework that integrates depth-of-field supervision and multi-view consistency supervision to advance 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach comprises two core components: (1) Depth-of-field Supervision employs a scale-recovered monocular depth estimator (e.g., Metric3D) to generate depth priors, leverages defocus convolution to synthesize physically accurate defocused images, and enforces geometric consistency through a novel depth-of-field loss, thereby enhancing depth fidelity in both far-field and near-field regions; (2) Multi-View Consistency Supervision employing LoFTR-based semi-dense feature matching to minimize cross-view geometric errors and enforce depth consistency via least squares optimization of reliable matched points. By unifying defocus physics with multi-view geometric constraints, our method achieves superior depth fidelity, demonstrating a 0.8 dB PSNR improvement over the state-of-the-art method on the Waymo Open Dataset.

However, their objectives may tend to detect the most salient response segments, while neglecting to mine diverse normal patterns separated from anomalies, and are prone to category confusion due to similar appearance, leading to unsatisfactory fine-grained classification results. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Semantic Alignment Network (DSANet) to explicitly separate abnormal and normal features from coarse-grained and fine-grained aspects, enhancing the distinguishability. Specifically, at the coarse-grained level, we introduce a self-guided normality modeling branch that reconstructs input video features under the guidance of learned normal prototypes, encouraging the model to exploit normality cues inherent in the video, thereby improving the temporal separation of normal patterns and anomalous events. At the fine-grained level, we present a decoupled contrastive semantic alignment mechanism, which first temporally decomposes each video into event-centric and background-centric components using frame-level anomaly scores and then applies visual-language contrastive learning to enhance class-discriminative representations. Comprehensive experiments on two standard benchmarks, namely XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that DSANet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "DSANet separates normal and abnormal features via prototype-guided reconstruction and decoupled contrastive alignment, improving anomaly localization and fine-grained classification; outperforms prior methods on two benchmarks.", "motivation": "Weakly-supervised video anomaly detection methods using MIL and multimodal models (e.g., CLIP) often focus on most salient segments, neglect diverse normal patterns and causing category confusion.", "method": "Coarse-grained: self-guided normality modeling branch reconstructs features under normal prototypes.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances SDG object detection by integrating the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution and Fourier transformation into a CLIP-guided pipeline. Specifically, we model the directional features of object representations using vMF to better capture domain-invariant semantic structures in the embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a Fourier-based augmentation strategy that perturbs amplitude and phase components to simulate domain shifts in the frequency domain, further improving feature robustness.

Real-world deployment requires open vocabulary generalization and low training overhead, motivating zero-shot methods rather than task-specific RL training. However, existing zero-shot methods that build explicit 3D scene graphs often compress rich visual observations into text-only relations, leading to high construction cost, irreversible loss of visual evidence, and constrained vocabularies. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multi-modal 3D Scene Graph (M3DSG), which preserves visual cues by replacing textual relational edges with dynamically assigned images. Built on M3DSG, we propose MSGNav, a zero-shot navigation system that includes a Key Subgraph Selection module for efficient reasoning, an Adaptive Vocabulary Update module for open vocabulary support, and a Closed-Loop Reasoning module for accurate exploration reasoning.

Recent defense mechanisms like Anti-DreamBooth attempt to mitigate this risk by injecting adversarial perturbations into user photos to prevent successful personalization. However, we identify two critical yet overlooked limitations of these methods. First, the adversarial examples often exhibit perceptible artifacts such as conspicuous patterns or stripes, making them easily detectable as manipulated content. Second, the perturbations are highly fragile, as even a simple, non-learned filter can effectively remove them, thereby restoring the model's ability to memorize and reproduce user identity. To investigate this vulnerability, we propose a novel evaluation framework, AntiDB_Purify, to systematically evaluate existing defenses under realistic purification threats, including both traditional image filters and adversarial purification. Results reveal that none of the current methods maintains their protective effectiveness under such threats. These findings highlight that current defenses offer a false sense of security and underscore the urgent need for more imperceptible and robust protections to safeguard user identity in personalized generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u73b0\u6709Anti-DreamBooth\u7c7b\u9632\u62a4\u5bf9\u53ef\u89c1\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u51c0\u5316\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6216\u51c0\u5316\u8fd8\u539f\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5173\u6ce8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u6613\u88ab\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u88ab\u7b80\u5355\u6ee4\u6ce2\u6216\u51c0\u5316\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5047\u5b89\u5168\u611f\uff0c\u9700\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u9632\u62a4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAntiDB_Purify\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4e2d\u503c\u3001\u9510\u5316\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u51c0\u5316\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u53bb\u566a/\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u51c0\u5316\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u62a4\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u6062\u590d\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\uff08\u5982DreamBooth\uff09\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u9762\u90e8\u8eab\u4efd\u6cc4\u9732\u65f6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6AntiDB_Purify\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u51c0\u5316\u5bf9\u9632\u62a4\u5931\u6548\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u51c0\u5316\u5a01\u80c1\u4e0b\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u969c\u7528\u6237\u8eab\u4efd\u9690\u79c1\uff1b\u7814\u7a76\u5e94\u8f6c\u5411\u9690\u853d\u6027\u66f4\u9ad8\u4e14\u5bf9\u51c0\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u9632\u62a4\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a physics-informed Transformer-VAE architecture to invert the PROSAIL radiative transfer model for simultaneous estimation of key canopy parameters from Sentinel-2 data. Unlike previous hybrid approaches that require real satellite images for self-supevised training. Our model is trained exclusively on simulated data, yet achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art methods that utilize real imagery. The Transformer-VAE incorporates the PROSAIL model as a differentiable physical decoder, ensuring that inferred latent variables correspond to physically plausible leaf and canopy properties. We demonstrate retrieval of leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) on real-world field datasets (FRM4Veg and BelSAR) with accuracy comparable to models trained with real Sentinel-2 data. Our method requires no in-situ labels or calibration on real images, offering a cost-effective and self-supervised solution for global vegetation monitoring.

However, real-world documents often feature complex layouts with multi-level tables, embedded images or formulas, and cross-page structures, which remain challenging for existing OCR systems. We introduce MonkeyOCR v1.5, a unified vision-language framework that enhances both layout understanding and content recognition through a two-stage parsing pipeline. The first stage employs a large multimodal model to jointly predict document layout and reading order, leveraging visual information to ensure structural and sequential consistency. The second stage performs localized recognition of text, formulas, and tables within detected regions, maintaining high visual fidelity while reducing error propagation. To address complex table structures, we propose a visual consistency-based reinforcement learning scheme that evaluates recognition quality via render-and-compare alignment, improving structural accuracy without manual annotations. Additionally, two specialized modules, Image-Decoupled Table Parsing and Type-Guided Table Merging, are introduced to enable reliable parsing of tables containing embedded images and reconstruction of tables crossing pages or columns.

To increase scalability, we further propose Prior-Guided Stitching (PrioStitch), which employs a downsampled global prior automatically generated using GrounDiff to guide local high-resolution predictions. We evaluate our method on the DSM-to-DTM translation task across diverse datasets, showing that GrounDiff consistently outperforms deep learning-based state-of-the-art methods, reducing RMSE by up to 93% on ALS2DTM and up to 47% on USGS benchmarks. In the task of road reconstruction, which requires both high precision and smoothness, our method achieves up to 81% lower distance error compared to specialized techniques on the GeRoD benchmark, while maintaining competitive surface smoothness using only DSM inputs, without task-specific optimization.

Clinical assessments further confirmed the effectiveness of both GT++ and 3DFETUS, demonstrating statistically significant improvements in plane estimation accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9879\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aGT++\u5229\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u5730\u6807\u4ece3D\u8d85\u58f0\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u4f30\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u9762\uff1b3DFETUS\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e76\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57283D\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9762\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee4.13 mm\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee7.93\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u83b7\u53d6\u6807\u51c6\u9762\u53d7\u80ce\u513f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u53d6\u5411\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u8005\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u8017\u65f6\u957f\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u4e3a\u9762\u90e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u52a8\u3001\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "GT++\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u5730\u6807\uff0c\u4ece\u4e09\u7ef4\u4f53\u79ef\u63a8\u65ad\u6807\u51c6\u9762\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u59ff\u6001\uff1b3DFETUS\u4e3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u57283D\u8d85\u58f0\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5730\u6807\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u5e94\u6807\u51c6\u9762\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5e73\u79fb\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u76f2\u8bc4\u6bd4\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u8d85\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee4.13 mm\u3001\u5e73\u5747\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee7.93\u00b0\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4ea6\u8bc1\u660e\u6539\u8fdb\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "GT++\u4e0e3DFETUS\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad83D\u80ce\u513f\u8d85\u58f0\u4e2d\u9762\u4f4d\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u67e5\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u652f\u6301\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Early detection is crucial as it can alter pancreas function through morphological changes and increased deposition of ectopic fat, eventually leading to organ damage. While studies have shown an association between T2DM and pancreas volume and fat content, the role of increased pancreatic surface lobularity (PSL) in patients with T2DM has not been fully investigated. In this pilot work, we propose a fully automated approach to delineate the pancreas and other abdominal structures, derive CT imaging biomarkers, and opportunistically screen for T2DM. Four deep learning-based models were used to segment the pancreas in an internal dataset of 584 patients (297 males, 437 non-diabetic, age: 45$\\pm$15 years). PSL was automatically detected and it was higher for diabetic patients (p=0.01) at 4.26 $\\pm$ 8.32 compared to 3.19 $\\pm$ 3.62 for non-diabetic patients.

In this paper, we propose SemanticVLA, a novel VLA framework that performs Semantic-Aligned Sparsification and Enhancement for Efficient Robotic Manipulation. Specifically: 1) To sparsify redundant perception while preserving semantic alignment, Semantic-guided Dual Visual Pruner (SD-Pruner) performs: Instruction-driven Pruner (ID-Pruner) extracts global action cues and local semantic anchors in SigLIP; Spatial-aggregation Pruner (SA-Pruner) compacts geometry-rich features into task-adaptive tokens in DINOv2. 2) To exploit sparsified features and integrate semantics with spatial geometry, Semantic-complementary Hierarchical Fuser (SH-Fuser) fuses dense patches and sparse tokens across SigLIP and DINOv2 for coherent representation. 3) To enhance the transformation from perception to action, Semantic-conditioned Action Coupler (SA-Coupler) replaces the conventional observation-to-DoF approach, yielding more efficient and interpretable behavior modeling for manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on simulation and real-world tasks show that SemanticVLA sets a new SOTA in both performance and efficiency. SemanticVLA surpasses OpenVLA on LIBERO benchmark by 21.1% in success rate, while reducing training cost and inference latency by 3.0-fold and 2.7-fold.SemanticVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/JiuTian-VL/SemanticVLA", "AI": {"tldr": "SemanticVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cc\u89c6\u89c9\u88c1\u526a\uff08ID-Pruner\u4e0eSA-Pruner\uff09\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\uff08SH-Fuser\uff09\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u4f5c\u8026\u5408\u5668\uff08SA-Coupler\uff09\uff0c\u5728LIBERO\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u7684SOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6d45\u5c42\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u843d\u5730\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "1) SD-Pruner\u5305\u542bID-Pruner\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eSigLIP\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u6307\u4ee4\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff09\u4e0eSA-Pruner\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eDINOv2\u5c06\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94token\uff09\uff1b2) SH-Fuser\u5c06\u7a20\u5bc6patch\u4e0e\u7a00\u758ftoken\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u95f4\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u793a\uff1b3) SA-Coupler\u4ee5\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfobservation-to-DoF\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "SemanticVLA\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u9488\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u843d\u5730\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SemanticVLA\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u611f\u77e5\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u4f5c\u5efa\u6a21\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Despite considerable progress in 4D neural rendering, existing approaches either model dynamic scenes holistically or model scenes and backgrounds separately aim to introduce parametric human priors. However, these approaches either neglect distinct motion characteristics of various components in scene especially human, leading to incomplete reconstructions, or ignore the information exchange between the separately modeled components, resulting in spatial inconsistencies and visual artifacts at human-scene boundaries.

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.", "AI": {"tldr": "One-line summary", "motivation": "The abstract claims novel task code-to-style image generation; need to explain why it's important and gaps in existing work", "method": "Describe CoTyle pipeline: discrete style codebook from images, condition T2I diffusion model, autoregressive style generator to produce novel embeddings, inference mapping numerical code to embedding then to image", "result": "Explain experiments show effectiveness, diversity, simplicity, reproducibility", "conclusion": "Concluding statement about impact and limitations"}}

To address this issue, we introduce OmniVGGT, a novel framework that can effectively benefit from an arbitrary number of auxiliary geometric modalities during both training and inference. In our framework, a GeoAdapter is proposed to encode depth and camera intrinsics/extrinsics into a spatial foundation model. It employs zero-initialized convolutions to progressively inject geometric information without disrupting the foundation model's representation space. This design ensures stable optimization with negligible overhead, maintaining inference speed comparable to VGGT even with multiple additional inputs. Additionally, a stochastic multimodal fusion regimen is proposed, which randomly samples modality subsets per instance during training. This enables an arbitrary number of modality inputs during testing and promotes learning robust spatial representations instead of overfitting to auxiliary cues. Comprehensive experiments on monocular/multi-view depth estimation, multi-view stereo, and camera pose estimation demonstrate that OmniVGGT outperforms prior methods with auxiliary inputs and achieves state-of-the-art results even with RGB-only input. To further highlight its practical utility, we integrated OmniVGGT into vision-language-action (VLA) models.

To address data scarcity, existing methods attempt to reuse 2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) models by either flattening DBT volumes or processing slices individually, thus discarding volumetric information. Alternatively, 3D reasoning approaches introduce complex architectures that require more DBT training data. Tackling these drawbacks, we propose M&M-3D, an architecture that enables learnable 3D reasoning while remaining parameter-free relative to its FFDM counterpart, M&M. M&M-3D constructs malignancy-guided 3D features, and 3D reasoning is learned through repeatedly mixing these 3D features with slice-level information. This is achieved by modifying operations in M&M without adding parameters, thus enabling direct weight transfer from FFDM.

First, an object-based image analysis (OBIA) Mamba model (OBIA-Mamba) is designed to reduce redundant computation without compromising fine-grained details by using superpixels as Mamba tokens. Second, a global-local (GLocal) dual-branch convolutional neural network (CNN)-mamba architecture is designed to jointly model local spatial detail and global contextual information. Third, a multitask optimization framework is designed to employ dual loss functions to balance local precision with global consistency.

LUA integrates as a drop-in component, requiring no modifications to the base model or additional diffusion stages, and enables high-resolution synthesis through a single feed-forward pass in latent space. A shared Swin-style backbone with scale-specific pixel-shuffle heads supports 2x and 4x factors and remains compatible with image-space SR baselines, achieving comparable perceptual quality with nearly 3x lower decoding and upscaling time (adding only +0.42 s for 1024 px generation from 512 px, compared to 1.87 s for pixel-space SR using the same SwinIR architecture). Furthermore, LUA shows strong generalization across the latent spaces of different VAEs, making it easy to deploy without retraining from scratch for each new decoder.
