An important task in such patterns is aggregation, which involves summarizing a set of values into a single value using an algebraic function, such as the maximum, sum, or average, among others. Despite the relevance of this task, query languages in CER typically support aggregation in a restricted syntactic form, and their semantics are generally undefined.\n  In this work, we present a first step toward formalizing a query language with aggregation for CER. We propose to extend Complex Event Logic (CEL), a formal query language for CER, with aggregation operations. This task requires revisiting the semantics of CEL, using a new semantics based on bags of tuples instead of sets of positions. Then, we present an extension of CEL, called Aggregation CEL (ACEL), which introduces an aggregation operator for any commutative monoid operation. The operator can be freely composed with previous CEL operators, allowing users to define complex queries and patterns. We showcase several queries in practice where ACEL proves to be natural for specifying them. From the computational side, we present a novel automata model, called Aggregation Complex Event Automata (ACEA), that extends the previous proposal of Complex Event Automata (CEA) with aggregation and filtering features. Moreover, we demonstrate that every query in ACEL can be expressed in ACEA, illustrating the effectiveness of our computational model. Finally, we study the expressiveness of ACEA through the lens of ACEL, showing that the automata model is more expressive than ACEL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u805a\u5408\u5f15\u5165\u590d\u6742\u4e8b\u4ef6\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u888b\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49ACEL\u8bed\u8a00\u548cACEA\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dCER\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u805a\u5408\u652f\u6301\u8bed\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u4e2d\u805a\u5408\u662f\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u826f\u597d\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u805a\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06CEL\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4ece\u4f4d\u7f6e\u96c6\u5408\u6539\u4e3a\u5143\u7ec4\u888b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5bf9\u4efb\u610f\u4ea4\u6362\u5e7a\u534a\u7fa4\u7684\u805a\u5408\u7b97\u5b50\u6784\u5efaACEL\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u6a21\u578bACEA\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u8fc7\u6ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4eceACEL\u5230ACEA\u7684\u53ef\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u4e0e\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faACEL\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0eACEA\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u786e\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u7ec4\u888b\u7684\u65b0\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b\u8bc1\u660eACEL\u53ef\u7528ACEA\u8868\u8fbe\u4e14ACEA\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4e8eACEL\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793aACEL\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bc6\u522b\uff08CER\uff09\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u805a\u5408\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u8a00\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u7ec4\u888b\uff08bag of tuples\uff09\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86ACEL\u8bed\u8a00\u5e76\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u673a\u6a21\u578bACEA\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ACEL\u53ef\u88abACEA\u8868\u793a\u4e14ACEA\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u8d85\u51faACEL\u3002"}}

Traditional methods involve costly iterative testing, data materialization, and manual error detection, due to the lack of formal approaches to reasoning about data granularity (grain), which can shift during transformations, causing issues like fan traps (metrics duplication) and chasm traps (data loss). We introduce the first formal, mathematical definition of grain, extending it from an informal concept in dimensional modeling to a universal, type-theoretic framework applicable to any data type. Encoding grain into the type system allows compile-time verification of transformation correctness, shifting validation from runtime. We define three core grain relations-equality, ordering, and incomparability-and prove a general grain inference theorem that computes the output grain of equi-joins from input grains using type-level operations. This covers all join scenarios, including comparable and incomparable keys. Together with inference rules for relational operations, this enables verification through schema analysis alone, at zero cost. Our approach allows engineers to verify that entire pipeline DAGs maintain correctness properties, detecting grain-related errors such as fan traps, chasm traps, and aggregation issues before data processing. It emphasizes the importance of grain, focusing on critical characteristics rather than all data details. We provide machine-checked formal proofs in Lean 4, reducing verification costs by 98-99%. Additionally, large language models can automatically generate correctness proofs, shifting human effort from proof writing to proof verification, thus democratizing formal methods in data engineering and supporting confident deployment of AI-generated pipelines with machine-checkable guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u628a\u201c\u7c92\u5ea6\u201d\uff08\u6570\u636e\u9897\u7c92\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u578b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6570\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u76f8\u7b49\u3001\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a8\u65ad\u8fde\u63a5\u540e\u8f93\u51fa\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9632\u6b62fan/chasm\u9677\u9631\u5e76\u7528Lean4\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65f6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7269\u5316\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u6392\u9519\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bfc\u81f4fan trap\u548cchasm trap\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u8bc1\u660e\u8f6c\u6362\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e0e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u7406\u8bba\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e09\u79cd\u7c92\u5ea6\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u76f8\u7b49\u3001\u6392\u5e8f\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u7ec4\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee3\u6570\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u65ad\u5b9a\u7406\u7528\u4e8e\u7b49\u503c\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u7c7b\u578b\u7ea7\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u8fde\u63a5\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5728Lean4\u4e2d\u7ed9\u51fa\u673a\u5668\u53ef\u68c0\u9a8c\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u8bc1\u660e\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u94fe\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7c7b\u578b\u7ea7\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u6267\u884c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u7c92\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u5728Lean4\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u8bc1\u660e\u5e76\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u5c06\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea698-99%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793aLLM\u53ef\u751f\u6210\u8bc1\u660e\u8349\u6848\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u5de5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u578b\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e76\u7528\u7c7b\u578b\u7ea7\u8fd0\u7b97\u63a8\u65ad\u8fde\u63a5\u8f93\u51fa\u7c92\u5ea6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4bfan trap\u3001chasm trap\u548c\u805a\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Lean4\u673a\u5668\u68c0\u67e5\u8bc1\u660e\u548cLLM\u8f85\u52a9\u8bc1\u660e\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u90e8\u7f72\u4fe1\u5fc3\u3002"}}

Graph-based indexes achieve state-of-the-art performance on unfiltered ANNS but encounter connectivity breakdown on low-selectivity filtered queries, where qualifying vectors become sparse and the graph structure among them fragments. Recent research proposes specialized graph indexes that address this issue by expanding graph degree, which incurs prohibitively high construction costs. Given these inherent limitations of graph-based methods, we argue for a dual-index architecture and present Curator, a partition-based index that complements existing graph-based approaches for low-selectivity filtered ANNS. Curator builds specialized indexes for different labels within a shared clustering tree, where each index adapts to the distribution of its qualifying vectors to ensure efficient search while sharing structure to minimize memory overhead. The system also supports incremental updates and handles arbitrary complex predicates beyond single-label filters by efficiently constructing temporary indexes on the fly. Our evaluation demonstrates that integrating Curator with state-of-the-art graph indexes reduces low-selectivity query latency by up to 20.9x compared to pre-filtering fallback, while increasing construction time and memory footprint by only 5.5% and 4.3%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Curator\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5206\u533a\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4f4e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5e26\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u641c\u7d22\uff08ANNS\uff09\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u6784\u5efa\u5171\u4eab\u805a\u7c7b\u6811\u4e0b\u7684\u4e13\u7528\u7d22\u5f15\u6765\u907f\u514d\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u4e34\u65f6\u7d22\u5f15\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u8c13\u8bcd\u3002\u8bc4\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e0e\u9884\u8fc7\u6ee4\u56de\u9000\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u591a\u964d\u4f4e20.9\u500d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4ec5\u5206\u522b\u589e\u52a05.5%\u548c4.3%\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u5728\u65e0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6216\u9ad8\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684ANNS\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f4e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0b\u56e0\u5408\u683c\u5411\u91cf\u7a00\u758f\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u5df2\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u56fe\u5ea6\u6570\u6765\u6062\u590d\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0e\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u4e92\u8865\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u7d22\u5f15\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4fdd\u7559\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u65b0\u589e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u533a\u7684Curator\u7d22\u5f15\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u67e5\u8be2\u3002Curator\u5728\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u6811\u4e0a\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6784\u5efa\u4e13\u7528\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u4f9d\u636e\u5404\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5411\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0\u5e76\u80fd\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u4e34\u65f6\u7d22\u5f15\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u8c13\u8bcd\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\uff0cCurator\u5728\u4f4e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u53ef\u5c06\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a20.9\u500d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a05.5%\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u589e\u52a04.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "Curator\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4f4e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u56fe\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u8865\u5145\u65b9\u6848\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

To establish a methodological basis for explainable emotion estimation without relying on external information such as physiological signals or subjective ratings, we have quantified \"pleasantness,\" \"surprise,\" and \"habituation\" solely from scene-level expression features of advertising videos, drawing on the free energy(FE) principle, which has provided a unified account of perception, learning, and behavior. In this framework, Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) has captured prediction error, Bayesian surprise (BS) has captured belief updates, and uncertainty (UN) has reflected prior ambiguity, and together they have formed the core components of FE. Using 1,059 15 s food video advertisements, the experiments have shown that KLD has reflected \"pleasantness\" associated with brand presentation, BS has captured \"surprise\" arising from informational complexity, and UN has reflected \"surprise\" driven by uncertainty in element types and spatial arrangements, as well as by the variability and quantity of presented elements. This study also identified three characteristic emotional patterns, namely uncertain stimulus, sustained high emotion, and momentary peak and decay, demonstrating the usefulness of the proposed method. Robustness across nine hyperparameter settings and generalization tests with six types of Japanese advertising videos (three genres and two durations) confirmed that these tendencies remained stable. This work can be extended by integrating a wider range of expression elements and validating the approach through subjective ratings, ultimately guiding the development of technologies that can support the creation of more engaging advertising videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u539f\u7406\u3001\u4ec5\u7528\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eKLD/BS/UN\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u6109\u60a6/\u60ca\u5947/\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u60c5\u611f\u53cd\u5e94\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u5a92\u4f53\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u751f\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0a\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u89e3\u6790\u5373\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u60c5\u611f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u8868\u8fbe\u8981\u7d20\uff0c\u5229\u7528Kullback-Leibler\u6563\u5ea6(KLD)\u8868\u793a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u60ca\u5947(BS)\u8868\u793a\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027(UN)\u8868\u793a\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u6210\u81ea\u7531\u80fd(FE)\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u57281059\u4e2a15s\u98df\u54c1\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e5d\u7ec4\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u53ca\u516d\u7c7b\u65e5\u6587\u5e7f\u544a\uff08\u4e0d\u540c\u4f53\u88c1\u4e0e\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eKLD\u5bf9\u5e94\u54c1\u724c\u5448\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6109\u60a6\u6027\uff0cBS\u5bf9\u4fe1\u606f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u60ca\u5947\u654f\u611f\uff0cUN\u53cd\u6620\u5143\u7d20\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e03\u5c40\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ca\u5143\u7d20\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u60ca\u5947\uff1b\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u523a\u6fc0\u3001\u6301\u7eed\u9ad8\u60c5\u611f\u3001\u77ac\u65f6\u5cf0\u503c\u4e0e\u8870\u51cf\u4e09\u79cd\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u5e7f\u544a\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7ed3\u679c\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u751f\u7406\u6216\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u60c5\u611f\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7531\u80fd\u539f\u7406\u91cf\u5316\u6109\u60a6\u6027\u3001\u60ca\u5947\u6027\u4e0e\u4e60\u60ef\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u544a\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u5957\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, the scarcity of high-quality spatial natural language query corpora limits the performance of such systems. Existing methods rely on manual knowledge base construction and template-based dynamic generation, which suffer from low construction efficiency and unstable corpus quality. This paper presents semantic-aware spatial corpus construction (SSCC), a tool designed for constructing high-quality spatial natural language query and executable language query pair corpora. SSCC consists of two core modules: (i) a knowledge base construction module based on spatial relations, which extracts and determines spatial relations from datasets, and (ii) a template-augmented query pair corpus generation module, which produces query pairs via template matching and parameter substitution. The tool ensures geometric consistency and adherence to spatial logic in the generated spatial relations. Experimental results demonstrate that SSCC achieves (i) a 53x efficiency improvement for knowledge base construction and (ii) a 2.5x effectiveness improvement for query pair corpus.

This paper explores whether contemporary open-source and publicly accessible diffusion-based generative models can produce identity document forgeries that could realistically bypass human or automated verification systems. We evaluate text-to-image and image-to-image generation pipelines using multiple publicly available generative model families, including Stable Diffusion, Qwen, Flux, Nano-Banana, and others. The findings indicate that while current generative models can simulate surface-level document aesthetics, they fail to reproduce structural and forensic authenticity. Consequently, the risk of generative identity document deepfakes achieving forensic-level authenticity may be overestimated, underscoring the value of collaboration between machine learning practitioners and document-forensics experts in realistic risk assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u8bc1\u4ef6\u7684\u56fe\u7247\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6cd5\u8bc1\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u5ea6\uff0c\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4f2a\u9020\u5177\u5907\u8bc1\u4ef6\u7ea7\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u56de\u5e94\u516c\u4f17\u5bf9\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u6ee5\u7528\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff08\u5305\u62ec Stable Diffusion\u3001Qwen\u3001Flux\u3001Nano-Banana \u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u5bdf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u4e0e\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc1\u4ef6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u6bd4\u5bf9\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u68c0\u67e5\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u3001\u5370\u5237/\u5fae\u5370\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7801/\u6761\u7801\u7f16\u7801\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u53d6\u8bc1\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u516c\u5f00\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u6a21\u62df\u8bc1\u4ef6\u5916\u89c2\uff08\u5982\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u5b57\u4f53\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u518d\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u548c\u6cd5\u8bc1\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u8bc1\u4ef6\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u6cd5\u8bc1\u6216\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u80fd\u5236\u9020\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6cd5\u8bc1\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc1\u4f2a\u9020\u4ecd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6280\u672f\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u4e0e\u8bc1\u4ef6\u6cd5\u8bc1\u4e13\u5bb6\u5408\u4f5c\u4ee5\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u5e94\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Accurate diagnosis from chest X-rays is limited by radiologist availability and variability.\n  Objective: This study compares custom CNNs trained from scratch with transfer learning (ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNet-B0) for pediatric pneumonia detection, evaluating frozen-backbone and fine-tuning regimes.\n  Methods: A dataset of 5,216 pediatric chest X-rays was split 80/10/10 for training, validation, and testing. Seven models were trained and assessed using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC. Grad-CAM visualizations provided explainability.\n  Results: Fine-tuned ResNet50 achieved the best performance: 99.43\\% accuracy, 99.61\\% F1-score, and 99.93\\% AUC, with only 3 misclassifications. Fine-tuning outperformed frozen-backbone models by 5.5 percentage points on average.

When database queries fail due to memory overload, it not only wastes critical resources such as CPU time but also disrupts the execution of core business processes, as memory-overloading (MO) queries are typically part of complex workflows. If such queries are identified in advance and scheduled to memory-rich serverless clusters, it can prevent resource wastage and query execution failure. Therefore, cloud data warehouses desire an admission control framework with high prediction precision, interpretability, efficiency, and adaptability to effectively identify MO queries. However, existing admission control frameworks primarily focus on scenarios like SLA satisfaction and resource isolation, with limited precision in identifying MO queries. Moreover, there is a lack of publicly available MO-labeled datasets with workloads for training and benchmarking. To tackle these challenges, we propose SafeLoad, the first query admission control framework specifically designed to identify MO queries. Alongside, we release SafeBench, an open-source, industrial-scale benchmark for this task, which includes 150 million real queries. SafeLoad first filters out memory-safe queries using the interpretable discriminative rule. It then applies a hybrid architecture that integrates both a global model and cluster-level models, supplemented by a misprediction correction module to identify MO queries. Additionally, a self-tuning quota management mechanism dynamically adjusts prediction quotas per cluster to improve precision. Experimental results show that SafeLoad achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance with low online and offline time overhead. Specifically, SafeLoad improves precision by up to 66% over the best baseline and reduces wasted CPU time by up to 8.09x compared to scenarios without SafeLoad.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSafeLoad\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u4ed3\u5e93\u4e2d\u5185\u5b58\u8fc7\u8f7d\uff08MO\uff09\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5165\u9662\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5305\u542b1.5\u4ebf\u6761\u771f\u5b9e\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6SafeBench\u3002SafeLoad\u5148\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5224\u522b\u89c4\u5219\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5185\u5b58\u5b89\u5168\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u518d\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7c07\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u53ca\u8bef\u5224\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522bMO\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8c03\u8282\u914d\u989d\u673a\u5236\u6309\u7c07\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u6d4b\u914d\u989d\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSafeLoad\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5728\u7ebf\u548c\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u591a66%\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06CPU\u6d6a\u8d39\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u591a8.09\u500d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u67e5\u8be2\u56e0\u5185\u5b58\u8fc7\u8f7d\u5931\u8d25\u4f1a\u6d6a\u8d39CPU\u5e76\u4e2d\u65ad\u4e1a\u52a1\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5165\u9662\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5f00MO\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u9884\u9632MO\u67e5\u8be2\u9020\u6210\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u6d6a\u8d39\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "SafeLoad\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u6b65\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1\uff09\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5224\u522b\u89c4\u5219\u7528\u4f5c\u524d\u7f6e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5254\u9664\u5185\u5b58\u5b89\u5168\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b2\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u7c07\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bef\u5224\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b3\uff09\u81ea\u8c03\u8282\u914d\u989d\u7ba1\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u6309\u7c07\u8c03\u6574\u9884\u6d4b\u914d\u989d\u4ee5\u6743\u8861\u53ec\u56de\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5728\u7ebf/\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b1.5\u4ebf\u6761\u67e5\u8be2\u7684SafeBench\u4e0a\uff0cSafeLoad\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u57fa\u7ebf\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u534766%\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u9700SafeLoad\u65f6\u6700\u591a\u5c06CPU\u6d6a\u8d39\u964d\u4f4e8.09\u500d\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5408\u7406\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "SafeLoad\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8MO\u67e5\u8be2\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u914d\u5957\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6SafeBench\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u793e\u533a\u590d\u73b0\u4e0e\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002"}}

In this study, we combine a focused review of cardiac ultrasound segmentation literature with a controlled comparison of three influential architectures, U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet, on the Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-Structure Ultrasound Segmentation (CAMUS) echocardiography dataset. Our benchmark spans multiple preprocessing routes, including native NIfTI volumes, 16-bit PNG exports, GPT-assisted polygon-based pseudo-labels, and self-supervised pretraining (SSL) on thousands of unlabeled cine frames. Using identical training splits, losses, and evaluation criteria, a plain U-Net achieved a 94% mean Dice when trained directly on NIfTI data (preserving native dynamic range), while the PNG-16-bit workflow reached 91% under similar conditions. Attention U-Net provided modest improvements on small or low-contrast regions, reducing boundary leakage, whereas TransUNet demonstrated the strongest generalization on challenging frames due to its ability to model global spatial context, particularly when initialized with SSL. Pseudo-labeling expanded the training set and improved robustness after confidence filtering. Overall, our contributions are threefold: a harmonized, apples-to-apples benchmark of U-Net, Attention U-Net, and TransUNet under standardized CAMUS preprocessing and evaluation; practical guidance on maintaining intensity fidelity, resolution consistency, and alignment when preparing ultrasound data; and an outlook on scalable self-supervision and emerging multimodal GPT-based annotation pipelines

As vector data scales rapidly, VS faces growing challenges in balancing search, latency, scalability, and cost. The evolution of VS has been closely driven by changes in storage architecture. Early VS methods rely on all-in-memory designs for low latency, but scalability is constrained by memory capacity and cost. To address this, recent research has adopted heterogeneous architectures that offload space-intensive vectors and index structures to SSDs, while exploiting block locality and I/O-efficient strategies to maintain high search performance at billion scale. Looking ahead, the increasing demand for trillion-scale vector retrieval and cloud-native elasticity is driving a further shift toward memory-SSD-object storage architectures, which enable cost-efficient data tiering and seamless scalability.\n  In this tutorial, we review the evolution of VS techniques from a storage-architecture perspective. We first review memory-resident methods, covering classical IVF, hash, quantization, and graph-based designs. We then present a systematic overview of heterogeneous storage VS techniques, including their index designs, block-level layouts, query strategies, and update mechanisms. Finally, we examine emerging cloud-native systems and highlight open research opportunities for future large-scale vector retrieval systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Paper surveys vector search evolution focusing on storage architectures: in-memory methods, SSD-based heterogeneous systems, and emerging cloud-native tiered designs; discusses index/layout/query/update techniques and future research directions for scalable, cost-efficient retrieval.", "motivation": "Vector search must scale to billion/trillion vectors while keeping low latency and cost; storage architecture evolution drives solutions from in-memory to heterogeneous and cloud-native tiers.", "method": "Review from storage-architecture perspective", "result": "Survey of memory-resident methods (IVF, hashing, quantization, graph), heterogeneous storage designs (SSD offload, block layouts, I/O-efficient query/update), and cloud-native memory-SSD-object architectures; identification of open problems for trillion-scale retrieval.", "conclusion": "Heterogeneous and cloud-native architectures are key for scaling VS to trillion vectors; future work needed on tiering strategies, consistency, cost-latency tradeoffs, and system-level integration."}}

To enable real-time analytics under limited computational, memory, and communication resources, matrix sketching techniques have been developed over recent decades to provide compact approximations of such streaming data. Some algorithms have achieved optimal space and communication complexity. However, these approaches often require frequent time-consuming matrix factorization operations. In particular, under tight approximation error bounds, each matrix factorization computation incurs cubic time complexity, thereby limiting their update efficiency.\n  In this paper, we introduce AeroSketch, a novel matrix sketching framework that leverages recent advances in randomized numerical linear algebra (RandNLA). AeroSketch achieves optimal communication and space costs while delivering near-optimal update time complexity (within logarithmic factors) across persistent, sliding window, and distributed streaming scenarios.

However, radiographic distinctions between early disease stages, particularly KL1 and KL2, are subtle and frequently lead to inter-observer variability among radiologists. To address these challenges, we propose VLOrdinalFormer, a vision language guided ordinal learning framework for fully automated KOA grading from knee radiographs. The proposed method combines a ViT L16 backbone with CORAL based ordinal regression and a Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) driven semantic alignment module, allowing the model to incorporate clinically meaningful textual concepts related to joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, and subchondral sclerosis. To improve robustness and mitigate overfitting, we employ stratified five fold cross validation, class aware re weighting to emphasize challenging intermediate grades, and test time augmentation with global threshold optimization. Experiments conducted on the publicly available OAI kneeKL224 dataset demonstrate that VLOrdinalFormer achieves state of the art performance, outperforming CNN and ViT baselines in terms of macro F1 score and overall accuracy. Notably, the proposed framework yields substantial performance gains for KL1 and KL2 without compromising classification accuracy for mild or severe cases. In addition, interpretability analyses using Grad CAM and CLIP similarity maps confirm that the model consistently attends to clinically relevant anatomical regions. These results highlight the potential of vision language aligned ordinal transformers as reliable and interpretable tools for KOA grading and disease progression assessment in routine radiological practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5e8f\u6570\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684ViT\u6846\u67b6\uff08VLOrdinalFormer\uff09\u6709\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u819d\u9aa8\u5173\u8282\u708eKL\u5206\u7ea7\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u65e9\u671f\uff08KL1/KL2\uff09\u533a\u5206\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0aKOA\u65e9\u671f\u5206\u7ea7\uff08\u5c24\u5176KL1\u4e0eKL2\uff09\u5728\u653e\u5c04\u7247\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u5fae\u5c0f\uff0c\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u5e08\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5e8f\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5206\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528ViT-L16\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CORAL\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e8f\u6570\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u5e76\u501f\u52a9CLIP\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\u5173\u8282\u95f4\u9699\u53d8\u7a84\u3001\u9aa8\u8d58\u5f62\u6210\u3001\u76ae\u8d28\u4e0b\u786c\u5316\uff09\u878d\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u4e94\u6298\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u53ca\u5168\u5c40\u9608\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u7684OAI kneeKL224\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cVLOrdinalFormer\u5728macro F1\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86state-of-the-art\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86KL1\u548cKL2\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6Grad-CAM\u4e0eCLIP\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u533a\u57df\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5173\u5207\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "VLOrdinalFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u5e8f\u6570\u56de\u5f52\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86KOA\u5206\u7ea7\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728KL1\u4e0eKL2\u7684\u533a\u5206\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u660e\u663e\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eCNN\u548c\u666e\u901aViT\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Existing data discovery systems assume that each question can be answered by a single table and often rely on resource-intensive offline preprocessing, such as model training or large-scale content indexing. In practice, however, many questions require information spread across multiple tables -- either independently or through joins -- and users often seek specific cell values rather than entire tables. In this paper, we present Octopus, a lightweight, entity-aware, and training-free system for multi-table data discovery and cell-level value retrieval. Instead of embedding entire questions, Octopus identifies fine-grained entities (column mentions and value mentions) from natural-language queries using an LLM parser. It then matches these entities to table headers through a compact embedding index and scans table contents directly for value occurrences, eliminating the need for heavy content indexing or costly offline stages. The resulting fine-grained alignment not only improves table retrieval accuracy but also facilitates efficient downstream NL2SQL execution by reducing token usage and redundant LLM calls. To evaluate Octopus, we introduce a new benchmark covering both table- and cell-level discovery under multi-table settings, including five datasets for independent discovery and two for join-based discovery. Experimental results show that Octopus consistently outperforms existing systems while achieving substantially lower computational and token costs.

However, current RL paradigms predominantly rely on random data shuffling or naive curriculum strategies based on scalar difficulty metrics. We argue that scalar metrics fail to disentangle two orthogonal challenges in video understanding: Visual Temporal Perception Load and Cognitive Reasoning Depth. To address this, we propose VideoCuRL, a novel framework that decomposes difficulty into these two axes. We employ efficient, training-free proxies, optical flow and keyframe entropy for visual complexity, Calibrated Surprisal for cognitive complexity, to map data onto a 2D curriculum grid. A competence aware Diagonal Wavefront strategy then schedules training from base alignment to complex reasoning.

This study presents a systematic comparative analysis of five widely used CNN backbones, namely VGG16, VGG19, Inception V3, ResNet50, and ResNet101, based on 245 controlled experiments combining quantitative metrics, qualitative assessment, and statistical analysis to examine the trade-off between structural preservation, stylistic behavior, and computational efficiency. The results show that backbone selection does not yield statistically significant differences in structural similarity, as confirmed by ANOVA on SSIM (p= 0.83), indicating comparable levels of structural preservation rather than equivalent stylistic quality. Within this context, ResNet-based architectures achieve approximately 5-6x faster convergence than VGG models while maintaining similar perceptual similarity (LPIPS = 0.53) and requiring over 16x fewer FLOPs (0.63 vs 10.12 GFLOPs). Qualitative analysis reveals consistent stylistic trade-offs, with VGG producing denser painterly textures, ResNet favoring geometric stability and canting stroke preservation with milder stylization, and Inception V3 exhibiting intermediate but noisier behavior. These findings reposition architectural choice in NST from maximizing stylistic intensity toward efficiency-aware and structure-preserving deployment, highlighting ResNet-based backbones as a practical foundation for scalable, industry-oriented batik generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86VGG16\u3001VGG19\u3001Inception V3\u3001ResNet50\u548cResNet101\u4e94\u79cdCNN\u4f5c\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u5370\u5c3c\u8721\u67d3\uff08batik\uff09\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7245\u6b21\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e3aResNet\u7cfb\u5217\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7c7b\u4f3c\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff08LPIPS\u22480.53\uff09\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff08SSIM\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff0cp=0.83\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4VGG\u5feb5-6\u500d\uff0cFLOPs\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea616\u500d\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0e\u4ea7\u4e1a\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "VGG\u7cfb\u867d\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0a\u5f3a\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4ea7\u4e1a\u5316\u5e94\u7528\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5bfb\u627e\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4e94\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41CNN\u9aa8\u5e72\u8fdb\u884c245\u6b21\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff08SSIM\u3001LPIPS\u3001FLOPs\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u7b49\uff09\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u68c0\u9a8c\uff08ANOVA\uff09\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u5b58\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u8868\u73b0\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "ANOVA\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540c\u9aa8\u5e72\u5728SSIM\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff08p=0.83\uff09\uff1bResNet\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8f83VGG\u5feb\u7ea65-6\u500d\uff0cFLOPs\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\uff080.63 vs 10.12 GFLOPs\uff09\uff0c\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6LPIPS\u7ea60.53\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0aVGG\u4ea7\u51fa\u66f4\u6d53\u5bc6\u7684\u7ed8\u753b\u8d28\u611f\uff0cResNet\u4fdd\u7559\u66f4\u591a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0ecanting\u7b14\u89e6\uff0cInception V3\u8868\u73b0\u5c45\u4e2d\u4f46\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u591a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\uff08SSIM\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u8d28\u611f\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u5f02\uff1bResNet\u7cfb\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f73\u6298\u8877\uff0c\u662f\u9762\u5411\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4ea7\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9996\u9009\u3002"}}

This work introduces CornViT, a three-stage Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) framework that emulates the hierarchical reasoning of human seed analysts for single-kernel evaluation. Three sequential CvT-13 classifiers operate on 384x384 RGB images: Stage 1 distinguishes pure from impure kernels; Stage 2 categorizes pure kernels into flat and round morphologies; and Stage 3 determines the embryo orientation (up vs. down) for pure, flat kernels. Starting from a public corn seed image collection, we manually relabeled and filtered images to construct three stage-specific datasets: 7265 kernels for purity, 3859 pure kernels for morphology, and 1960 pure-flat kernels for embryo orientation, all released as benchmarks. Head-only fine-tuning of ImageNet-22k pretrained CvT-13 backbones yields test accuracies of 93.76% for purity, 94.11% for shape, and 91.12% for embryo-orientation detection. Under identical training conditions, ResNet-50 reaches only 76.56 to 81.02 percent, whereas DenseNet-121 attains 86.56 to 89.38 percent accuracy. These results highlight the advantages of convolution-augmented self-attention for kernel analysis. To facilitate adoption, we deploy CornViT in a Flask-based web application that performs stage-wise inference and exposes interpretable outputs through a browser interface. Together, the CornViT framework, curated datasets, and web application provide a deployable solution for automated corn kernel quality assessment in seed quality workflows.

In this study, we explore the application of cutting-edge vision-language models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Claude 3.5) for predicting the recyclability of commonly disposed items. Utilizing a curated dataset of images, we evaluated the models' ability to match objects to appropriate recycling bins, including assessing whether the items could physically fit into the available bins.

In this work, we propose TDA-Alz, a novel framework for four-stage Alzheimer's disease severity classification (non-demented, moderate dementia, mild, and very mild) using topological data analysis (TDA) and ensemble learning. Instead of relying on deep convolutional architectures or extensive data augmentation, our approach extracts topological descriptors that capture intrinsic structural patterns of brain MRI, followed by feature selection to retain the most discriminative topological features. These features are then classified using an ensemble learning strategy to achieve robust multiclass discrimination.\n  Experiments conducted on the OASIS-1 MRI dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.19% and an AUC of 99.75%, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art deep learning--based methods reported on OASIS and OASIS-derived datasets. Notably, the proposed framework does not require data augmentation, pretrained networks, or large-scale computational resources, making it computationally efficient and fast compared to deep neural network approaches. Furthermore, the use of topological descriptors provides greater interpretability, as the extracted features are directly linked to the underlying structural characteristics of brain MRI rather than opaque latent representations.

However, in multi-temporal satellite images, prevalent shadows exhibit significant inconsistencies due to varying illumination conditions. To address this, we propose ShadowGS, a novel framework based on 3DGS. It leverages a physics-based rendering equation from remote sensing, combined with an efficient ray marching technique, to precisely model geometrically consistent shadows while maintaining efficient rendering. Additionally, it effectively disentangles different illumination components and apparent attributes in the scene. Furthermore, we introduce a shadow consistency constraint that significantly enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D reconstruction.

Our evaluation reveals that current models produce visually coherent videos with smooth motion and minimal flickering, yet their conceptual accuracy is less reliable. Performance in areas such as mechanics, fluids, and optics is encouraging, but models struggle with electromagnetism and thermodynamics, where abstract interactions are harder to depict.

Camera trap images provide a non-intrusive method for analyzing animal populations and identifying ecological patterns over time. However, manual analysis is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Deep learning, particularly foundation models, has been applied to automate wildlife identification, achieving strong performance when tested on data from the same geographical locations as their training sets. Yet, despite their promise, these models struggle to generalize to new geographical areas, leading to significant performance drops. For example, training an advanced vision-language model, such as CLIP with an adapter, on an African dataset achieves an accuracy of 84.77%. However, this performance drops significantly to 16.17% when the model is tested on an American dataset. This limitation partly arises because existing models rely predominantly on image-based representations, making them sensitive to geographical data distribution shifts, such as variation in background, lighting, and environmental conditions. To address this, we introduce WildIng, a Wildlife image Invariant representation model for geographical domain shift. WildIng integrates text descriptions with image features, creating a more robust representation to geographical domain shifts. By leveraging textual descriptions, our approach captures consistent semantic information, such as detailed descriptions of the appearance of the species, improving generalization across different geographical locations. Experiments show that WildIng enhances the accuracy of foundation models such as BioCLIP by 30% under geographical domain shift conditions.

However, existing RS VG datasets predominantly rely on explicit referring expressions-such as relative position, relative size, and color cues-thereby constraining performance on implicit VG tasks that require scenario-specific domain knowledge. This article introduces DVGBench, a high-quality implicit VG benchmark for drones, covering six major application scenarios: traffic, disaster, security, sport, social activity, and productive activity. Each object provides both explicit and implicit queries. Based on the dataset, we design DroneVG-R1, an LVLM that integrates the novel Implicit-to-Explicit Chain-of-Thought (I2E-CoT) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. This enables the model to take advantage of scene-specific expertise, converting implicit references into explicit ones and thus reducing grounding difficulty.

In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method.

Previous methods address these challenges through local alignment, yet they are often prone to shortcut learning and spurious correlations, yielding misalignment. Moreover, injecting prior knowledge can distort intra-modality structure. Motivated by our finding that encoder attention surfaces spatially precise evidence from the earliest training epochs, and to alleviate these issues, we introduceITSELF, an attention-guided framework for implicit local alignment. At its core, Guided Representation with Attentive Bank (GRAB) converts the model's own attention into an Attentive Bank of high-saliency tokens and applies local objectives on this bank, learning fine-grained correspondences without extra supervision. To make the selection reliable and non-redundant, we introduce Multi-Layer Attention for Robust Selection (MARS), which aggregates attention across layers and performs diversity-aware top-k selection; and Adaptive Token Scheduler (ATS), which schedules the retention budget from coarse to fine over training, preserving context early while progressively focusing on discriminative details. Extensive experiments on three widely used TBPS benchmarks showstate-of-the-art performance and strong cross-dataset generalization, confirming the effectiveness and robustness of our approach without additional prior supervision.

This exclusion arises from the inherent ill-posed nature of 3D estimation from monocular image, which introduces instability during training. Consequently, high-quality 3D predictions can be erroneously suppressed by 2D-only matching criteria, leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose Mono3DV, a novel Transformer-based framework. Our approach introduces three key innovations. First, we develop a 3D-Aware Bipartite Matching strategy that directly incorporates 3D geometric information into the matching cost, resolving the misalignment caused by purely 2D criteria. Second, it is important to stabilize the Bipartite Matching to resolve the instability occurring when integrating 3D attributes. Therefore, we propose 3D-DeNoising scheme in the training phase. Finally, recognizing the gradient vanishing issue associated with conventional denoising techniques, we propose a novel Variational Query DeNoising mechanism to overcome this limitation, which significantly enhances model performance.

The root cause lies in the high diversity of artifact distributions introduced by different forgery methods, while pretrained models tend to disrupt their original general semantic structures when adapting to new artifacts. Existing approaches usually rely on indiscriminate global parameter updates or introduce additional supervision signals, making it difficult to effectively model diverse forgery artifacts while preserving semantic stability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a deepfake detection method based on Multi-Artifact Subspaces and selective layer masks (MASM), which explicitly decouples semantic representations from artifact representations and constrains the fitting strength of artifact subspaces, thereby improving generalization robustness in cross-dataset scenarios. Specifically, MASM applies singular value decomposition to model weights, partitioning pretrained weights into a stable semantic principal subspace and multiple learnable artifact subspaces. This design enables decoupled modeling of different forgery artifact patterns while preserving the general semantic subspace. On this basis, a selective layer mask strategy is introduced to adaptively regulate the update behavior of corresponding network layers according to the learning state of each artifact subspace, suppressing overfitting to any single forgery characteristic. Furthermore, orthogonality constraints and spectral consistency constraints are imposed to jointly regularize multiple artifact subspaces, guiding them to learn complementary and diverse artifact representations while maintaining a stable overall spectral structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMASM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u7528\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4f2a\u9020\u5de5\u4ef6\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u8c03\u8282\u5c42\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u6b63\u4ea4\u4e0e\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e0d\u540c\u4f2a\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5de5\u4ef6\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5de5\u4ef6\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u505aSVD\uff0c\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u4ef6\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u5404\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5c42\u63a9\u7801\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5c42\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b\u5bf9\u5de5\u4ef6\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8c31\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u80fd\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e00\u4f2a\u9020\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u8bba\u6587\u6458\u8981\u4e2d\u672a\u7ed9\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u503c\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MASM\u901a\u8fc7\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u4fc3\u4f7f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5de5\u4ef6\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u4f2a\u9020\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Although transfer learning is commonly used for predicting body weight from images, its effectiveness and optimal fine-tuning strategies remain poorly understood in livestock applications, particularly beyond the use of pretrained ImageNet or COCO weights. In addition, while both depth images and three-dimensional point-cloud data have been explored for body weight prediction, direct comparisons of these two modalities in dairy cattle are limited. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate whether transfer learning from a large farm enhances body weight prediction on a small farm with limited data, and 2) compare the predictive performance of depth-image- and point-cloud-based approaches under three experimental designs. Top-view depth images and point-cloud data were collected from 1,201, 215, and 58 cows at large, medium, and small dairy farms, respectively. Four deep learning models were evaluated: ConvNeXt and MobileViT for depth images, and PointNet and DGCNN for point clouds. Transfer learning markedly improved body weight prediction on the small farm across all four models, outperforming single-source learning and achieving gains comparable to or greater than joint learning. These results indicate that pretrained representations generalize well across farms with differing imaging conditions and dairy cattle populations. No consistent performance difference was observed between depth-image- and point-cloud-based models. Overall, these findings suggest that transfer learning is well suited for small farm prediction scenarios where cross-farm data sharing is limited by privacy, logistical, or policy constraints, as it requires access only to pretrained model weights rather than raw data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u5c0f\u519c\u573a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u53ea\u9700\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u800c\u9002\u5408\u9690\u79c1/\u653f\u7b56\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8de8\u519c\u573a\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u5728\u7272\u755c\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u6700\u4f73\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8eImageNet/COCO\u65f6\uff1b\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u5927\u3001\u4e2d\u3001\u5c0f\u4e09\u79cd\u89c4\u6a21\u5976\u725b\u573a\u91c7\u96c6\u9876\u89c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ConvNeXt\u3001MobileViT\u5904\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0cPointNet\u4e0eDGCNN\u5904\u7406\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e09\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u519c\u573a\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6e90\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u5373\u53ef\u5e26\u6765\u8de8\u519c\u573a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u65e0\u7a33\u5b9a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u91cd\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u578b\u519c\u573a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4e14\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u519c\u573a\u4e0e\u6210\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, efficiently reconstructing hyperspectral images from compressive sensing measurements presents significant challenges. To tackle these, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that capitalizes on the unique spectral and spatial characteristics of hyperspectral images. We introduce the Lightweight Separate Spectral Transformer (LSST), an innovative architecture tailored for efficient hyperspectral image reconstruction. This architecture consists of Separate Spectral Transformer Blocks (SSTB) for modeling spectral relationships and Lightweight Spatial Convolution Blocks (LSCB) for spatial processing. The SSTB employs Grouped Spectral Self-attention and a Spectrum Shuffle operation to effectively manage both local and non-local spectral relationships. Simultaneously, the LSCB utilizes depth-wise separable convolutions and strategic ordering to enhance spatial information processing. Furthermore, we implement the Focal Spectrum Loss, a novel loss weighting mechanism that dynamically adjusts during training to improve reconstruction across spectrally complex bands. Extensive testing demonstrates that our LSST achieves superior performance while requiring fewer FLOPs and parameters, underscoring its efficiency and effectiveness.

Our approach is built upon a novel watermark definition that leverages patch-level luminance statistics. Specifically, the service provider predefines a binary pattern together with corresponding patch-level thresholds. To detect a watermark in a given image, we evaluate whether the luminance of each patch surpasses its threshold and then verify whether the resulting binary pattern aligns with the target one. A simple statistical analysis demonstrates that the false positive rate of the proposed method can be effectively controlled, thereby ensuring certified detection. To enable seamless watermark injection across different paradigms, we leverage the widely adopted guidance technique as a plug-and-play mechanism and develop the \\emph{watermark guidance}. This design enables Luminark to achieve generality across state-of-the-art generative models without compromising image quality. Empirically, we evaluate our approach on nine models spanning diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid frameworks.

True narrative understanding requires grounding who is doing what, when, and where, maintaining coherent entity representations across dynamic visual and temporal contexts. We introduce NarrativeTrack, the first benchmark to evaluate narrative understanding in MLLMs through fine-grained entity-centric reasoning. Unlike existing benchmarks limited to short clips or coarse scene-level semantics, we decompose videos into constituent entities and examine their continuity via a Compositional Reasoning Progression (CRP), a structured evaluation framework that progressively increases narrative complexity across three dimensions: entity existence, entity changes, and entity ambiguity. CRP challenges models to advance from temporal persistence to contextual evolution and fine-grained perceptual reasoning. A fully automated entity-centric pipeline enables scalable extraction of temporally grounded entity representations, providing the foundation for CRP. Evaluations of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that models fail to robustly track entities across visual transitions and temporal dynamics, often hallucinating identity under context shifts. Open-source general-purpose MLLMs exhibit strong perceptual grounding but weak temporal coherence, while video-specific MLLMs capture temporal context yet hallucinate entity's contexts.

The proposed model introduces (i) a combined loss term aligning the global color statistics through differentiable histogram matching, perceptual image quality measure, and feature based similarity to preserve texture information, (ii) local hue-saturation priors injected via Spatially Adaptive Denormalization (SPADE) to stabilize chromatic reconstruction, and (iii) texture-aware supervision within a Mamba backbone to preserve fine details. We introduce an adaptive-resolution inference engine that further enables high-resolution translation without sacrificing quality. Our proposed NIR-to-RGB translation model simultaneously enforces global color statistics and local chromatic consistency, while scaling to native resolutions without compromising texture fidelity or generalization. Extensive evaluations on FANVID, OMSIV, VCIP2020, and RGB2NIR using different evaluation metrics demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baseline methods. HAQAGen produces images with sharper textures, natural colors, attaining significant gains as per perceptual metrics.

Current coordinate-guided low-resolution feature interpolation methods, e.g., bilinear interpolation, produce coarse high-resolution features which suffer from feature misalignment and insufficient context information. Moreover, enriching semantics to high-resolution features requires a high computation burden, so that it is challenging to meet the requirement of lowlatency inference. We propose a novel Guided Attentive Interpolation (GAI) method to adaptively interpolate fine-grained high-resolution features with semantic features to tackle these issues. Guided Attentive Interpolation determines both spatial and semantic relations of pixels from features of different resolutions and then leverages these relations to interpolate high-resolution features with rich semantics. GAI can be integrated with any deep convolutional network for efficient semantic segmentation.

Current echocardiography-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) models focus primarily on binary HFpEF detection in humans and do not provide comorbidity-specific phenotyping or temporal estimates of disease progression towards decompensation. We aimed to develop a unified AI framework, CardioMOD-Net, to perform multiclass diagnosis and continuous prediction of HFpEF onset directly from standard echocardiography cine loops in preclinical models.\n  Methods: Mouse echocardiography videos from four groups were used: control (CTL), hyperglycaemic (HG), obesity (OB), and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). Two-dimensional parasternal long-axis cine loops were decomposed using Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to extract temporal features for downstream analysis. A shared latent representation supported Vision Transformers, one for a classifier for diagnosis and another for a regression module for predicting the age at HFpEF onset.\n  Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy across the four groups was 65%, with all classes exceeding 50% accuracy. Misclassifications primarily reflected early-stage overlap between OB or SAH and CTL. The prognostic module achieved a root-mean-square error of 21.72 weeks for time-to-HFpEF prediction, with OB and SAH showing the most accurate estimates. Predicted HFpEF onset closely matched true distributions in all groups.\n  Discussion: This unified framework demonstrates that multiclass phenotyping and continuous HFpEF onset prediction can be obtained from a single cine loop, even under small-data conditions.

It extends Video Crowd Counting (VCC) beyond the per-frame pedestrian count. In contrast to VCC that learns to count pedestrians across frames, VIC must identify co-existent pedestrians between frames, which turns out to be a correspondence problem. Existing VIC approaches, however, can underperform in congested scenes such as metro commuting. To address this, we build WuhanMetroCrowd, one of the first VIC datasets that characterize crowded, dynamic pedestrian flows. It features sparse-to-dense density levels, short-to-long video clips, slow-to-fast flow variations, front-to-back appearance changes, and light-to-heavy occlusions. To better adapt VIC approaches to crowds, we rethink the nature of VIC and recognize two informative priors: i) the social grouping prior that indicates pedestrians tend to gather in groups and ii) the spatial-temporal displacement prior that informs an individual cannot teleport physically. The former inspires us to relax the standard one-to-one (O2O) matching used by VIC to one-to-many (O2M) matching, implemented by an implicit context generator and a O2M matcher; the latter facilitates the design of a displacement prior injector, which strengthens not only O2M matching but also feature extraction and model training. These designs jointly form a novel and strong VIC baseline OMAN++. Extensive experiments show that OMAN++ not only outperforms state-of-the-art VIC baselines on the standard SenseCrowd, CroHD, and MovingDroneCrowd benchmarks, but also indicates a clear advantage in crowded scenes, with a 38.12% error reduction on our WuhanMetroCrowd dataset.

To tackle this, we propose the Multi-scale Implicit Structural Similarity Measurement (MS-ISSM). Unlike traditional point-to-point matching, MS-ISSM utilizes Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to represent local features continuously, transforming distortion measurement into a comparison of implicit function coefficients. This approach effectively circumvents matching errors inherent in irregular data. Additionally, we propose a ResGrouped-MLP quality assessment network, which robustly maps multi-scale feature differences to perceptual scores. The network architecture departs from traditional flat MLPs by adopting a grouped encoding strategy integrated with Residual Blocks and Channel-wise Attention mechanisms. This hierarchical design allows the model to preserve the distinct physical semantics of luma, chroma, and geometry while adaptively focusing on the most salient distortion features across High, Medium, and Low scales.

Unlike SISR, Reference-based Super-Resolution (RefSR) leverages an additional high-resolution reference image to facilitate the recovery of high-frequency textures. However, existing research mainly focuses on backdoor attacks targeting RefSR, while the vulnerability of the adversarial attacks targeting RefSR has not been fully explored. To fill this research gap, we propose RefSR-Adv, an adversarial attack that degrades SR outputs by perturbing only the reference image. By maximizing the difference between adversarial and clean outputs, RefSR-Adv induces significant performance degradation and generates severe artifacts across CNN, Transformer, and Mamba architectures on the CUFED5, WR-SR, and DRefSR datasets. Importantly, experiments confirm a positive correlation between the similarity of the low-resolution input and the reference image and attack effectiveness, revealing that the model's over-reliance on reference features is a key security flaw.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery from Sentinel-1 can be effectively used for this task, but training an effective detection model requires gathering a large dataset with high-quality annotations from domain experts, which is prohibitively time-consuming. In this work, we aim to facilitate and accelerate the annotation of SAR images for avalanche mapping. We build on the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a segmentation foundation model trained on natural images, and tailor it to Sentinel-1 SAR data. Adapting SAM to our use-case requires addressing several domain-specific challenges: (i) domain mismatch, since SAM was not trained on satellite/SAR imagery; (ii) input adaptation, because SAR products typically provide more than three channels, while SAM is constrained to RGB images; (iii) robustness to imprecise prompts that can affect target identification and degrade the segmentation quality, an issue exacerbated in small, low-contrast avalanches; and (iv) training efficiency, since standard fine-tuning is computationally demanding for SAM. We tackle these challenges through a combination of adapters to mitigate the domain gap, multiple encoders to handle multi-channel SAR inputs, prompt-engineering strategies to improve avalanche localization accuracy, and a training algorithm that limits the training time of the encoder, which is recognized as the major bottleneck.

A key challenge in this domain is the scarcity of large-scale, annotated real-world data, forcing a reliance on synthetic datasets. This reliance introduces a significant sim-to-real domain gap, leading to poor generalization, low-fidelity human geometry, and poor alignment on in-the-wild videos. To address this, we propose an innovative training paradigm that effectively leverages unlabeled in-the-wild data. Our framework bridges strong, disparate priors from scene reconstruction and HMR, and is trained with two core components: (1) a robust distillation strategy to refine human surface details by distilling high-frequency details from an expert depth model, and (2) a two-stage supervision scheme, which first learns coarse localization on synthetic data, then fine-tunes on real data by directly optimizing the geometric correspondence between the SMPL mesh and the human point cloud. This approach enables our feed-forward model to jointly recover high-fidelity scene geometry, human point clouds, camera parameters, and coherent, metric-scale SMPL bodies, all in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on human-centric scene reconstruction and delivers highly competitive results on global human motion estimation, comparing favorably against both optimization-based frameworks and HMR-only methods.

The resulting training objective serves as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information (MI) between slots and inputs, strengthening slot representation quality. On both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO), CODA improves object discovery (e.g., +6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation over strong baselines. Register slots add negligible overhead, keeping CODA efficient and scalable. These results indicate potential applications of CODA as an effective framework for robust OCL in complex, real-world scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "CODA adds register slots and contrastive loss to improve slot-image alignment and reduce entanglement, boosting OCL performance", "motivation": "explain why proposed approach helps slot attention issues", "method": "analysis of method", "result": "improved FG-ARI etc", "conclusion": "CODA is efficient and effective for real-world OCL"}}

State-of-the-art methods typically assign each training sample a positive and a negative weight, optimizing the assignment scheme during training. However, these strategies often assign an insufficient number of positive samples to small objects, leading to a scale imbalance during training. To address this limitation, we introduce RFAssigner, a novel assignment strategy designed to enhance the multi-scale learning capabilities of dense detectors. RFAssigner first establishes an initial set of positive samples using a point-based prior. It then leverages a Gaussian Receptive Field (GRF) distance to measure the similarity between the GRFs of unassigned candidate locations and the ground-truth objects. Based on this metric, RFAssigner adaptively selects supplementary positive samples from the unassigned pool, promoting a more balanced learning process across object scales. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets with distinct object scale distributions validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.

To address this, we propose an LLM-based MambaFormer hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for efficient medical question-answering (QA) and clinical assistance. The MambaFormer employs a lightweight gating mechanism that performs token-level dynamic routing to a customized Transformer expert (ET5) for short, complex queries or to a State Space Model expert (EMamba) for long, high-throughput sequences. The customized EMamba and ET5 models are tailored to accommodate input sequence dimensionality, embedding structure, sequence length, and target-specific output heads, and are fine-tuned through transfer learning on a new, custom-designed DentalQA dataset. Moreover, intelligent routing decisions are driven by the contextual complexity of token embeddings, normalized sequence length, and domain-aware features, thereby enforcing a Pareto-optimal trade-off between inference latency and prediction accuracy. Furthermore, a novel utility-guided multi-objective loss jointly optimizes decisions, router parameters, routing behavior, expert utilization, and computational cost by adaptively regulating token-level expert activation. Finally, the proposed MambaFormer is cross-validated (holdout) for medical QA on the new, custom-designed DentalQA and PubMedQA datasets and compared with state-of-the-art techniques.

VReID-XFD is derived from the DetReIDX dataset and comprises 371 identities, 11,288 tracklets, and 11.75 million frames, captured across altitudes from 5.8 m to 120 m, viewing angles from oblique (30 degrees) to nadir (90 degrees), and horizontal distances up to 120 m. The benchmark supports aerial-to-aerial, aerial-to-ground, and ground-to-aerial evaluation under strict identity-disjoint splits, with rich physical metadata. The VReID-XFD-25 Challenge attracted 10 teams with hundreds of submissions. Systematic analysis reveals monotonic performance degradation with altitude and distance, a universal disadvantage of nadir views, and a trade-off between peak performance and robustness.

Jha"], "title": "LinMU: Multimodal Understanding Made Linear", "comment": "23 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve impressive performance but are limited by the quadratic complexity of self-attention, which prevents their deployment on edge devices and makes their understanding of high-resolution images and long-context videos prohibitively expensive. To address this challenge, we introduce LinMU (Linear-complexity Multimodal Understanding), a VLM design that achieves linear complexity without using any quadratic-complexity modules while maintaining the performance of global-attention-based VLMs. LinMU replaces every self-attention layer in the VLM with the M-MATE block: a dual-branch module that combines a bidirectional state-space model for global context (Flex-MA branch) with localized Swin-style window attention (Local-Swin branch) for adjacent correlations. To transform a pre-trained VLM into the LinMU architecture, we propose a three-stage distillation framework that (i) initializes both branches with self-attention weights and trains the Flex-MA branch alone, (ii) unfreezes the Local-Swin branch and fine-tunes it jointly with the Flex-MA branch, and (iii) unfreezes the remaining blocks and fine-tunes them using LoRA adapters, while regressing on hidden states and token-level logits of the frozen VLM teacher. On MMMU, TextVQA, LongVideoBench, Video-MME, and other benchmarks, LinMU matches the performance of teacher models, yet reduces Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by up to 2.7$\\times$ and improves token throughput by up to 9.0$\\times$ on minute-length videos. Ablations confirm the importance of each distillation stage and the necessity of the two branches of the M-MATE block.

Existing methods, mainly based on reducing neural decoding to generation tasks or simple correlations, fail to reflect the hierarchical and temporal processes of visual processing in the brain. To address these limitations, we present NeuroAlign, a novel framework for fine-grained fMRI-video alignment inspired by the hierarchical organization of the human visual system. Our framework implements a two-stage mechanism that mirrors biological visual pathways: global semantic understanding through Neural-Temporal Contrastive Learning (NTCL) and fine-grained pattern matching through enhanced vector quantization. NTCL explicitly models temporal dynamics through bidirectional prediction between modalities, while our DynaSyncMM-EMA approach enables dynamic multi-modal fusion with adaptive weighting.

Conditioning on a single image completely ignores the temporal signature, which leads to pose-locked motions, unnatural warping, and \"average\" faces when viewpoints and expressions change. To this end, we introduce an identity-conditioned variant of a diffusion-transformer video generator which uses a short reference video rather than a single portrait. Our key idea is to incorporate the dynamics in the reference. A short clip reveals subject-specific patterns, e.g., how smiles form, across poses and lighting. From this clip, a Sinkhorn-routed encoder learns compact identity tokens that capture characteristic dynamics while remaining pretrained backbone-compatible. Despite adding only lightweight conditioning, the approach consistently improves identity retention under large pose changes and expressive facial behavior, while maintaining prompt faithfulness and visual realism across diverse subjects and prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528\u77ed\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8eab\u4efdtokens\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Sinkhorn\u8def\u7531\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6761\u4ef6\u878d\u5165\u6269\u6563-Transformer\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5927\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u51fa\u73b0\u59ff\u6001\u9501\u5b9a\u3001\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u4eba\u8138\uff1b\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u5305\u542b\u4e2a\u4f53\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u5fae\u7b11\u65b9\u5f0f\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563-Transformer\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Sinkhorn\u8def\u7531\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u52a8\u6001tokens\uff0c\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3b\u5e72\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u5e76\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6761\u4ef6\u52a0\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4e3b\u4f53\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5bcc\u8868\u60c5\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7528\u77ed\u53c2\u8003\u89c6\u9891\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u8eab\u4efd\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u53c2\u8003\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\u60c5\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002"}}

However, ReID faces significant challenges such as appearance variations, domain shifts, and limited labeled data. This dissertation proposes three advanced approaches to enhance ReID performance under supervised, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), and fully unsupervised settings. First, SCM-ReID integrates supervised contrastive learning with hybrid loss optimization (classification, center, triplet, and centroid-triplet losses), improving discriminative feature representation and achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on Market-1501 and CUHK03 datasets. Second, for UDA, IQAGA and DAPRH combine GAN-based image augmentation, domain-invariant mapping, and pseudo-label refinement to mitigate domain discrepancies and enhance cross-domain generalization. Experiments demonstrate substantial gains over baseline methods, with mAP and Rank-1 improvements up to 12% in challenging transfer scenarios. Finally, ViTC-UReID leverages Vision Transformer-based feature encoding and camera-aware proxy learning to boost unsupervised ReID.

Embedding IMUs into loose-fitting garments is a desirable alternative, yet sensor-body displacement introduces severe, structured, and location-dependent corruption that breaks standard inertial pipelines. We propose GID (Garment Inertial Denoiser), a lightweight, plug-and-play Transformer that factorizes loose-wear MoCap into three stages: (i) location-specific denoising, (ii) adaptive cross-wear fusion, and (iii) general pose prediction. GID uses a location-aware expert architecture, where a shared spatio-temporal backbone models global motion while per-IMU expert heads specialize in local garment dynamics, and a lightweight fusion module ensures cross-part consistency. This inductive bias enables stable training and effective learning from limited paired loose-tight IMU data. We also introduce GarMoCap, a combined public and newly collected dataset covering diverse users, motions, and garments. Experiments show that GID enables accurate, real-time denoising from single-user training and generalizes across unseen users, motions, and garment types, consistently improving state-of-the-art inertial MoCap methods when used as a drop-in module.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGID\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4Transformer\uff0c\u7528\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u5206\u5934+\u8de8\u90e8\u4f4d\u878d\u5408+\u901a\u7528\u59ff\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u53bb\u566a\u677e\u6563\u8863\u7269\u4e2dIMU\u7684\u4f4d\u79fb\u4f2a\u5f71\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9bGarMoCap\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5355\u7528\u6237\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u5b9e\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u5c06IMU\u5d4c\u5165\u5bbd\u677e\u8863\u7269\u65f6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u76f8\u5bf9\u8eab\u4f53\u4f4d\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u76f8\u5173\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u56e0\u7d27\u8d34\u5f0f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5bf9\u65e5\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u800c\u8a00\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5728\u5bbd\u677e\u670d\u9970\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u786eMoCap\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7279\u5b9a\u53bb\u566a\uff08\u6bcf\u4e2aIMU\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e13\u5bb6\u5934\u5b66\u4e60\u5c40\u90e8\u670d\u88c5\u52a8\u6001\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8de8\u90e8\u4f4d\u878d\u5408\uff08\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u5757\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u3001\u901a\u7528\u59ff\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\uff08\u5171\u4eab\u65f6\u7a7a\u9aa8\u5e72\u63d0\u53d6\u5168\u5c40\u8fd0\u52a8\uff09\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u677e\u7d27IMU\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "GID (Garment Inertial Denoiser) introduces a transformer-based denoiser that corrects garment-induced IMU noise, using location-specific expert heads, spatio-temporal backbone, and fusion module; trained on GarMoCap dataset; improves downstream inertial MoCap methods and generalizes across users/motions/garments.", "conclusion": "GID\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u677e\u8863\u7740\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684IMU\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u60ef\u6027MoCap\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u7528\u6237/\u52a8\u4f5c/\u670d\u88c5\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73b0\u6709\u60ef\u6027\u7ba1\u7ebf\u7684drop-in\u6a21\u5757\u3002"}}

This morphology can be regarded as an SE(3)-invariant, denoised volumetric representation of subvolumes extracted from tomograms. Inferring morphology is therefore an inverse problem of estimating both a template morphology and its SE(3) transformation. Existing expectation-maximization based solution to this problem often misses rare but important morphologies and requires extensive manual hyperparameter tuning. Addressing this issue, we present a disentangled deep representation learning framework that separates SE(3) transformations from morphological content in the representation space. The framework includes a novel multi-choice learning module that enables this disentanglement for highly noisy cryo-ET data, and the learned morphological content is used to generate template morphologies.

However, existing works focus on 2D parking slot perception, mapping, and localization, 3D reconstruction remains underexplored, which is crucial for capturing complex spatial geometry in parking scenarios. Naively improving the visual quality of reconstructed parking scenes does not directly benefit autonomous parking, as the key entry point for parking is the slots perception module. To address these limitations, we curate the first benchmark named ParkRecon3D, specifically designed for parking scene reconstruction. It includes sensor data from four surround-view fisheye cameras with calibrated extrinsics and dense parking slot annotations. We then propose ParkGaussian, the first framework that integrates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for parking scene reconstruction. To further improve the alignment between reconstruction and downstream parking slot detection, we introduce a slot-aware reconstruction strategy that leverages existing parking perception methods to enhance the synthesis quality of slot regions. Experiments on ParkRecon3D demonstrate that ParkGaussian achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and better preserves perception consistency for downstream tasks.

This work introduces SwinIFS, a landmark-guided super-resolution framework that integrates structural priors with hierarchical attention mechanisms to achieve identity-preserving reconstruction at both moderate and extreme upscaling factors. The method incorporates dense Gaussian heatmaps of key facial landmarks into the input representation, enabling the network to focus on semantically important facial regions from the earliest stages of processing. A compact Swin Transformer backbone is employed to capture long-range contextual information while preserving local geometry, allowing the model to restore subtle facial textures and maintain global structural consistency. Extensive experiments on the CelebA benchmark demonstrate that SwinIFS achieves superior perceptual quality, sharper reconstructions, and improved identity retention; it consistently produces more photorealistic results and exhibits strong performance even under 8x magnification, where most methods fail to recover meaningful structure. SwinIFS also provides an advantageous balance between reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications in facial enhancement, surveillance, and digital restoration.

Existing methods utilize global depth regularization to mitigate artifacts, leading to the loss of geometric boundary details. To address this problem, we propose EdgeNeRF, an edge-guided sparse-view 3D reconstruction algorithm. Our method leverages the prior that abrupt changes in depth and normals generate edges. Specifically, we first extract edges from input images, then apply depth and normal regularization constraints to non-edge regions, enhancing geometric consistency while preserving high-frequency details at boundaries. Experiments on LLFF and DTU datasets demonstrate EdgeNeRF's superior performance, particularly in retaining sharp geometric boundaries and suppressing artifacts. Additionally, the proposed edge-guided depth regularization module can be seamlessly integrated into other methods in a plug-and-play manner, significantly improving their performance without substantially increasing training time.

Existing methods attempt to address both tasks within a single unified stage. We question this design, as the annotation imbalance between known and unknown classes often leads to negative transfer of known classes and underfitting for unknowns. To overcome these issues, we propose SATS, a Separating-then-Adapting Training Strategy, which addresses OSDA-SS through two sequential steps: known/unknown separation and unknown-aware domain adaptation. By providing the model with more accurate and well-aligned unknown classes, our method ensures a balanced learning of discriminative features for both known and unknown classes, steering the model toward discovering truly unknown objects. Additionally, we present hard unknown exploration, an innovative data augmentation method that exposes the model to more challenging unknowns, strengthening its ability to capture more comprehensive understanding of target unknowns. We evaluate our method on public OSDA-SS benchmarks.

With 100 annotated images per category, totaling 100K images, PIN++ represents the most comprehensive dataset covering a diverse range of object categories. Leveraging PIN++, we propose a Multi-scale Part-supervised recognition Model (MPM) for robust classification on ImageNet-1K. We first trained a part segmentation network using PIN++ and used it to generate pseudo part labels for the remaining unannotated images. MPM then integrated a conventional recognition architecture with auxiliary bypass layers, jointly supervised by both pseudo part labels and the original part annotations.

To achieve this, we propose a Parallel Expert Refinement module to generate each modal correlation.

However, a common challenge arises when working with medical images generated by different systems or even the same system with different parameter settings. Such images contain diverse textures and reverberation noise that violate the aforementioned assumption. Consequently, models trained on data from one device or setting often struggle to perform effectively with data from other devices or settings. In addition, retraining models for each specific device or setting is labor-intensive and costly. To address these issues in ultrasound images, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model. We formulated the domain adaptation tasks as an image-to-image translation task, in which we modified the texture patterns and removed reverberation noise in the test data images from the source domain to align with those in the target domain images while keeping the image content unchanged. We applied the proposed method to two datasets containing carotid ultrasound images from three different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully translated the texture pattern of images and removed reverberation noise from the ultrasound images. Furthermore, we evaluated the CycleGAN approaches for a comparative study with the proposed model. The experimental findings conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model achieved domain adaptation (histogram correlation (0.960 (0.019), & 0.920 (0.043) and bhattacharya distance (0.040 (0.020), & 0.085 (0.048)), compared to no adaptation (0.916 (0.062) & 0.890 (0.077), 0.090 (0.070) & 0.121 (0.095)) for both datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eGAN\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u53bb\u9664\u6df7\u54cd\u566a\u58f0\u4f7f\u6e90\u57df\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u7ec4\u9888\u52a8\u8109\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8eCycleGAN\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "Different ultrasound devices/settings produce images with varying textures and reverberation noise, breaking training-test distribution assumption and hurting model performance; retraining per device is costly.", "method": "GAN-based domain adaptation for ultrasound", "result": "Proposed GAN translates test images' texture and removes reverberation noise to match target domain while preserving content; applied to two carotid ultrasound datasets from three domains; outperforms no adaptation and compared with CycleGAN.", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u53d8\u7eb9\u7406\u5e76\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76f4\u65b9\u56fe\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4e0e\u964d\u4f4eBhattacharyya\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u9002\u5e94\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

We propose Advantage Decoupled Preference Optimization (ADPO), a unified reinforcement learning framework that jointly learns answer generation and self-verification within a single policy. ADPO introduces two innovations: a preference verification reward improving verification capability and a decoupled optimization mechanism enabling synergistic optimization of generation and verification.

AD, the primary driver of dementia, manifests through progressive cognitive and neuroanatomical changes like atrophy and ventricular expansion, making robust, generalizable classification essential for real-world use. While convolutional neural networks and transformers have advanced feature extraction via attention and fusion techniques, single-domain generalization (SDG) remains underexplored yet critical, given the fragmented nature of AD datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce Extended MixStyle (EM), a framework for blending higher-order feature moments (skewness and kurtosis) to mimic diverse distributional variations. Trained on sMRI data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; n=4,647) to differentiate persons with normal cognition (NC) from those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD and tested on three unseen cohorts (total n=3,126), EM yields enhanced cross-domain performance, improving macro-F1 on average by 2.4 percentage points over state-of-the-art SDG benchmarks, underscoring its promise for invariant, reliable AD detection in heterogeneous real-world settings.

At present, diffusion inversion still remains a challenging task due to the lack of viable supervision signals. Thus, most existing methods resort to approximation-based solutions, which however are often at the cost of performance or efficiency. To remedy these shortcomings, we propose a novel self-supervised diffusion inversion approach in this paper, termed Deep Inversion (DeepInv). Instead of requiring ground-truth noise annotations, we introduce a self-supervised objective as well as a data augmentation strategy to generate high-quality pseudo noises from real images without manual intervention. Based on these two innovative designs, DeepInv is also equipped with an iterative and multi-scale training regime to train a parameterized inversion solver, thereby achieving the fast and accurate image-to-noise mapping. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt of presenting a trainable solver to predict inversion noise step by step. The extensive experiments show that our DeepInv can achieve much better performance and inference speed than the compared methods, e.g., +40.435% SSIM than EasyInv and +9887.5% speed than ReNoise on COCO dataset. Moreover, our careful designs of trainable solvers can also provide insights to the community.

Then, a deep teacher network extracts robust features from both original and synthetic data. Finally, a compact student network learns from the teacher via knowledge distillation, balancing generalization and computational efficiency.\n  Evaluated on a multi-center dataset of 1,435 cases, the synthetic images were of good quality.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a promising solution, but current methods remain inefficient and often fail to maintain high answer quality. To address these challenges, we propose VideoSpeculateRAG, an efficient VLM-based RAG framework built on two key ideas. First, we introduce a speculative decoding pipeline: a lightweight draft model quickly generates multiple answer candidates, which are then verified and refined by a more accurate heavyweight model, substantially reducing inference latency without sacrificing correctness.

In this paper, we propose BARE, a bias-aware and reasoning-enhanced framework for one-tower visual grounding. BARE introduces a mechanism that preserves modality-specific features and constructs referential semantics through three novel modules: (i) language salience modulator, (ii) visual bias correction and (iii) referential relationship enhancement, which jointly mitigate multimodal distractions and enhance referential comprehension.

In autonomous driving, this vision gives rise to driving world models: generative simulators that imagine ego and agent futures, enabling scalable simulation, safe testing of corner cases, and rich synthetic data generation. Yet, despite fast-growing research activity, the field lacks a rigorous benchmark to measure progress and guide priorities. Existing evaluations remain limited: generic video metrics overlook safety-critical imaging factors; trajectory plausibility is rarely quantified; temporal and agent-level consistency is neglected; and controllability with respect to ego conditioning is ignored. Moreover, current datasets fail to cover the diversity of conditions required for real-world deployment. To address these gaps, we present DrivingGen, the first comprehensive benchmark for generative driving world models. DrivingGen combines a diverse evaluation dataset curated from both driving datasets and internet-scale video sources, spanning varied weather, time of day, geographic regions, and complex maneuvers, with a suite of new metrics that jointly assess visual realism, trajectory plausibility, temporal coherence, and controllability. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art models reveals clear trade-offs: general models look better but break physics, while driving-specific ones capture motion realistically but lag in visual quality.

This flexible tokenization is typically achieved through nested dropout, where a portion of trailing tokens is randomly truncated during training, and the image is reconstructed using the remaining preceding sequence.

To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ReToK}, a flexible tokenizer with \\underline{Re}dundant \\underline{Tok}en Padding and Hierarchical Semantic Regularization, designed to fully exploit all tokens for enhanced latent modeling. Specifically, we introduce \\textbf{Redundant Token Padding} to activate tail tokens more frequently, thereby alleviating information over-concentration in the early tokens. In addition, we apply \\textbf{Hierarchical Semantic Regularization} to align the decoding features of earlier tokens with those from a pre-trained vision foundation model, while progressively reducing the regularization strength toward the tail to allow finer low-level detail reconstruction.

Traditional MTN methods create shared low-level modules and distinct high-level modules, causing an exponential increase in model parameters with the addition of tasks. This approach also limits feature interaction at the high level, hindering the exploration of semantic relations among attributes, thereby affecting generalization negatively. In response, this study introduces FAR-AMTN, a novel Attention Multi-Task Network for FAR. It incorporates a Weight-Shared Group-Specific Attention (WSGSA) module with shared parameters to minimize complexity while improving group feature representation.

This challenge persists in automated Few-shot Font Generation (FFG), where models often struggle to preserve both the structural integrity and stylistic fidelity from limited references.

Moreover, existing FFG methods remain within the image-to-image paradigm, relying solely on visual references and overlooking the role of language in conveying stylistic intent during font design. To address these limitations, we propose GAR-Font, a novel AR framework for multimodal few-shot font generation.

Recent works have leveraged the inherent redundancy in visual content to make training more affordable by training only on a subset of visual information. While these methods were successful in providing cheaper and more effective training, sparsely trained diffusion models struggle in inference. This is due to their lacking response to Classifier-free Guidance (CFG) leading to underwhelming performance during inference. To overcome this, we propose Sparse Guidance (SG). Instead of using conditional dropout as a signal to guide diffusion models, SG uses token-level sparsity. As a result, SG preserves the high-variance of the conditional prediction better, achieving good quality and high variance outputs. Leveraging token-level sparsity at inference, SG improves fidelity at lower compute, achieving 1.58 FID on the commonly used ImageNet-256 benchmark with 25% fewer FLOPs, and yields up to 58% FLOP savings at matched baseline quality.

While such prompts can embed prior knowledge about diagnostic quality, they often introduce bias by reflecting idealized definitions that may not hold under real-world degradations such as noise, motion artifacts, or scanner variability. To address this, we propose the Context-Aware Prompt-guided Image Quality Assessment (CAP-IQA) framework, which integrates text-level priors with instance-level context prompts and applies causal debiasing to separate idealized knowledge from factual, image-specific degradations. Our framework combines a CNN-based visual encoder with a domain-specific text encoder to assess diagnostic visibility, anatomical clarity, and noise perception in abdominal CT images. The model leverages radiology-style prompts and context-aware fusion to align semantic and perceptual representations. On the 2023 LDCTIQA challenge benchmark, CAP-IQA achieves an overall correlation score of 2.8590 (sum of PLCC, SROCC, and KROCC), surpassing the top-ranked leaderboard team (2.7427) by 4.24%. Moreover, our comprehensive ablation experiments confirm that prompt-guided fusion and the simplified encoder-only design jointly enhance feature alignment and interpretability.

This work presents a systematic empirical study of three weakly calibrated monocular strategies: landmark-based geometry, pose-driven regression, and object-calibrated silhouettes, evaluated under semi-constrained conditions using consumer-grade cameras. Rather than pursuing state-of-the-art accuracy, the study analyzes how differing calibration assumptions influence measurement behavior, robustness, and failure modes across varied body types. The results reveal a clear trade-off between user effort during calibration and the stability of resulting circumferential quantities.

Our key contribution is Deep Gaussian Shadow Maps (DGSM), a modern analogue of the classical shadow mapping algorithm tailored to the volumetric 3DGS representation. Building on the classic deep shadow mapping idea, we show that 3DGS admits closed form light accumulation along light rays, enabling volumetric shadow computation without meshing. For each estimated light, we tabulate transmittance over concentric radial shells and store them in octahedral atlases, which modern GPUs can sample in real time per query to attenuate affected scene Gaussians and thus cast and receive shadows consistently. To relight moving avatars, we approximate the local environment illumination with HDRI probes represented in a spherical harmonic (SH) basis and apply a fast per Gaussian radiance transfer, avoiding explicit BRDF estimation or offline optimization. We demonstrate environment consistent lighting for avatars from AvatarX and ActorsHQ, composited into ScanNet++, DL3DV, and SuperSplat scenes, and show interactions with inserted objects. Across single and multi avatar settings, DGSM and SH relighting operate fully in the volumetric 3DGS representation, yielding coherent shadows and relighting while avoiding meshing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9762\u54113D Gaussian Splatting\u7684DGSM\u4e0eSH\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u9634\u5f71\u4e0e\u91cd\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u57283DGS\u8868\u793a\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u6216\u63d2\u5165\u5bf9\u8c61\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u7684\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u9634\u5f71\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u6216\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u62df\u89d2\u8272\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u5149\u7167\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDGSM\uff0c\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u6df1\u5ea6\u9634\u5f71\u6620\u5c04\u601d\u60f3\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u4f53\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5229\u75283DGS\u6cbf\u5149\u7ebf\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u5149\u7d2f\u79ef\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f53\u79ef\u900f\u5c04\u7387\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5149\u6e90\u5728\u540c\u5fc3\u5f84\u5411\u58f3\u4e0a\u8868\u683c\u5316\u900f\u5c04\u7387\u5e76\u5b58\u50a8\u4e8e\u516b\u9762\u4f53\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0cGPU\u53ef\u5b9e\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u4ee5\u8870\u51cf\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5143\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f53\u79ef\u9634\u5f71\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7528HDRI\u63a2\u9488\u7528\u7403\u9762\u8c10\u6ce2\uff08SH\uff09\u8868\u793a\u8fd1\u573a\u73af\u5883\u7167\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u8fdb\u884c\u5feb\u901f\u8f90\u5c04\u4f20\u8f93\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ee5\u91cd\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u663e\u5f0fBRDF\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u79bb\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728AvatarX\u4e0eActorsHQ\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89d2\u8272\u3001\u4ee5\u53caScanNet++\u3001DL3DV\u548cSuperSplat\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDGSM\u4e0eSH\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u5728\u5355\u4eba\u548c\u591a\u4eba\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u80fd\u5728\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u5185\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u9634\u5f71\u4e0e\u5149\u7167\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf93D Gaussian Splatting\uff083DGS\uff09\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u9634\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Deep Gaussian Shadow Maps\uff08DGSM\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u7f51\u683c\u5316\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6295\u5c04\u4e0e\u63a5\u6536\u4e00\u81f4\u9634\u5f71\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u89d2\u8272\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3002"}}

Accurate wildfire risk prediction is hindered by the intrinsic stochasticity of ignition and spread and by nonlinear interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, climate variability, topography, and human activities, challenging the reliability and interpretability of purely data-driven models. We propose a trustworthy data-driven wildfire risk prediction framework based on long-sequence, multi-scale temporal modeling, which integrates heterogeneous drivers while explicitly quantifying predictive uncertainty and enabling process-level interpretation. Evaluated over western Canada during the record-breaking 2023 and 2024 fire seasons, the proposed model outperforms existing time-series approaches, achieving an F1 score of 0.90 and a PR-AUC of 0.98 with low computational cost. Uncertainty-aware analysis reveals structured spatial and seasonal patterns in predictive confidence, highlighting increased uncertainty associated with ambiguous predictions and spatiotemporal decision boundaries. SHAP-based interpretation provides mechanistic understanding of wildfire controls, showing that temperature-related drivers dominate wildfire risk in both years, while moisture-related constraints play a stronger role in shaping spatial and land-cover-specific contrasts in 2024 compared to the widespread hot and dry conditions of 2023.

This study evaluates the performance of four deep learning-based face recognition models FaceNet, ArcFace, MagFace, and CosFace on a newly developed longitudinal dataset collected over a 24 month period in seven sessions involving children aged 0 to 3 years. Our analysis examines recognition accuracy across developmental stages, showing that the True Accept Rate (TAR) is only 30.7% at 0.1% False Accept Rate (FAR) for infants aged 0 to 6 months, due to unstable facial features. Performance improves significantly in older children, reaching 64.7% TAR at 0.1% FAR in the 2.5 to 3 year age group. We also evaluate verification performance over different time intervals, revealing that shorter time gaps result in higher accuracy due to reduced embedding drift. To mitigate this drift, we apply a Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) approach that improves TAR by over 12%, yielding features that are more temporally stable and generalizable. These findings are critical for building biometric systems that function reliably over time in smart city applications such as public healthcare, child safety, and digital identity services. The challenges observed in early age groups highlight the importance of future research on privacy preserving biometric authentication systems that can address temporal variability, particularly in secure and regulated urban environments where child verification is essential.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u89c1\u4e0b\u6587TL;DR\u8282", "motivation": "\u89c1\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u673a\u8282", "method": "\u89c1\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u8282", "result": "\u89c1\u4e0b\u6587\u7ed3\u679c\u8282", "conclusion": "\u89c1\u4e0b\u6587\u7ed3\u8bba\u8282"}}

Despite advancements in AI, clinically viable segmentation is often hindered by the scarcity of 3D annotations, patient-specific variability, data privacy concerns, and substantial computational overhead. In this work, we propose FALCON, a cross-domain few-shot segmentation framework that achieves high-precision 3D volume segmentation by processing data as 2D slices. The framework is first meta-trained on natural images to learn-to-learn generalizable segmentation priors, then transferred to the medical domain via adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning.

Submitted to CVPR 2026", "summary": "Roadside perception datasets are typically constructed via cooperative labeling between synchronized vehicle and roadside frame pairs. However, real deployment often requires annotation of roadside-only data due to hardware and privacy constraints. Even human experts struggle to produce accurate labels without vehicle-side data (image, LIDAR), which not only increases annotation difficulty and cost, but also reveals a fundamental learnability problem: many roadside-only scenes contain distant, blurred, or occluded objects whose 3D properties are ambiguous from a single view and can only be reliably annotated by cross-checking paired vehicle--roadside frames. We refer to such cases as inherently ambiguous samples. To reduce wasted annotation effort on inherently ambiguous samples while still obtaining high-performing models, we turn to active learning. This work focuses on active learning for roadside monocular 3D object detection and proposes a learnability-driven framework that selects scenes which are both informative and reliably labelable, suppressing inherently ambiguous samples while ensuring coverage. Experiments demonstrate that our method, LH3D, achieves 86.06%, 67.32%, and 78.67% of full-performance for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists respectively, using only 25% of the annotation budget on DAIR-V2X-I, significantly outperforming uncertainty-based baselines.

To address this foundational data gap, we first introduce FFP-300K, a new large-scale dataset comprising 300K high-fidelity video pairs at 720p resolution and 81 frames in length, constructed via a principled two-track pipeline for diverse local and global edits. Building on this dataset, we propose a novel framework designed for true guidance-free FFP that resolves the critical tension between maintaining first-frame appearance and preserving source video motion. Architecturally, we introduce Adaptive Spatio-Temporal RoPE (AST-RoPE), which dynamically remaps positional encodings to disentangle appearance and motion references. At the objective level, we employ a self-distillation strategy where an identity propagation task acts as a powerful regularizer, ensuring long-term temporal stability and preventing semantic drift.

Existing methods with fixed mask ratio neglect multi-level representational correlations and intrinsic geometric structures, while relying on point-wise reconstruction assumptions that conflict with the diversity of point cloud. To address these issues, we propose a 3D representation learning method, termed Point-SRA, which aligns representations through self-distillation and probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we assign different masking ratios to the MAE to capture complementary geometric and semantic information, while the MeanFlow Transformer (MFT) leverages cross-modal conditional embeddings to enable diverse probabilistic reconstruction. Our analysis further reveals that representations at different time steps in MFT also exhibit complementarity. Therefore, a Dual Self-Representation Alignment mechanism is proposed at both the MAE and MFT levels. Finally, we design a Flow-Conditioned Fine-Tuning Architecture to fully exploit the point cloud distribution learned via MeanFlow. Point-SRA outperforms Point-MAE by 5.37% on ScanObjectNN. On intracranial aneurysm segmentation, it reaches 96.07% mean IoU for arteries and 86.87% for aneurysms.

To address these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage framework MANGO, which leveraging pure image-level supervision by alternately training to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo-3D labels, thereby achieving better alignment with real-world conversational behaviors. Specifically, in the first stage, a diffusion-based transformer with a dual-audio interaction module models natural 3D motion from multi-speaker audio. In the second stage, we use a fast 3D Gaussian Renderer to generate high-fidelity images and provide 2D-level photometric supervision for the 3D motions through alternate training. Additionally, we introduce MANGO-Dialog, a high-quality dataset with over 50 hours of aligned 2D-3D conversational data across 500+ identities.

In collaboration with pathologists and guided by the the College of American Pathologists (CAP) Cancer Protocols, we design a Clinical Pathology Report Template (CPRT) that ensures comprehensive and standardized extraction of diagnostic elements from pathology reports. We validate the effectiveness of our pipeline on TCGA-BRCA. First, we extract pathological features from reports using CPRT. These features are then used to build CTIS-Align, a dataset of 80k slide-description pairs from 804 WSIs for vision-language alignment training, and CTIS-Bench, a rigorously curated VQA benchmark comprising 977 WSIs and 14,879 question-answer pairs. CTIS-Bench emphasizes clinically grounded, closed-ended questions (e.g., tumor grade, receptor status) that reflect real diagnostic workflows, minimize non-visual reasoning, and require genuine slide understanding. We further propose CTIS-QA, a Slide-level Question Answering model, featuring a dual-stream architecture that mimics pathologists' diagnostic approach.

However, most such methods rely on vast amounts of pretraining data. This work introduces Subimage Overlap Prediction, a novel self-supervised pretraining task to aid semantic segmentation in remote sensing imagery that uses significantly lesser pretraining imagery. Given an image, a sub-image is extracted and the model is trained to produce a semantic mask of the location of the extracted sub-image within the original image. We demonstrate that pretraining with this task results in significantly faster convergence, and equal or better performance (measured via mIoU) on downstream segmentation. This gap in convergence and performance widens when labeled training data is reduced. We show this across multiple architecture types, and with multiple downstream datasets. We also show that our method matches or exceeds performance while requiring significantly lesser pretraining data relative to other SSL methods.

Many parameter-efficient Video-LLMs rely on unconstrained bidirectional projectors to model inter-frame interactions, which can blur temporal ordering by allowing later frames to influence earlier representations, without explicit architectural mechanisms to respect the directional nature of video reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose V-CORE, a parameter-efficient framework that introduces explicit temporal ordering constraints for video understanding. V-CORE consists of two key components: (1) Learnable Spatial Aggregation (LSA), which adaptively selects salient spatial tokens to reduce redundancy, and (2) a Causality-Aware Temporal Projector (CATP), which enforces structured unidirectional information flow via block-causal attention and a terminal dynamic summary token acting as a causal sink. This design preserves intra-frame spatial interactions while ensuring that temporal information is aggregated in a strictly ordered manner. With 4-bit QLoRA and a frozen LLM backbone, V-CORE can be trained efficiently on a single consumer GPU.

Owing to its rapid spread characteristics, early and precise identification is crucial to prevent outbreaks and ensure timely intervention. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning-based approach called LUMPNet for the early detection of LSD. LUMPNet utilizes image data to detect and classify skin nodules -- the primary indicator of LSD. To this end, LUMPNet uses YOLOv11, EfficientNet-based CNN classifier with compound scaling, and a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer. More precisely, LUMPNet detects and localizes LSD skin nodules and lesions on cattle images. It exploits EfficientNet to classify the localized cattle images into LSD-affected or healthy categories. To stabilize and accelerate the training of YOLOv11 and EfficientNet hybrid model, a novel adaptive hybrid optimizer is proposed and utilized. We evaluate LUMPNet at various stages of LSD using a publicly available dataset. Results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves 99% LSD detection training accuracy, and outperforms existing schemes. The model also achieves validation accuracy of 98%. Moreover, for further evaluation, we conduct a case study using an optimized EfficientNet-B0 model trained with the AdamW optimizer, and compare its performance with LUMPNet.

Motivated by evidence that scene contextual information plays a crucial role in modulating human attention, in this paper, we present a language-guided scene context-aware learning framework for robust egocentric visual attention prediction. We first design a context perceiver which is guided to summarize the egocentric video based on a language-based scene description, generating context-aware video representations. We then introduce two training objectives that: 1) encourage the framework to focus on the target point-of-interest regions and 2) suppress distractions from irrelevant regions which are less likely to attract first-person attention.

In the RSwinV2 method, a hierarchical structure of the transformer has been customized based on the input dimensionality, embedding structure, and output targeted by the method. In this RSwinV2 approach, the input image has been split into non-overlapping patches and processed using shifted windows and attention in these patches. This process has helped the method link all the windows efficiently by avoiding the locality issues of non-overlapping regions in attention, while being computationally efficient. RSwinV2 has further developed based on SwinTransformer and has included patch and position embeddings to take advantage of the transformer global-linking capability by employing multi-head attention in these embeddings. Furthermore, RSwinV2 has developed and incorporated the Inverse Residual Block (IRB) into this method, which utilizes convolutional skip connections with these inclusive designs to address the vanishing gradient issues during processing. RSwinV2 inclusion of IRB has therefore facilitated this method to link global patterns as well as local patterns; hence, its integrity has helped improve lesion classification capability by minimizing variability of Mpox and increasing differences of Mpox, chickenpox, measles, and cowpox. In testing SwinV2, its accuracy of 96.21 and an F1score of 95.62 have been achieved on the Kaggle public dataset, which has outperformed standard CNN models and SwinTransformers; RSwinV2 vector has thus proved its valiance as a computer-assisted tool for Mpox lesion observation interpretation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRSwinV2\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408SwinTransformer\u7684shifted-window\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u5377\u79ef\u9006\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5728Kaggle\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe96.21%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300195.62% F1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9Mpox\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u4e0e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u5982\u6c34\u75d8\u3001\u9ebb\u75b9\u3001\u725b\u75d8\uff09\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7c7b\u5185\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u6027\uff0c\u8f85\u52a9\u4e34\u5e8a\u6216\u8fdc\u7a0b\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSwinTransformerV2\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5207\u5206\u4e3a\u975e\u91cd\u53e0patch\u5e76\u91c7\u7528shifted window\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9a\u5236\u8f93\u5165\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\uff0c\u52a0\u5165patch/position\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165Inverse Residual Block\uff08\u5377\u79ef\u6b8b\u5dee\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\uff09\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u68af\u5ea6\u6d88\u5931\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00Kaggle\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRSwinV2\u8fbe\u5230\u4e8696.21%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e95.62% F1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u548c\u539f\u59cbSwinTransformer\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728Mpox\u75c5\u53d8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRSwinV2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728SwinTransformer\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5b9a\u5236\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u9006\u6b8b\u5dee\u5757\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u75d8\u7c7b\u75c5\u53d8\uff08Mpox\uff09\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728Kaggle\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8696.21%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c95.62% F1\u3002"}}

While some studies have addressed the generation of facial videos driven by emotional audio, efficiently generating high-quality talking head videos that integrate both emotional expressions and style features remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ESGaussianFace, an innovative framework for emotional and stylized audio-driven facial animation. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct 3D scenes and render videos, ensuring efficient generation of 3D consistent results. We propose an emotion-audio-guided spatial attention method that effectively integrates emotion features with audio content features. Through emotion-guided attention, the model is able to reconstruct facial details across different emotional states more accurately. To achieve emotional and stylized deformations of the 3D Gaussian points through emotion and style features, we introduce two 3D Gaussian deformation predictors. Futhermore, we propose a multi-stage training strategy, enabling the step-by-step learning of the character's lip movements, emotional variations, and style features. Our generated results exhibit high efficiency, high quality, and 3D consistency.

While most existing methods focus on improving within-category anomaly scoring, practical deployments increasingly require task-agnostic operation under continual category expansion, where the category identity is unknown at test time. In this setting, overall performance is often dominated by expert selection, namely routing an input to an appropriate normality model before any head-specific scoring is applied. However, routing rules that compare head-specific anomaly scores across independently constructed heads are unreliable in practice, as score distributions can differ substantially across categories in scale and tail behavior.\n  We propose GCR, a lightweight mixture-of-experts framework for stabilizing task-agnostic continual anomaly detection through geometry-consistent routing. GCR routes each test image directly in a shared frozen patch-embedding space by minimizing an accumulated nearest-prototype distance to category-specific prototype banks, and then computes anomaly maps only within the routed expert using a standard prototype-based scoring rule. By separating cross-head decision making from within-head anomaly scoring, GCR avoids cross-head score comparability issues without requiring end-to-end representation learning.\n  Experiments on MVTec AD and VisA show that geometry-consistent routing substantially improves routing stability and mitigates continual performance collapse, achieving near-zero forgetting while maintaining competitive detection and localization performance. These results indicate that many failures previously attributed to representation forgetting can instead be explained by decision-rule instability in cross-head routing.

Our approach includes three key innovative components: (i) A principled method is proposed to extract entity-level textual information from image captions generated by large vision-language models, eliminating semantic noise from raw text while preserving critical semantic information; (ii) A parallel multi-task learning architecture is constructed, which integrates image fusion with a multi-label classification task. By using entities as pseudo-labels, the multi-label classification task provides semantic supervision, enabling the model to achieve a deeper understanding of image content and significantly improving the quality and semantic density of the fused image; (iii) An entity-guided cross-modal interactive module is also developed to facilitate the fine-grained interaction between visual and entity-level textual features, which enhances feature representation by capturing cross-modal dependencies at both inter-visual and visual-entity levels. To promote the wide application of the entity-guided image fusion framework, we release the entity-annotated version of four public datasets (i.e., TNO, RoadScene, M3FD, and MSRS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGMT achieves superior performance in preserving salient targets, texture details, and semantic consistency, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Some recent works recognize that visual perception is a bottleneck in visual mathematical reasoning, but their solutions are limited to improving the extraction and interpretation of visual inputs. Notably, they all ignore the key issue of whether the extracted visual cues are faithfully integrated and properly utilized in subsequent reasoning. Motivated by this, we present CogFlow, a novel cognitive-inspired three-stage framework that incorporates a knowledge internalization stage, explicitly simulating the hierarchical flow of human reasoning: perception$\\Rightarrow$internalization$\\Rightarrow$reasoning. Inline with this hierarchical flow, we holistically enhance all its stages. We devise Synergistic Visual Rewards to boost perception capabilities in parametric and semantic spaces, jointly improving visual information extraction from symbols and diagrams. To guarantee faithful integration of extracted visual cues into subsequent reasoning, we introduce a Knowledge Internalization Reward model in the internalization stage, bridging perception and reasoning. Moreover, we design a Visual-Gated Policy Optimization algorithm to further enforce the reasoning is grounded with the visual knowledge, preventing models seeking shortcuts that appear coherent but are visually ungrounded reasoning chains. Moreover, we contribute a new dataset MathCog for model training, which contains samples with over 120K high-quality perception-reasoning aligned annotations. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on commonly used visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks validate the superiority of the proposed CogFlow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCogFlow\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u611f\u77e5\u2192\u5185\u5316\u2192\u63a8\u7406\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u5185\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u95e8\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b12\u4e07\u591a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u6ce8\u7684MathCog\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u88ab\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u540e\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bfb\u627e\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u201c\u6377\u5f84\u201d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u5206\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u611f\u77e5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u534f\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b2) \u5185\u5316\uff1a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u77e5\u8bc6\u5185\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u88ab\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6574\u5408\uff1b3) \u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u95e8\u63a7\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u89c6\u89c9\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u5e76\u6784\u5efaMathCog\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5e38\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cCogFlow\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u9f50\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636eMathCog\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6d88\u878d\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "CogFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u5185\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

Existing approaches primarily focus on minimizing interference between concepts, often neglecting the potential for positive inter-concept interactions. In this work, we present Forget Less by Learning from Parents (FLLP), a novel framework that introduces a parent-child inter-concept learning mechanism in hyperbolic space to mitigate forgetting.

While ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for detecting thyroid nodules, its diagnostic accuracy is often limited by challenges such as low image contrast and blurred nodule boundaries. To address these issues, we propose Nodule-DETR, a novel detection transformer (DETR) architecture designed for robust thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound images. Nodule-DETR introduces three key innovations: a Multi-Spectral Frequency-domain Channel Attention (MSFCA) module that leverages frequency analysis to enhance features of low-contrast nodules; a Hierarchical Feature Fusion (HFF) module for efficient multi-scale integration; and Multi-Scale Deformable Attention (MSDA) to flexibly capture small and irregularly shaped nodules. We conducted extensive experiments on a clinical dataset of real-world thyroid ultrasound images. The results demonstrate that Nodule-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by a significant margin of 0.149 in mAP@0.5:0.95. The superior accuracy of Nodule-DETR highlights its significant potential for clinical application as an effective tool in computer-aided thyroid diagnosis.

To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads.

With the development of continual learning, significant progress has been made in retaining knowledge and adapting to new information in the VQA domain. However, current methods often struggle with balancing knowledge retention, adaptation, and robust feature representation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework with adaptive memory allocation and global noise filtering called MacVQA for visual question answering.

However, due to language bias, LVLMs are susceptible to object hallucination, which can be primarily divided into category, attribute, and relation hallucination, significantly impeding the trustworthy AI applications. Editing the internal activations of LVLMs has shown promising effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations with minimal cost. However, previous editing approaches neglect the effective guidance offered by factual textual semantics, thereby struggling to explicitly mitigate language bias. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Factual-guided Visual-Textual Editing for hallucination mitigation (AFTER), which comprises Factual-Augmented Activation Steering (FAS) and Query-Adaptive Offset Optimization (QAO), to adaptively guides the original biased activations towards factual semantics. Specifically, FAS is proposed to provide factual and general guidance for activation editing, thereby explicitly modeling the precise visual-textual associations. Subsequently, QAO introduces a query-aware offset estimator to establish query-specific editing from the general steering vector, enhancing the diversity and granularity of editing. Extensive experiments on standard hallucination benchmarks across three widely adopted LVLMs validate the efficacy of the proposed AFTER, notably achieving up to a 16.3% reduction of hallucination over baseline on the AMBER benchmark.

Under review", "summary": "Spatial reasoning -- the ability to perceive and reason about relationships in space -- advances vision-language models (VLMs) from visual perception toward spatial semantic understanding. Existing approaches either revisit local image patches, improving fine-grained perception but weakening global spatial awareness, or mark isolated coordinates, which capture object locations but overlook their overall organization. In this work, we integrate the cognitive concept of an object-centric blueprint into VLMs to enhance spatial reasoning. Given an image and a question, the model first constructs a JSON-style blueprint that records the positions, sizes, and attributes of relevant objects, and then reasons over this structured representation to produce the final answer. To achieve this, we introduce three key techniques: (1) blueprint-embedded reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning to elicit basic reasoning skills; (2) blueprint-aware rewards in reinforcement learning to encourage the blueprint to include an appropriate number of objects and to align final answers with this causal reasoning; and (3) anti-shortcut data augmentation that applies targeted perturbations to images and questions, discouraging reliance on superficial visual or linguistic cues. Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing VLMs and specialized spatial reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728 VLM \u4e2d\u6784\u5efa JSON \u5f0f\u5bf9\u8c61\u84dd\u56fe\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u84dd\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u4e0e\u53cd\u6377\u5f84\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u805a\u7126\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u8865\u4e01\u6539\u5584\u7cbe\u7ec6\u611f\u77e5\u4f46\u524a\u5f31\u6574\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u6216\u6807\u6ce8\u5b64\u7acb\u5750\u6807\u5ffd\u89c6\u6574\u4f53\u7ec4\u7ec7\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d7\u8ba4\u77e5\u5b66\u4e2d\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u84dd\u56fe\u6982\u5ff5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u5bf9\u8c61\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u84dd\u56fe\uff1b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408(1)\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u84dd\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u76d1\u7763\uff0c(2)\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u84dd\u56fe\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u5408\u9002\u6570\u91cf\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e76\u4f7f\u7b54\u6848\u4e0e\u84dd\u56fe\u56e0\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca(3)\u53cd\u6377\u5f84\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u963b\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9/\u8bed\u8a00\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528 VLM \u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u84dd\u56fe\u5f0f\u5bf9\u8c61\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u84dd\u56fe\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u8bb0\u5f55\u76f8\u5173\u5bf9\u8c61\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684 JSON \u5f0f\u84dd\u56fe\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing methods mainly address a single type of degradation (e.g., haze or low-light) at a time, ignoring the interplay of different degradation types and resulting in limited visibility improvement. We observe that the domain knowledge shared between low-light and haze priors can be reinforced mutually for better visibility. Based on this key insight, in this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances visibility in nighttime hazy images by reinforcing the intrinsic consistency between haze and low-light priors mutually and progressively. In particular, our model utilizes image-, patch-, and pixel-level experts that operate across visual and frequency domains to recover global scene structure, regional patterns, and fine-grained details progressively.

Nevertheless, their performance drops significantly on severely degraded, low-quality images, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose GleSAM++, which utilizes Generative Latent space Enhancement to boost robustness on low-quality images, thus enabling generalization across various image qualities. Additionally, to improve compatibility between the pre-trained diffusion model and the segmentation framework, we introduce two techniques, i.e., Feature Distribution Alignment (FDA) and Channel Replication and Expansion (CRE). However, the above components lack explicit guidance regarding the degree of degradation. The model is forced to implicitly fit a complex noise distribution that spans conditions from mild noise to severe artifacts, which substantially increases the learning burden and leads to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this issue, we further introduce a Degradation-aware Adaptive Enhancement (DAE) mechanism. The key principle of DAE is to decouple the reconstruction process for arbitrary-quality features into two stages: degradation-level prediction and degradation-aware reconstruction. Our method can be applied to pre-trained SAM and SAM2 with only minimal additional learnable parameters, allowing for efficient optimization.

Currently, depth foundation models, such as Depth Anything, achieve great success in ideal scenes but remain challenging under adverse imaging conditions such as extreme illumination and motion blur. These degradations corrupt the visual signals of frame cameras, weakening the discriminative features of frame-based depths across the spatial and temporal dimensions. Typically, existing approaches incorporate event cameras to leverage their high dynamic range and temporal resolution, aiming to compensate for corrupted frame features. However, such specialized fusion models are predominantly trained from scratch on domain-specific datasets, thereby failing to inherit the open-world knowledge and robust generalization inherent to foundation models. In this work, we propose ADAE, an event-guided spatiotemporal fusion framework for Depth Anything in degraded scenes. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1) Entropy-Aware Spatial Fusion. We adaptively merge frame-based and event-based features using an information entropy strategy to indicate illumination-induced degradation. 2) Motion-Guided Temporal Correction. We resort to the event-based motion cue to recalibrate ambiguous features in blurred regions. Under our unified framework, the two components are complementary to each other and jointly enhance Depth Anything under adverse imaging conditions.

Moreover, it supports open-vocabulary recognition, enabling users to detect objects using arbitrary text queries, thus overcoming the limitations of traditional supervised approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u65e0\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u865a\u62df\u76f8\u673a\u6295\u5f71+\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u76842D\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u56de\u6295\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c473D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6602\u8d35\u76843D\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u914d\u5bf9RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u501f\u52a9\u5f3a\u5927\u76842D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u62d3\u5c55\u5206\u5272\u80fd\u529b\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u865a\u62df\u76f8\u673a\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u6295\u5f71\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u76842D\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bcf\u89c6\u89d2\u8bed\u4e49\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u52a0\u6743\u6295\u7968\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d22D\u9884\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\u56de3D\u70b9\u4e91\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b03D\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u97003D\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u914d\u5bf9RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u70b9\u4e913D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. This design integrates perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified, self-corrective decision process. To enable fine-grained supervision and quantitative evaluation, we further construct GenBlemish-27K, a dataset of 6K T2I images with 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories.

Accurate simulation of postoperative facial morphology is essential for preoperative planning. However, traditional biomechanical models are computationally expensive, while geometric deep learning approaches often lack interpretability. In this study, we develop and validate a physics-informed geometric deep learning framework named PhysSFI-Net for precise prediction of soft tissue deformation following orthognathic surgery. PhysSFI-Net consists of three components: a hierarchical graph module with craniofacial and surgical plan encoders combined with attention mechanisms to extract skeletal-facial interaction features; a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based sequential predictor for incremental soft tissue deformation; and a biomechanics-inspired module for high-resolution facial surface reconstruction. Model performance was assessed using point cloud shape error (Hausdorff distance), surface deviation error, and landmark localization error (Euclidean distances of craniomaxillofacial landmarks) between predicted facial shapes and corresponding ground truths. A total of 135 patients who underwent combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment were included for model training and validation.

We develop MCD-Net, a lightweight baseline that integrates a MobileNetV2 encoder, a Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and a DeepLabV3+ decoder.

Although ridge delineation remains constrained by sub-pixel width and spectral ambiguity, the results demonstrate that optical imagery alone can provide reliable moraine-body segmentation.

However, a fundamental limitation persists: the deep entanglement of illumination and intrinsic appearance prevents controllable relighting. Existing disentanglement methods rely on strong assumptions to enable weakly supervised learning, which restricts their capacity for complex illumination. To address this challenge, we introduce HeadLighter, a novel supervised framework that learns a physically plausible decomposition of appearance and illumination in head generative models. Specifically, we design a dual-branch architecture that separately models lighting-invariant head attributes and physically grounded rendering components. A progressive disentanglement training is employed to gradually inject head appearance priors into the generative architecture, supervised by multi-view images captured under controlled light conditions with a light stage setup.

To address this, we introduce a pioneering new task, Personalized Martial Arts Combat Video Generation. Our approach, MagicFight, is specifically crafted to overcome these hurdles. Given this pioneering task, we face a lack of appropriate datasets.

Springer, Cham", "summary": "The automotive industry's pursuit of enhanced fuel economy and performance necessitates efficient aerodynamic design. However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6309\u6765\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\u5207\u7247\u7684PointNet2D+\u53cc\u5411LSTM\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Cd\u9884\u6d4b\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u5177\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u65e9\u671f\u6c7d\u8f66\u6c14\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCFD\u548c\u98ce\u6d1e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6216\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5bf9\u8be6\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u8f93\u5165\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5c063D\u8f66\u8f86\u70b9\u4e91\u6cbf\u6765\u6d41\u65b9\u5411\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6a2a\u622a\u9762\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5207\u7247\u7531\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7PointNet2D\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5411LSTM\u5904\u7406\u5207\u7247\u7279\u5f81\u5e8f\u5217\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7eb5\u5411\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4bCd\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728DrivAerNet++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728DrivAerNet++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97R^2>0.9528\u548cMAE\u22486.046\u00d710^{-3}\u7684Cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ea60.025\u79d2/\u6837\u672c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5207\u7247\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6c14\u52a8\u963b\u529b\u7cfb\u6570\u9884\u6d4b\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08R^2>0.9528\uff0cMAE\u22486.046e-3\uff09\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u7ea60.025 s/\u6837\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u6c7d\u8f66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Progress in this area has been limited by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as pixel-level annotation is costly and time-consuming. To address this, recent methods leverage synthetic data or generate artificial change pairs, but out-of-domain generalization remains limited. In this work, we introduce a weak temporal supervision strategy that leverages additional temporal observations of existing single-temporal datasets, without requiring any new annotations. Specifically, we extend single-date remote sensing datasets with new observations acquired at different times and train a change detection model by assuming that real bi-temporal pairs mostly contain no change, while pairing images from different locations to generate change examples.

While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery has become a key tool for large-scale oil spill monitoring, most existing detection methods rely on deep learning-based segmentation applied to single SAR images. These static approaches struggle to distinguish true oil spills from visually similar oceanic features (e.g., biogenic slicks or low-wind zones), leading to high false positive rates and limited generalizability, especially under data-scarce conditions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Oil Spill Change Detection (OSCD), a new bi-temporal task that focuses on identifying changes between pre- and post-spill SAR images. As real co-registered pre-spill imagery is not always available, we propose the Temporal-Aware Hybrid Inpainting (TAHI) framework, which generates synthetic pre-spill images from post-spill SAR data. TAHI integrates two key components: High-Fidelity Hybrid Inpainting for oil-free reconstruction, and Temporal Realism Enhancement for radiometric and sea-state consistency. Using TAHI, we construct the first OSCD dataset and benchmark several state-of-the-art change detection models. Results show that OSCD significantly reduces false positives and improves detection accuracy compared to conventional segmentation, demonstrating the value of temporally-aware methods for reliable, scalable oil spill monitoring in real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51faOSCD\uff08\u53cc\u65f6\u76f8\u6ea2\u6cb9\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0eTAHI\u5408\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u707e\u524d\u5f71\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u5e8f\u6bd4\u5bf9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bef\u62a5\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6ea2\u6cb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645SAR\u76d1\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5f20SAR\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u6ea2\u6cb9\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u6d77\u51b5\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u6837\u672c\u532e\u4e4f\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTAHI\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6df7\u5408\u4fee\u590d\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u6ea2\u6cb9\u540e\u5f71\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u65e0\u6cb9\u707e\u524d\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8f90\u5c04\u4e0e\u6d77\u51b5\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u5408\u6210\u707e\u524d\u5f71\u50cf\u4ee5\u6784\u5efaOSCD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eTAHI\u5408\u6210\u7684\u707e\u524d\u5f71\u50cf\u6784\u5efa\u7684OSCD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u5e27\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65f6\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u6d77\u4e0a\u6ea2\u6cb9\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684OSCD\u4efb\u52a1\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u5bf9\u707e\u524d\u707e\u540eSAR\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u6ea2\u6cb9\u4e0e\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6d77\u6d0b\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, multi-person identification remains largely unexplored, with the limited existing work relying on complex, expensive setups requiring modified firmware. A critical question remains unanswered: is poor multi-person performance an algorithmic limitation or a fundamental hardware constraint? We systematically evaluate six diverse signal separation methods (FastICA, SOBI, PCA, NMF, Wavelet, Tensor Decomposition) across seven scenarios with 1-10 people using commodity ESP32 WiFi sensors--a simple, low-cost, off-the-shelf solution.

While deep architectures achieve high accuracy on benchmarks like CUB-200-2011, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Conversely, shallow networks (e.g., AlexNet, VGG) offer efficiency but fail to distinguish visually similar sub-categories. This is because standard Global Average Pooling (GAP) heads capture only first-order statistics, missing the subtle high-order feature interactions required for FGVC. While Bilinear CNNs address this, they suffer from high feature dimensionality and instability during training. To bridge this gap, we propose the Quantum-inspired Interaction Classifier (QuIC). Drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics, QuIC models feature channels as interacting quantum states and captures second-order feature covariance via a learnable observable operator. Designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module, QuIC supports stable, single-stage end-to-end training without exploding feature dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that QuIC significantly revitalizes shallow backbones: it boosts the Top-1 accuracy of VGG16 by nearly 20% and outperforms state-of-the-art attention mechanisms (SE-Block) on ResNet18. Qualitative analysis, including t-SNE visualization, further confirms that QuIC resolves ambiguous cases by explicitly attending to fine-grained discriminative features and enforcing compact intra-class clustering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faQuIC\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u542f\u53d1\u4e8c\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3GAP\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u901a\u9053\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d45\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u7684FGVC\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGAP\u53ea\u6355\u83b7\u4e00\u9636\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c\u5b50\u7c7b\uff1bBilinear\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u9ad8\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u4f46\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u4ea4\u4e92\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u9053\u89c6\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684observable\u7b97\u7b26\u6765\u6355\u6349\u4e8c\u9636\u7279\u5f81\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d2\u62d4\u5f0f\u5934\u90e8\u66ff\u6362GAP\uff1b\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u7ef4\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\uff0cQuIC\u4f7fVGG16\u7684Top-1\u63d0\u5347\u8fd120%\uff0c\u5728ResNet18\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eSE-Block\uff1bt-SNE\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793aQuIC\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7c7b\u5185\u7d27\u51d1\u6027\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6b67\u4e49\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "QuIC\u6a21\u5757\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u548c\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5b50\u6001\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u7b26\u6355\u6349\u4e8c\u9636\u901a\u9053\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6d45\u5c42\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u5728FGVC\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Yet, the performance of pathology foundation models across magnifications and the effect of magnification sampling during training remain poorly understood. We model magnification sampling as a multi-source domain adaptation problem and develop a simple theoretical framework that reveals systematic trade-offs between sampling strategies. We show that the widely used discrete uniform sampling of magnifications (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mpp) leads to degradation at intermediate magnifications. We introduce continuous magnification sampling, which removes gaps in magnification coverage while preserving performance at standard scales. Further, we derive sampling distributions that optimize representation quality across magnification scales. To evaluate these strategies, we introduce two new benchmarks (TCGA-MS, BRACS-MS) with appropriate metrics. Our experiments show that continuous sampling substantially improves over discrete sampling at intermediate magnifications, with gains of up to 4 percentage points in balanced classification accuracy, and that optimized distributions can further improve performance. Finally, we evaluate current histopathology foundation models, finding that magnification is a primary driver of performance variation across models.

However, practical deployment is severely hampered by the domain shift problem, where models trained in one environment fail to generalise to another. To overcome this, we propose a novel two-stage framework centred on a CSI-ResNet-A architecture. This model is pre-trained via self-supervised contrastive learning to learn domain-invariant representations and leverages lightweight Adapter modules for highly efficient fine-tuning. The resulting event sequence is then processed by a stateful counting machine to produce a final, stable occupancy estimate. We validate our framework extensively. On our WiFlow dataset, our unsupervised approach excels in a 10-shot learning scenario, achieving a final Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of just 0.44--a task where supervised baselines fail.

Motivated by the distinct nature of modalities - where text is strictly sequential and images are inherently hierarchical - we retain next-token prediction for text but adopt next-scale prediction for visual generation.

Existing LVSR methods often struggle to recover fine details due to limited contrast and insufficient high-frequency information. To overcome these challenges, we present RetinexEVSR, the first event-driven LVSR framework that leverages high-contrast event signals and Retinex-inspired priors to enhance video quality under low-light scenarios. Unlike previous approaches that directly fuse degraded signals, RetinexEVSR introduces a novel bidirectional cross-modal fusion strategy to extract and integrate meaningful cues from noisy event data and degraded RGB frames. Specifically, an illumination-guided event enhancement module is designed to progressively refine event features using illumination maps derived from the Retinex model, thereby suppressing low-light artifacts while preserving high-contrast details. Furthermore, we propose an event-guided reflectance enhancement module that utilizes the enhanced event features to dynamically recover reflectance details via a multi-scale fusion mechanism. Experimental results show that our RetinexEVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets. Notably, on the SDSD benchmark, our method can get up to 2.95 dB gain while reducing runtime by 65% compared to prior event-based methods.

To understand the internal mechanism of MMDiT-based models, existing methods tried to analyze the effect of specific components like positional encoding and attention layers. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms various baselines and remains flexible across text-to-image generation, image editing, and inference acceleration.

However, this task remains challenging due to irregular nodule shapes, indistinct boundaries, substantial scale variations, and the presence of speckle noise that degrades structural visibility. To address these challenges, we propose a prior-guided DETR framework specifically designed for ultrasound nodule detection. Instead of relying on purely data-driven feature learning, the proposed framework progressively incorporates different prior knowledge at multiple stages of the network. First, a Spatially-adaptive Deformable FFN with Prior Regularization (SDFPR) is embedded into the CNN backbone to inject geometric priors into deformable sampling, stabilizing feature extraction for irregular and blurred nodules. Second, a Multi-scale Spatial-Frequency Feature Mixer (MSFFM) is designed to extract multi-scale structural priors, where spatial-domain processing emphasizes contour continuity and boundary cues, while frequency-domain modeling captures global morphology and suppresses speckle noise. Furthermore, a Dense Feature Interaction (DFI) mechanism propagates and exploits these prior-modulated features across all encoder layers, enabling the decoder to enhance query refinement under consistent geometric and structural guidance. Experiments conducted on two clinically collected thyroid ultrasound datasets (Thyroid I and Thyroid II) and two public benchmarks (TN3K and BUSI) for thyroid and breast nodules demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior accuracy compared with 18 detection methods, particularly in detecting morphologically complex nodules.The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjj1wjj/Ultrasound-DETR.", "AI": {"tldr": "Paper proposes prior-guided DETR for ultrasound nodules: spatially-adaptive deformable FFN with prior regularization, multi-scale spatial-frequency mixer, and dense feature interaction to inject geometric and structural priors; shows strong performance on thyroid and breast datasets", "motivation": "Improve ultrasound nodule detection by injecting priors to handle irregular shapes, indistinct boundaries, scale variation, speckle noise", "method": "Analyze methods and contributions", "result": "Proposed prior-guided DETR with SDFPR, MSFFM, DFI; outperforms 18 detectors on four datasets", "conclusion": "Incorporating geometric and structural priors at multiple stages stabilizes detection of challenging ultrasound nodules and boosts performance over existing detectors."}}

Directly regressing clean videos from adversarial inputs often fails to recover faithful content due to the subtle nature of perturbations; this necessitates physically shattering the adversarial structure. Therefore, we propose Flow Matching for Adversarial Video Purification FMVP. FMVP physically shatters global adversarial structures via a masking strategy and reconstructs clean video dynamics using Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) with an inpainting objective. To further decouple semantic content from adversarial noise, we design a Frequency-Gated Loss (FGL) that explicitly suppresses high-frequency adversarial residuals while preserving low-frequency fidelity.

Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff0c\u4f7f\u75282B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Qwen3-VL\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c1.6B\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bSana1.5\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e0e\u66f4\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f00\u6e90\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u867d\u53d1\u5c55\u8fc5\u901f\uff0c\u4f46\u8fbe\u5230\u5b9e\u7528\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5be5\u5be5\u4e14\u6269\u6563\u9aa8\u5e72\u901a\u5e38\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u7814\u7a76\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u4ee32B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Qwen3-VL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f16\u8f91\u5f15\u5bfc\u5668\u548c1.6B\u53c2\u6570\u7684Sana1.5\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u505a\u51fa\u4e13\u95e8\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6e90\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5728ImgEdit\u548cGEdit\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImgEdit\u548cGEdit\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u7d27\u51d1\u7ba1\u7ebf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u53ef\u572824GB GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4e8eNVIDIA H100\u4e0a\u4ee5BF16\u5728\u7ea64\u79d2\u5185\u751f\u62102K\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7f16\u8f91\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e25\u683c\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff082B\uff09\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff081.6B\uff09\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u3001\u5bf9\u8c61\u79fb\u9664\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u66ff\u6362\u7b49\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

While recent adapter-based approaches efficiently transfer RGB-pretrained foundation models to this task, they often prioritize model efficiency at the expense of cross-modal structural consistency. Consequently, critical structural cues are frequently lost when significant domain gaps arise, such as in high-contrast or nighttime environments. Moreover, conventional static multimodal fusion mechanisms typically lack environmental awareness, resulting in suboptimal adaptation and constrained detection performance under complex, dynamic scene variations. To address these limitations, we propose SLGNet, a parameter-efficient framework that synergizes hierarchical structural priors and language-guided modulation within a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model. Specifically, we design a Structure-Aware Adapter to extract hierarchical structural representations from both modalities and dynamically inject them into the ViT to compensate for structural degradation inherent in ViT-based backbones. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Guided Modulation module that exploits VLM-driven structured captions to dynamically recalibrate visual features, thereby endowing the model with robust environmental awareness.

Unlike AR and diffusion, VARs operate on heterogeneous input structures across their generation steps, which creates severe asynchronous policy conflicts. This issue becomes particularly acute in reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios, leading to unstable training and suboptimal alignment. To resolve this, we propose a novel framework to enhance Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by explicitly managing these conflicts. Our method integrates three synergistic components: 1) a stabilizing intermediate reward to guide early-stage generation; 2) a dynamic time-step reweighting scheme for precise credit assignment; and 3) a novel mask propagation algorithm, derived from principles of Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL), designed to isolate optimization effects both spatially and temporally. Our approach demonstrates significant improvements in sample quality and objective alignment over the vanilla GRPO baseline, enabling robust and effective optimization for VAR models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduce conflict-aware GRPO with intermediate rewards, time-step reweighting, and ReFL-based mask propagation to stabilize RL training for VARs, yielding better sample quality and alignment.", "motivation": "VAR models face asynchronous policy conflicts due to heterogeneous input structures across generation steps, causing unstable RL training and poor alignment.", "method": "Combine stabilizing intermediate rewards, dynamic time-step reweighting for credit assignment, and a mask propagation algorithm inspired by Reward Feedback Learning to isolate optimization effects spatially and temporally.", "result": "The proposed framework enhances GRPO using stabilizing intermediate rewards, dynamic time-step reweighting, and mask propagation via ReFL, improving sample quality and alignment over vanilla GRPO.", "conclusion": "The method resolves asynchronous policy conflicts and achieves robust, effective optimization for VAR models, outperforming baseline GRPO."}}

In this paper, we propose DiffProxy, a novel framework that generates multi-view consistent human proxies for mesh recovery. Central to DiffProxy is leveraging the diffusion-based generative priors to bridge the synthetic training and real-world generalization. Its key innovations include: (1) a multi-conditional mechanism for generating multi-view consistent, pixel-aligned human proxies; (2) a hand refinement module that incorporates flexible visual prompts to enhance local details; and (3) an uncertainty-aware test-time scaling method that increases robustness to challenging cases during optimization. These designs ensure that the mesh recovery process effectively benefits from the precise synthetic ground truth and generative advantages of the diffusion-based pipeline. Trained entirely on synthetic data, DiffProxy achieves state-of-the-art performance across five real-world benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization particularly on challenging scenarios with occlusions and partial views.

TopoLoRA-SAM injects Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into the frozen ViT encoder, augmented with a lightweight spatial convolutional adapter and optional topology-aware supervision via differentiable clDice. We evaluate our approach on five benchmarks spanning retinal vessel segmentation (DRIVE, STARE, CHASE\\_DB1), polyp segmentation (Kvasir-SEG), and SAR sea/land segmentation (SL-SSDD), comparing against U-Net, DeepLabV3+, SegFormer, and Mask2Former.

While offline models like VGGT achieve inspiring geometry capability, their batch-based nature renders them irrelevant for live systems. Streaming architectures, though the intended solution for live operation, have proven inadequate. Existing methods either fail to support truly infinite-horizon inputs or suffer from catastrophic drift over long sequences. We shatter this long-standing dilemma with InfiniteVGGT, a causal visual geometry transformer that operationalizes the concept of a rolling memory through a bounded yet adaptive and perpetually expressive KV cache. Capitalizing on this, we devise a training-free, attention-agnostic pruning strategy that intelligently discards obsolete information, effectively ``rolling'' the memory forward with each new frame. Fully compatible with FlashAttention, InfiniteVGGT finally alleviates the compromise, enabling infinite-horizon streaming while outperforming existing streaming methods in long-term stability. The ultimate test for such a system is its performance over a truly infinite horizon, a capability that has been impossible to rigorously validate due to the lack of extremely long-term, continuous benchmarks. To address this critical gap, we introduce the Long3D benchmark, which, for the first time, enables a rigorous evaluation of continuous 3D geometry estimation on sequences about 10,000 frames. This provides the definitive evaluation platform for future research in long-term 3D geometry understanding.

GeoRank outperforms or matches prior methods that integrate geographical metadata and consistently improves diverse contrastive SSL algorithms (e.g., BYOL, DINO). Beyond this, we present a systematic investigation of key adaptations of contrastive SSL for multispectral RS images, including the effectiveness of data augmentations, the impact of dataset cardinality and image size on performance, and the task dependency of temporal views.

Neves"], "title": "SortWaste: A Densely Annotated Dataset for Object Detection in Industrial Waste Sorting", "comment": "9 pages", "summary": "The increasing production of waste, driven by population growth, has created challenges in managing and recycling materials effectively. Manual waste sorting is a common practice; however, it remains inefficient for handling large-scale waste streams and presents health risks for workers. On the other hand, existing automated sorting approaches still struggle with the high variability, clutter, and visual complexity of real-world waste streams. The lack of real-world datasets for waste sorting is a major reason automated systems for this problem are underdeveloped. Accordingly, we introduce SortWaste, a densely annotated object detection dataset collected from a Material Recovery Facility. Additionally, we contribute to standardizing waste detection in sorting lines by proposing ClutterScore, an objective metric that gauges the scene's hardness level using a set of proxies that affect visual complexity (e.g., object count, class and size entropy, and spatial overlap).

Received by RA-L", "summary": "Monocular omnidirectional visual odometry (OVO) systems leverage 360-degree cameras to overcome field-of-view limitations of perspective VO systems. However, existing methods, reliant on handcrafted features or photometric objectives, often lack robustness in challenging scenarios, such as aggressive motion and varying illumination. To address this, we present 360DVO, the first deep learning-based OVO framework. Our approach introduces a distortion-aware spherical feature extractor (DAS-Feat) that adaptively learns distortion-resistant features from 360-degree images. These sparse feature patches are then used to establish constraints for effective pose estimation within a novel omnidirectional differentiable bundle adjustment (ODBA) module. To facilitate evaluation in realistic settings, we also contribute a new real-world OVO benchmark. Extensive experiments on this benchmark and public synthetic datasets (TartanAir V2 and 360VO) demonstrate that 360DVO surpasses state-of-the-art baselines (including 360VO and OpenVSLAM), improving robustness by 50% and accuracy by 37.5%.

However, in case of flood mapping using Sen1Flood11 dataset as a downstream task, GFMs struggles to outperform the baseline U-Net, highlighting model's limitation in capturing critical local nuances. To address this, we present the Prithvi-Complementary Adaptive Fusion Encoder (CAFE), which integrate Prithvi GFM pretrained encoder with a parallel CNN residual branch enhanced by Convolutional Attention Modules (CAM). Prithvi-CAFE enables fast and efficient fine-tuning through adapters in Prithvi and performs multi-scale, multi-level fusion with CNN features, capturing critical local details while preserving long-range dependencies. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two comprehensive flood mapping datasets: Sen1Flood11 and FloodPlanet. On Sen1Flood11 test data, Prithvi-CAFE (IoU 83.41) outperforms the original Prithvi (IoU 82.50) and other major GFMs (TerraMind 82.90, DOFA 81.54, spectralGPT: 81.02). The improvement is even more pronounced on the hold-out test site, where Prithvi-CAFE achieves an IoU of 81.37 compared to the baseline U-Net (70.57) and original Prithvi (72.42). On FloodPlanet, Prithvi-CAFE also surpasses the baseline U-Net and other GFMs, achieving an IoU of 64.70 compared to U-Net (60.14), Terramind (62.33), DOFA (59.15) and Prithvi 2.0 (61.91). Our proposed simple yet effective Prithvi-CAFE demonstrates strong potential for improving segmentation tasks where multi-channel and multi-modal data provide complementary information and local details are critical.

Submitted to ICPR 2026", "summary": "Contactless fingerprint recognition offers a hygienic and convenient alternative to contact-based systems, enabling rapid acquisition without latent prints, pressure artifacts, or hygiene risks. However, contactless images often show degraded ridge clarity due to illumination variation, subcutaneous skin discoloration, and specular reflections. Flash captures preserve ridge detail but introduce noise, whereas non-flash captures reduce noise but lower ridge contrast. We propose Fusion2Print (F2P), the first framework to systematically capture and fuse paired flash-non-flash contactless fingerprints. We construct a custom paired dataset, FNF Database, and perform manual flash-non-flash subtraction to isolate ridge-preserving signals.

The central thesis proposes that learning, across physical, biological, and computational systems, fundamentally constitutes the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, we establish a formal isomorphism between thermodynamic processes and Bayesian updating, demonstrating that sustainable learning systems must follow dissipative patterns where crystallized posteriors become priors for subsequent levels of emergence.\n  We derive fundamental mathematical constants (e, \u03c0, \u03c6) as fixed points of Bayesian inference under minimal axioms, suggesting these constants emerge necessarily from any system capable of representing and updating uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture linking G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems to thermodynamic constraints, hypothesizing that pathologies of formal systems (incompleteness, undecidability) are structurally analogous to dissipation deficits in physical systems.\n  As practical validation, we present a peer-to-peer network architecture implementing BEDS principles, achieving six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing distributed consensus systems while enabling continuous learning.

However, these methods often treat the semantic and rendering branches separately, relying solely on 2D supervision while ignoring the 3D Gaussian geometry. Moreover, current adaptive strategies adapt the Gaussian set depending solely on rendering gradients, which can be insufficient in subtle or textureless regions. In this work, we propose a joint enhancement framework for 3D semantic Gaussian modeling that synergizes both semantic and rendering branches. Firstly, unlike conventional point cloud shape encoding, we introduce an anisotropic 3D Gaussian Chebyshev descriptor using the Laplace-Beltrami operator to capture fine-grained 3D shape details, thereby distinguishing objects with similar appearances and reducing reliance on potentially noisy 2D guidance. In addition, without relying solely on rendering gradient, we adaptively adjust Gaussian allocation and spherical harmonics with local semantic and shape signals, enhancing rendering efficiency through selective resource allocation.

Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVINO\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210/\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563Transformer\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u591a\u53c2\u8003\u3001\u591a\u8eab\u4efd\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5e76\u6267\u884c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668(MMDiT)\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u9519\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\u8868\u793a\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u56fe\u50cf/\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u5668\u3002", "result": "VINO: unified visual generator combining image/video generation and editing in one model; uses shared diffusion backbone conditioned on text/images/videos; couples VLM with Multimodal Diffusion Transformer; interleaved conditioning tokens; supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, identity preservation; multi-stage training pipeline expanding video base to unified generator; shows strong visual quality and controllability across benchmarks.", "conclusion": "VINO\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u9519\u7684\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u66f4\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u8eab\u4efd\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}

Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u8eab\u4efd\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6270\u52a8\u8868\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5df2\u6709\u4f2a\u9020\u6837\u672c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\uff1b\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6f5c\u529b\u5927\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u5230\u5224\u522b\u6027\u8868\u793a\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u8868\u60c5\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f2a\u9020\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u672a\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u97f3\u9891\u5408\u6210\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\uff08\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\uff09\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5b9a\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e3b\u4f53\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u7684\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u8eab\u4efd\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u4e3a\u8be5\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f2a\u9020\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "ExposeAnyone\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u97f3\u9891\u751f\u6210\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\uff08face forgery\uff09\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08DF-TIMIT\u3001DFDCP\u3001KoDF\u3001IDForge\uff09\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747AUC\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e864.22\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230Sora2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u538b\u7f29\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u6270\u52a8\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ExposeAnyone\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u4f2a\u9020\u6837\u672c\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6269\u6563\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u672a\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}
