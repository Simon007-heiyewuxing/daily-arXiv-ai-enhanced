However, their tendency to generate executable SQL for ambiguous, out-of-scope, or unanswerable queries introduces a hidden risk, as outputs may be misinterpreted as correct. This risk is especially serious in biomedical contexts, where precision is critical. We therefore present Query Carefully, a pipeline that integrates LLM-based SQL generation with explicit detection and handling of unanswerable inputs. Building on the OncoMX component of ScienceBenchmark, we construct OncoMX-NAQ (No-Answer Questions), a set of 80 no-answer questions spanning 8 categories (non-SQL, out-of-schema/domain, and multiple ambiguity types). Our approach employs llama3.3:70b with schema-aware prompts, explicit No-Answer Rules (NAR), and few-shot examples drawn from both answerable and unanswerable questions. We evaluate SQL exact match, result accuracy, and unanswerable-detection accuracy. On the OncoMX dev split, few-shot prompting with answerable examples increases result accuracy, and adding unanswerable examples does not degrade performance. On OncoMX-NAQ, balanced prompting achieves the highest unanswerable-detection accuracy (0.8), with near-perfect results for structurally defined categories (non-SQL, missing columns, out-of-domain) but persistent challenges for missing-value queries (0.5) and column ambiguity (0.3).

Wang", "Joy Hsu", "Jiajun Wu", "Ehsan Adeli"], "title": "A Tool Bottleneck Framework for Clinically-Informed and Interpretable Medical Image Understanding", "comment": null, "summary": "Recent tool-use frameworks powered by vision-language models (VLMs) improve image understanding by grounding model predictions with specialized tools. Broadly, these frameworks leverage VLMs and a pre-specified toolbox to decompose the prediction task into multiple tool calls (often deep learning models) which are composed to make a prediction. The dominant approach to composing tools is using text, via function calls embedded in VLM-generated code or natural language. However, these methods often perform poorly on medical image understanding, where salient information is encoded as spatially-localized features that are difficult to compose or fuse via text alone. To address this, we propose a tool-use framework for medical image understanding called the Tool Bottleneck Framework (TBF), which composes VLM-selected tools using a learned Tool Bottleneck Model (TBM). For a given image and task, TBF leverages an off-the-shelf medical VLM to select tools from a toolbox that each extract clinically-relevant features. Instead of text-based composition, these tools are composed by the TBM, which computes and fuses the tool outputs using a neural network before outputting the final prediction. We propose a simple and effective strategy for TBMs to make predictions with any arbitrary VLM tool selection. Overall, our framework not only improves tool-use in medical imaging contexts, but also yields more interpretable, clinically-grounded predictors. We evaluate TBF on tasks in histopathology and dermatology and find that these advantages enable our framework to perform on par with or better than deep learning-based classifiers, VLMs, and state-of-the-art tool-use frameworks, with particular gains in data-limited regimes.

Existing fusion algorithms generally assume that, for every spatial location in the scene, there is at least one input image in which that location is in focus. Furthermore, current fusion models often suffer from edge artifacts caused by uncertain focus estimation or hard-selection operations in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a generative multi-focus image fusion framework, termed GMFF, which operates in two sequential stages. In the first stage, deterministic fusion is implemented using StackMFF V4, the latest version of the StackMFF series, and integrates the available focal plane information to produce an initial fused image. The second stage, generative restoration, is realized through IFControlNet, which leverages the generative capabilities of latent diffusion models to reconstruct content from missing focal planes, restore fine details, and eliminate edge artifacts.

Unlike humans, who effortlessly infer intentions, beliefs, emotions, and social norms from brief visual cues, current models tend to render literal scenes without capturing the underlying causal or psychological logic. To systematically evaluate this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for social reasoning in video generation. Grounded in findings from developmental and social psychology, our benchmark organizes thirty classic social cognition paradigms into seven core dimensions, including mental-state inference, goal-directed action, joint attention, social coordination, prosocial behavior, social norms, and multi-agent strategy. To operationalize these paradigms, we develop a fully training-free agent-based pipeline that (i) distills the reasoning mechanism of each experiment, (ii) synthesizes diverse video-ready scenarios, (iii) enforces conceptual neutrality and difficulty control through cue-based critique, and (iv) evaluates generated videos using a high-capacity VLM judge across five interpretable dimensions of social reasoning. Using this framework, we conduct the first large-scale study across seven state-of-the-art video generation systems. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps: while modern models excel in surface-level plausibility, they systematically fail in intention recognition, belief reasoning, joint attention, and prosocial inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9996\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4f1a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0e\u53d1\u5c55\u5fc3\u7406\u5b66\uff0c\u6784\u5efa30\u4e2a\u8303\u4f8b\u30017\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u96f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u7ebf\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u60c5\u666f\u5e76\u7528\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cfVLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5bf97\u4e2a\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u9762\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u610f\u56fe\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5171\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u4e0e\u5229\u4ed6\u63a8\u65ad\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u903c\u771f\u6027\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u8fdb\u6b65\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5177\u5907\u793e\u4f1a\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u63ed\u793a\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u51c6\u753130\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u8303\u5f0f\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u5f52\u5165\u4e03\u5927\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5fc3\u667a\u63a8\u65ad\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u5171\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u3001\u793e\u4ea4\u534f\u4f5c\u3001\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u3001\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7ba1\u7ebf\uff1a\u63d0\u53d6\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3001\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6837\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u573a\u666f\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u7d22\u6279\u5224\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7acb\u4e0e\u96be\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\uff0c\u6cbf\u4e94\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5bf9\u4e03\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f00\u5c55\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8868\u5c42\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff08\u6bd4\u5982\u7269\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u4e0a\u5f97\u5206\u8f83\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3001\u5171\u540c\u6ce8\u610f\u4e0e\u4eb2\u793e\u4f1a\u63a8\u65ad\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u666e\u904d\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5b66\u5230\u793e\u4f1a\u56e0\u679c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\u96c6\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u793e\u533a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u610f\u56fe\u3001\u4fe1\u5ff5\u4e0e\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u8303\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Under a fixed parameter budget (2.37M parameters, 2.51% of total), all PET variants achieve AUROC between 0.892 and 0.908, outperforming full fine-tuning (0.770 AUROC), which uses 94.3M trainable parameters, a 40x reduction.

Existing methods optimize single metrics without addressing deployment-critical factors such as operating point selection and fixed-threshold robustness. This work addresses misleading robustness estimates by introducing a fixed-threshold evaluation protocol that holds decision thresholds, selected once on clean validation data, fixed across all post-processing transformations. Traditional methods retune thresholds per condition, artificially inflating robustness estimates and masking deployment failures. We report deployment-relevant performance at three operating points (Low-FPR, ROC-optimal, Best-F1) under systematic degradation testing using a lightweight CNN-ViT hybrid with gated fusion and optional frequency enhancement. Our evaluation exposes a statistically validated forensic-semantic spectrum: frequency-aided CNNs excel on pristine photos but collapse under compression (93.33% to 61.49%), whereas ViTs degrade minimally (92.86% to 88.36%) through robust semantic pattern recognition.

Although data-driven polarization-based underwater 3D reconstruction methods show great potential, existing public datasets lack sufficient diversity in scattering and observation conditions, hindering fair comparisons among different approaches, including single-view and multi-view polarization imaging methods.\n  To address this limitation, we construct MuS-Polar3D, a benchmark dataset comprising polarization images of 42 objects captured under seven quantitatively controlled scattering conditions and five viewpoints, together with high-precision 3D models (+/- 0.05 mm accuracy), normal maps, and foreground masks. The dataset supports multiple vision tasks, including normal estimation, object segmentation, descattering, and 3D reconstruction.\n  Inspired by computational imaging, we further decouple underwater 3D reconstruction under scattering into a two-stage pipeline, namely descattering followed by 3D reconstruction, from an imaging-chain perspective. Extensive evaluations using multiple baseline methods under complex scattering conditions demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed benchmark, achieving a best mean angular error of 15.49 degrees.

However, in the later stages of training, the model tends to produce homogenized outputs, lacking creativity and visual diversity, which restricts its application scenarios. This issue can be analyzed from both reward modeling and generation dynamics perspectives. First, traditional GRPO relies on single-sample quality as the reward signal, driving the model to converge toward a few high-reward generation modes while neglecting distribution-level diversity. Second, conventional GRPO regularization neglects the dominant role of early-stage denoising in preserving diversity, causing a misaligned regularization budget that limits the achievable quality--diversity trade-off. Motivated by these insights, we revisit the diversity degradation problem from both reward modeling and generation dynamics. At the reward level, we propose a distributional creativity bonus based on semantic grouping. Specifically, we construct a distribution-level representation via spectral clustering over samples generated from the same caption, and adaptively allocate exploratory rewards according to group sizes to encourage the discovery of novel visual modes. At the generation level, we introduce a structure-aware regularization, which enforces stronger early-stage constraints to preserve diversity without compromising reward optimization efficiency.

However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \\textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices.

Recent dataset-free approaches that redirect self-attention inside the mask fail in two ways: non-target foregrounds are often misinterpreted as background, which regenerates unwanted objects, and direct attention manipulation disrupts fine details and hinders coherent integration of background cues. We propose EraseLoRA, a novel dataset-free framework that replaces attention surgery with background-aware reasoning and test-time adaptation. First, Background-aware Foreground Exclusion (BFE), uses a multimodal large-language models to separate target foreground, non-target foregrounds, and clean background from a single image-mask pair without paired supervision, producing reliable background cues while excluding distractors. Second, Background-aware Reconstruction with Subtype Aggregation (BRSA), performs test-time optimization that treats inferred background subtypes as complementary pieces and enforces their consistent integration through reconstruction and alignment objectives, preserving local detail and global structure without explicit attention intervention. We validate EraseLoRA as a plug-in to pretrained diffusion models and across benchmarks for object removal, demonstrating consistent improvements over dataset-free baselines and competitive results against dataset-driven methods.

Through this process, we identify the root causes of the reproducibility dilemma in the field: firstly, papers often omit implicit details such as prepro cessing steps and parameter settings; secondly, most detec tion methods overfit to exclusive features of specific gener ators rather than learning universal intrinsic features of AIGC images. Experimental results show that basic perfor mance can be reproduced when strictly following the core procedures described in the original papers.

We discover that knowledge distillation improves students' capability as a complement to Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) on window sizes (anchored from large models). Building on this insight, we propose LAid, which directly aims at the transfer of long-range attention mechanisms through two complementary components: (1) a progressive distance-weighted attention matching that dynamically emphasizes longer position differences during training, and (2) a learnable RoPE response gain modulation that selectively amplifies position sensitivity where needed. Extensive experiments across multiple model families demonstrate that LAid-distilled models achieve up to 3.2 times longer effective context windows compared to baseline small models, while maintaining or improving performance on standard VL benchmarks. Spectral analysis also suggests that LAid successfully preserves crucial low-frequency attention components that conventional methods fail to transfer.

However, existing methods for accurate, robust, and resource-efficient lesion analysis have limitations, including low performance and high computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose UltraLBM-UNet, a lightweight U-Net variant that integrates a bidirectional Mamba-based global modeling mechanism with multi-branch local feature perception. The proposed architecture integrates efficient local feature injection with bidirectional state-space modeling, enabling richer contextual interaction across spatial dimensions while maintaining computational compactness suitable for point-of-care deployment. Extensive experiments on the ISIC 2017, ISIC 2018, and PH2 datasets demonstrate that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, outperforming existing lightweight and Mamba counterparts with only 0.034M parameters and 0.060 GFLOPs. In addition, we introduce a hybrid knowledge distillation strategy to train an ultra-compact student model, where the distilled variant UltraLBM-UNet-T, with only 0.011M parameters and 0.019 GFLOPs, achieves competitive segmentation performance.

Accepted by KDD 2026 research track. Codes are released at https://github.com/Jian-Lang/ALARM", "summary": "The proliferation of harmful memes on online media poses significant risks to public health and stability. Existing detection methods heavily rely on large-scale labeled data for training, which necessitates substantial manual annotation efforts and limits their adaptability to the continually evolving nature of harmful content. To address these challenges, we present ALARM, the first lAbeL-free hARmful Meme detection framework powered by Large Multimodal Model (LMM) agent self-improvement. The core innovation of ALARM lies in exploiting the expressive information from \"shallow\" memes to iteratively enhance its ability to tackle more complex and subtle ones. ALARM consists of a novel Confidence-based Explicit Meme Identification mechanism that isolates the explicit memes from the original dataset and assigns them pseudo-labels. Besides, a new Pairwise Learning Guided Agent Self-Improvement paradigm is introduced, where the explicit memes are reorganized into contrastive pairs (positive vs. negative) to refine a learner LMM agent.

However, existing methods and benchmarks focus on the simple, context-agnostic visual identification and textual replacement of the personalized concept (e.g., \"A yellow puppy\" -> \"Your puppy Mochi\"), overlooking the ability to support long-context conversations. An ideal personalized MLLM assistant is capable of engaging in long-context dialogues with humans and continually improving its experience quality by learning from past dialogue histories. To bridge this gap, we propose LCMP, the first Long-Context MLLM Personalization evaluation benchmark. LCMP assesses the capability of MLLMs in perceiving variations of personalized concepts and generating contextually appropriate personalized responses that reflect these variations. As a strong baseline for LCMP, we introduce a novel training-free and state-aware framework TAME. TAME endows MLLMs with double memories to manage the temporal and persistent variations of each personalized concept in a differentiated manner. In addition, TAME incorporates a new training-free Retrieve-then-Align Augmented Generation (RA2G) paradigm. RA2G introduces an alignment step to extract the contextually fitted information from the multi-memory retrieved knowledge to the current questions, enabling better interactions for complex real-world user queries.

Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.", "AI": {"tldr": "SymDrive\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u7ebf\u6062\u590d\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6062\u590d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u573a\u666f\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u89c6\u56fe\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u611f3D\u8f66\u8f86\u63d2\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4eff\u771f\u5728\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4ea4\u901a\u7f16\u8f91\u95f4\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89d2\u5ea6\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8d44\u4ea7\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u6216\u5149\u7167\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u96be\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSymDrive\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u7ebf\u6062\u590d\uff08\u6784\u9020\u6210\u5bf9\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u503c\u6307\u5bfc\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4fa7\u5411\u89c6\u56fe\uff09\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u8f66\u8f86\u63d2\u5165\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4fee\u8865\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u9634\u5f71\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSymDrive\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e3D\u8f66\u8f86\u63d2\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u5149\u7167\u534f\u8c03\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SymDrive\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5728\u7ebf\u6062\u590d\u8303\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f66\u8f86\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u9634\u5f71\u534f\u8c03\u3002"}}

We demonstrate that only a small fraction of latent features are actively used in each layer, and that the geometric properties of the model's feature manifold, including intrinsic dimensionality, curvature, and feature selectivity, vary systematically with different types of deepfake artifacts. These insights provide a first step toward opening the \"black box\" of deepfake detectors, allowing us to identify which learned features correspond to specific forensic artifacts and to guide the development of more interpretable and robust models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528SAE\u548c\u6cd5\u533b\u6d41\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u8bfb\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6df1\u4f2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c11\u91cf\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\uff08\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u66f2\u7387\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\uff09\u968f\u4f2a\u9020\u75d5\u8ff9\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u6539\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6df1\u4f2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5185\u90e8\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u63ed\u793a\u54ea\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u6cd5\u533b\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5e94\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u52a8\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u7684\u6cd5\u533b\u75d5\u8ff9\u64cd\u63a7\uff08\u5982\u8272\u5f69\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u9891\u57df\u6b8b\u7559\uff09\u5e76\u6d4b\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u66f2\u7387\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u64cd\u63a7\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6bcf\u5c42\u4ec5\u5c11\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u88ab\u79ef\u6781\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u5c5e\u6027\u968f\u7740\u4e0d\u540c\u4f2a\u9020\u75d5\u8ff9\u7c7b\u578b\u5448\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53ef\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5177\u4f53\u6cd5\u533b\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6307\u5f15\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0e\u6cd5\u533b\u6d41\u5f62\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63ed\u793a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6df1\u4f2a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5c11\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6bcf\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u4e14\u7279\u5f81\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u6df1\u4f2a\u4f2a\u9020\u75d5\u8ff9\u7c7b\u578b\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, which inadvertently limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. To address this, we present Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph), a framework that leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior. We represent image features as graphs, with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. A Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer is proposed to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling through explicit node interactions. Building upon SPG layers, we introduce a Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. Furthermore, we design a Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in the graph space.

Using the SlideChain Slides Dataset-a curated corpus of 1,117 medical imaging lecture slides from a university course-we extract concepts and relational triples from four state-of-the-art VLMs and construct structured provenance records for every slide.

Through the first systematic analysis of semantic disagreement, cross-model similarity, and lecture-level variability in multimodal educational content, we reveal pronounced cross-model discrepancies, including low concept overlap and near-zero agreement in relational triples on many slides. We further evaluate gas usage, throughput, and scalability under simulated deployment conditions, and demonstrate perfect tamper detection along with deterministic reproducibility across independent extraction runs.

To overcome the challenges of segmenting fluid regions in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images-notably ambiguous boundaries and cross-device heterogeneity-this study introduces Prior-AttUNet, a segmentation model augmented with generative anatomical priors. The framework adopts a hybrid dual-path architecture that integrates a generative prior pathway with a segmentation network. A variational autoencoder supplies multi-scale normative anatomical priors, while the segmentation backbone incorporates densely connected blocks and spatial pyramid pooling modules to capture richer contextual information. Additionally, a novel triple-attention mechanism, guided by anatomical priors, dynamically modulates feature importance across decoding stages, substantially enhancing boundary delineation.

Existing methods grapple with two primary limitations: i) Inflexible spatiotemporal representation due to reliance on positional encodings for capturing spatiotemporal information. ii) High computational costs stemming from the quadratic time complexity of conventional attention mechanisms. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Spatiotemporal-Untrammelled Mixture of Experts (ST-MoE), which flexibly explores complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion and significantly reduces computational cost. To adaptively mine complex spatio-temporal patterns from human motion, our model incorporates four distinct types of spatiotemporal experts, each specializing in capturing different spatial or temporal dependencies.

This challenge is most acute for autonomous UAVs in dense urban environments, where foreseeing events from high-resolution imagery is non-negotiable for safety. Existing methods, reliant on iterative generation (diffusion, autoregressive models) or quadratic-complexity attention, fail to meet these stringent demands on edge hardware. To break this long-standing trade-off, we introduce RAPTOR, a video prediction architecture that achieves real-time, high-resolution performance. RAPTOR's single-pass design avoids the error accumulation and latency of iterative approaches. Its core innovation is Efficient Video Attention (EVA), a novel translator module that factorizes spatiotemporal modeling. Instead of processing flattened spacetime tokens with $O((ST)^2)$ or $O(ST)$ complexity, EVA alternates operations along the spatial (S) and temporal (T) axes. This factorization reduces the time complexity to $O(S + T)$ and memory complexity to $O(max(S, T))$, enabling global context modeling at $512^2$ resolution and beyond, operating directly on dense feature maps with a patch-free design. Complementing this architecture is a 3-stage training curriculum that progressively refines predictions from coarse structure to sharp, temporally coherent details. Experiments show RAPTOR is the first predictor to exceed 30 FPS on a Jetson AGX Orin for $512^2$ video, setting a new state-of-the-art on UAVid, KTH, and a custom high-resolution dataset in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

We propose AstraNav-World, an end-to-end world model that jointly reasons about future visual states and action sequences within a unified probabilistic framework. Our framework integrates a diffusion-based video generator with a vision-language policy, enabling synchronized rollouts where predicted scenes and planned actions are updated simultaneously. Training optimizes two complementary objectives: generating action-conditioned multi-step visual predictions and deriving trajectories conditioned on those predicted visuals. This bidirectional constraint makes visual predictions executable and keeps decisions grounded in physically consistent, task-relevant futures, mitigating cumulative errors common in decoupled \"envision-then-plan\" pipelines. Experiments across diverse embodied navigation benchmarks show improved trajectory accuracy and higher success rates. Ablations confirm the necessity of tight vision-action coupling and unified training, with either branch removal degrading both prediction quality and policy reliability. In real-world testing, AstraNav-World demonstrated exceptional zero-shot capabilities, adapting to previously unseen scenarios without any real-world fine-tuning. These results suggest that AstraNav-World captures transferable spatial understanding and planning-relevant navigation dynamics, rather than merely overfitting to simulation-specific data distribution. Overall, by unifying foresight vision and control within a single generative model, we move closer to reliable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied agents that operate robustly in open-ended real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAstraNav-World\uff1a\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u7b56\u7565\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u53cc\u5411\u7ea6\u675f\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u7d2f\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bfc\u822a\u8868\u73b0\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6b21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u4f5c\u5982\u4f55\u5c55\u5f00\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u201c\u5148\u60f3\u8c61\u540e\u89c4\u5212\u201d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u4e0e\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u524d\u77bb\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u51b3\u7b56\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u540c\u6b65\u6eda\u52a8\uff08predicted scenes \u4e0e planned actions \u5171\u540c\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002\u53cc\u5411\u635f\u5931\u7ea6\u675f\u4f7f\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u4e14\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u9879\u6a21\u62df\u5bfc\u822a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cAstraNav-World\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u5230\u4e86\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "AstraNav-World\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u672a\u6765\u4e0e\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6eda\u52a8\u63a8\u6f14\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u4e00\u5b9a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A \"running ahead\" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence.

Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio.

This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by proposing an Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion Network (A-QCF-Net) that learns a single unified segmentation model from completely separate and unpaired CT and MRI cohorts. The architecture exploits the parameter efficiency and expressive power of Quaternion Neural Networks to construct a shared feature space. At its core is the Adaptive Quaternion Cross-Fusion (A-QCF) block, a data driven attention module that enables bidirectional knowledge transfer between the two streams. By learning to modulate the flow of information dynamically, the A-QCF block allows the network to exchange abstract modality specific expertise, such as the sharp anatomical boundary information available in CT and the subtle soft tissue contrast provided by MRI. This mutual exchange regularizes and enriches the feature representations of both streams. We validate the framework by jointly training a single model on the unpaired LiTS (CT) and ATLAS (MRI) datasets. The jointly trained model achieves Tumor Dice scores of 76.7% on CT and 78.3% on MRI, significantly exceeding the strong unimodal nnU-Net baseline by margins of 5.4% and 4.7% respectively. Furthermore, comprehensive explainability analysis using Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++ confirms that the model correctly focuses on relevant pathological structures, ensuring the learned representations are clinically meaningful.

Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faBertsWin\uff1a\u57283D\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4ee5\u5168\u91cftoken\u7f51\u683c\uff08\u542b\u63a9\u7801token\uff09+\u5355\u7ea7Swin\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5148\u635f\u5931\u4e0eGradientConductor\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u4e49\u6536\u655b\u52a0\u901f5.8\u00d7\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e0b\u964d15\u00d7\uff0844 vs 660\uff09\uff0c\u5728FLOPs\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7a00\u758fViT\u53ef\u6bd4\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6ViT-MAE\u57283D\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u5927\u91cftoken\u88ab\u4e22\u5f03\uff08\u598275%\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u53ea\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u89c1\u533a\u57df\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBertsWin\uff1a1) \u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u65743D\u7f51\u683c\uff08\u5305\u542b\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c1token\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ef4\u62a4\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u7ea7\u5c40\u90e8Swin\u7a97\u53e3\u66ff\u4ee3\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ee5\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b3) \u91c7\u7528BERT\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5168token\u63a9\u7801\u673a\u5236\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4f18\u5148\u635f\u5931\uff1b4) \u5f15\u5165GradientConductor\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u989e\u4e0b\u988c\u5173\u8282\u9525\u5f62\u675fCT\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5efa\u548c3D\u5206\u5272\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cBertsWin\u4f7f\u8bed\u4e49\u6536\u655b\u52a0\u901f5.8\u00d7\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u914d\u5408GradientConductor\u65f6\u5c06\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6240\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f6e\u6b21\u4ece660\u964d\u81f344\uff0815\u00d7\u51cf\u5c11\uff09\uff1b\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u7406\u8bbaFLOPs\u4e0e\u7a00\u758fViT\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u56e0\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u800c\u603b\u4f53\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "BertsWin\u901a\u8fc7\u57283D\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Swin\u7a97\u53e3\u7684BERT\u98ce\u683c\u63a9\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u6536\u655b\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u8fbe\u5230\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u7406\u8bbaFLOPs\u4e0a\u4e0e\u7a00\u758fViT\u57fa\u7ebf\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u603b\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u3002"}}

Bors"], "title": "Inference-based GAN Video Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "Video generation has seen remarkable progresses thanks to advancements in generative deep learning. Generated videos should not only display coherent and continuous movement but also meaningful movement in successions of scenes. Generating models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and more recently Diffusion Networks have been used for generating short video sequences, usually of up to 16 frames. In this paper, we first propose a new type of video generator by enabling adversarial-based unconditional video generators with a variational encoder, akin to a VAE-GAN hybrid structure, in order to enable the generation process with inference capabilities. The proposed model, as in other video deep learning-based processing frameworks, incorporates two processing branches, one for content and another for movement. However, existing models struggle with the temporal scaling of the generated videos. In classical approaches when aiming to increase the generated video length, the resulting video quality degrades, particularly when considering generating significantly long sequences. To overcome this limitation, our research study extends the initially proposed VAE-GAN video generation model by employing a novel, memory-efficient approach to generate long videos composed of hundreds or thousands of frames ensuring their temporal continuity, consistency and dynamics. Our approach leverages a Markov chain framework with a recall mechanism, with each state representing a VAE-GAN short-length video generator. This setup allows for the sequential connection of generated video sub-sequences, enabling temporal dependencies, resulting in meaningful long video sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdVAE-GAN\u6df7\u5408\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe+\u56de\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u591a\u4e2a\u77ed\u7247\u6bb5\u4e32\u8054\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6570\u767e\u5230\u6570\u5343\u5e27\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u77ed\u5e8f\u5217\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5ef6\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u65f6\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u63a8\u65ad\u7f16\u7801\u4e5f\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaVAE-GAN\u6df7\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u652f\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u652f\u4ee5\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5c06\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u7684\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u56de\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff08\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\uff0c\u6309\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u8fde\u63a5\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u6570\u767e\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u5e27\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u76f8\u8fde\u77ed\u7247\u6bb5\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u968f\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\u800c\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u8bba\u6587\u5ba3\u79f0\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5e27\u6570\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6548\u679c\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u63a8\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u4e0e\u56de\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u4e86VAE-GAN\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6570\u767e\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u5e27\u4e14\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present Scene-VLM, the first fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM) framework for video scene segmentation. Scene-VLM jointly processes visual and textual cues including frames, transcriptions, and optional metadata to enable multimodal reasoning across consecutive shots. The model generates predictions sequentially with causal dependencies among shots and introduces a context-focus window mechanism to ensure sufficient temporal context for each shot-level decision. In addition, we propose a scheme to extract confidence scores from the token-level logits of the VLM, enabling controllable precision-recall trade-offs that were previously limited to encoder-based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our model can be aligned to generate coherent natural-language rationales for its boundary decisions through minimal targeted supervision.

The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks.

It affects poor and rural communities and presents medical challenges and socioeconomic burdens on patients and healthcare systems in endemic regions worldwide. Mycetoma diagnosis is a major challenge in mycetoma management, particularly in low-resource settings where expert pathologists are limited. To address this challenge, this paper presents an overview of the Mycetoma MicroImage: Detect and Classify Challenge (mAIcetoma) which was organized to advance mycetoma diagnosis through AI solutions. mAIcetoma focused on developing automated models for segmenting mycetoma grains and classifying mycetoma types from histopathological images. The challenge attracted the attention of several teams worldwide to participate and five finalist teams fulfilled the challenge objectives. The teams proposed various deep learning architectures for the ultimate goal of this challenge.

We implement a likelihood-guided sampling procedure that combines an unconditional diffusion prior with gradient-based conditioning to enforce measurement consistency for $4\\times$ super-resolution with additive Gaussian noise. We evaluate posterior sampling (PS) conditioning across guidance scales and noise levels, using PSNR and SSIM as fidelity metrics and a combined selection score $(\\mathrm{PSNR}/40)+\\mathrm{SSIM}$. Our ablation shows that moderate guidance improves reconstruction quality, with the best configuration achieved at PS scale $0.95$ and noise standard deviation $\u03c3=0.01$ (score $1.45231$). Qualitative results confirm that the selected PS setting restores sharper edges and more coherent facial details compared to the downsampled inputs, while alternative conditioning strategies (e.g., MCG and PS-annealed) exhibit different texture fidelity trade-offs. These findings highlight the importance of balancing diffusion priors and measurement-gradient strength to obtain stable, high-quality reconstructions without retraining the diffusion model for each operator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5df2\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u4e0b\u76844\u00d7\u5355\u56fe\u8d85\u5206\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u5f15\u5bfc\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5728PS=0.95, \u03c3=0.01\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08SISR\uff09\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4f3c\u7136\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\uff08posterior sampling, PS\uff09\u7528\u4e8e4\u00d7\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff08guidance scale\uff09\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u03c3\u5bf9\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PSNR\u3001SSIM\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6307\u6807(PSNR/40)+SSIM\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u8c03\u8282\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982MCG\u3001PS-annealed\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e2d\u7b49\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u914d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5c3a\u5ea6PS=0.95\u548c\u03c3=0.01\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7ec4\u5408\u8bc4\u52061.45231\u3002\u8d28\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u80fd\u5728\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u8fb9\u7f18\u548c\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u9762\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u800c\u5176\u4ed6\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7eb9\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6d4b\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f3c\u7136\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes.

Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2].\n  The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Paper applies CNNs to multi-dimensional raw stock data (treated like images) including splits/dividends, achieving promising results for predicting S&P500 stock movements, enabling per-stock/sector/portfolio predictions.", "motivation": "Leverage deep learning (CNN) strengths from image processing to handle complex, multivariate financial time-series without heavy feature engineering, better capturing real-world events and enabling improved stock movement prediction.", "method": "Convolutional Neural Network on multivariate raw stock data (including splits/dividends) treated as image-like matrices", "result": "Model applied CNN to historical multi-dimensional stock data; trained to predict next movement for S&P 500 constituents; reports promising accuracy (not quantified in abstract) and supports predictions per-stock, per-sector, or portfolio-level", "conclusion": "Using CNN on raw multivariate market data is feasible and yields promising predictive performance; approach avoids heavy feature engineering and can incorporate real-world events like splits/dividends"}}

Entropy, a measure of model uncertainty, is strongly correlated with the reliability of VLM. Prior entropy-based attacks maximize uncertainty at all decoding steps, implicitly assuming that every token contributes equally to generation instability. We show instead that a small fraction (about 20%) of high-entropy tokens, i.e., critical decision points in autoregressive generation, disproportionately governs output trajectories. By concentrating adversarial perturbations on these positions, we achieve semantic degradation comparable to global methods while using substantially smaller budgets. More importantly, across multiple representative VLMs, such selective attacks convert 35-49% of benign outputs into harmful ones, exposing a more critical safety risk. Remarkably, these vulnerable high-entropy forks recur across architecturally diverse VLMs, enabling feasible transferability (17-26% harmful rates on unseen targets). Motivated by these findings, we propose Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial attacks (EGA), which achieves competitive attack success rates (93-95%) alongside high harmful conversion, thereby revealing new weaknesses in current VLM safety mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ea620%\u7684\u9ad8\u71b5token\u51b3\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u8d70\u5411\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u96c6\u4e2d\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u7528\u66f4\u5c0f\u9884\u7b97\u628a35\u201349%\u6b63\u5e38\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u4e3a\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0cEGA\u8fbe93\u201395%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6709\u5bb3\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u7b49\u6743\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5c11\u6570\u5173\u952e\u51b3\u7b56\u70b9\u7684\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9ad8\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6bcf\u6b65\u71b5\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6392\u540d\u9760\u524d\u7684\u9ad8\u71b5token\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08\u7ea620%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u96c6\u4e2d\u65bd\u52a0\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1Entropy-bank Guided Adversarial (EGA)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u71b5\u94f6\u884c\u4ee5\u8bb0\u5f55\u8de8\u8f93\u5165/\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u71b5\u53c9\u70b9\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u964d\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5c0635\u201349%\u6b63\u5e38\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u5bb3\uff1b\u9ad8\u71b5\u53c9\u70b9\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784VLM\u95f4\u590d\u73b0\uff0c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u53ef\u4f7f17\u201326%\u8f93\u51fa\u53d8\u4e3a\u6709\u5bb3\uff1bEGA\u603b\u4f53\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe93\u201395%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0VLM\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5c11\u6570\u9ad8\u71b5 token \u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u53c9\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u66f4\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u964d\u89e3\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u8f6c\u5316\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u73b0\u6027\u9ad8\uff0c\u63d0\u51faEGA\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper proposes XET-V2X, a multi-modal fused end-to-end tracking framework for v2x collaboration that unifies multi-view multimodal sensing within a shared spatiotemporal representation. To efficiently align heterogeneous viewpoints and modalities, XET-V2X introduces a dual-layer spatial cross-attention module based on multi-scale deformable attention.

Existing methods can effectively extend the model for new tasks while freezing the parameters of the old model, but ignore the necessity of structural efficiency to lead to the feature difference between modules and the class misalignment due to evolving class distributions. To address these issues, we propose scalable class-incremental learning based on parametric neural collapse (SCL-PNC) that enables demand-driven, minimal-cost backbone expansion by adapt-layer and refines the static into a dynamic parametric Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) framework according to incremental class. This method can efficiently handle the model expansion question with the increasing number of categories in real-world scenarios. Additionally, to counteract feature drift in serial expansion models, the parallel expansion framework is presented with a knowledge distillation algorithm to align features across expansion modules. Therefore, SCL-PNC can not only design a dynamic and extensible ETF classifier to address class misalignment due to evolving class distributions, but also ensure feature consistency by an adapt-layer with knowledge distillation between extended modules. By leveraging neural collapse, SCL-PNC induces the convergence of the incremental expansion model through a structured combination of the expandable backbone, adapt-layer, and the parametric ETF classifier. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhangchuangxin71-cyber/dynamic_ ETF2.

To address this issue, we propose an efficient RGB-T SOD method for real-world unaligned image pairs, termed Thin-Plate Spline-driven Semantic Correlation Learning Network (TPS-SCL). We employ a dual-stream MobileViT as the encoder, combined with efficient Mamba scanning mechanisms, to effectively model correlations between the two modalities while maintaining low parameter counts and computational overhead. To suppress interference from redundant background information during alignment, we design a Semantic Correlation Constraint Module (SCCM) to hierarchically constrain salient features. Furthermore, we introduce a Thin-Plate Spline Alignment Module (TPSAM) to mitigate spatial discrepancies between modalities. Additionally, a Cross-Modal Correlation Module (CMCM) is incorporated to fully explore and integrate inter-modal dependencies, enhancing detection performance.

We identify a key obstacle in applying speculative decoding to visual AR models: inconsistent acceptance rates across draft trees due to varying prediction difficulties in different image regions. We propose Adjacency-Adaptive Dynamical Draft Trees (ADT-Tree), an adjacency-adaptive dynamic draft tree that dynamically adjusts draft tree depth and width by leveraging adjacent token states and prior acceptance rates. ADT-Tree initializes via horizontal adjacency, then refines depth/width via bisectional adaptation, yielding deeper trees in simple regions and wider trees in complex ones. The empirical evaluations on MS-COCO 2017 and PartiPrompts demonstrate that ADT-Tree achieves speedups of 3.13xand 3.05x, respectively. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly with relaxed sampling methods such as LANTERN, enabling further acceleration.

This work investigates whether feature-level fusion of complementary convolutional neural network (CNN) backbones can deliver accurate and efficient binary DR screening on globally sourced fundus images. Using 11,156 images pooled from five public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, IDRiD, Messidor, and ODIR), we frame DR detection as a binary classification task and compare three pretrained models (ResNet50, EfficientNet-B0, and DenseNet121) against pairwise and tri-fusion variants. Across five independent runs, fusion consistently outperforms single backbones. The EfficientNet-B0 + DenseNet121 (Eff+Den) fusion model achieves the best overall mean performance (accuracy: 82.89\\%) with balanced class-wise F1-scores for normal (83.60\\%) and diabetic (82.60\\%) cases. While the tri-fusion is competitive, it incurs a substantially higher computational cost. Inference profiling highlights a practical trade-off: EfficientNet-B0 is the fastest (approximately 1.16 ms/image at batch size 1000), whereas the Eff+Den fusion offers a favorable accuracy--latency balance.

Our key insight is that, if a video inpainting model can be finetuned to remove the foreground-associated effects, then it must be inherently capable of perceiving these effects, and hence can also be finetuned for the complementary task: foreground layer decomposition with associated effects. However, although na\u00efvely finetuning the inpainting model with LoRA applied to all blocks can produce high-quality alpha mattes, it fails to capture associated effects. Our systematic analysis reveals this arises because effect-related cues are primarily encoded in specific DiT blocks and become suppressed when LoRA is applied across all blocks. To address this, we introduce EasyOmnimatte, the first unified, end-to-end video omnimatte method. Concretely, we finetune a pretrained video inpainting diffusion model to learn dual complementary experts while keeping its original weights intact: an Effect Expert, where LoRA is applied only to effect-sensitive DiT blocks to capture the coarse structure of the foreground and associated effects, and a fully LoRA-finetuned Quality Expert learns to refine the alpha matte. During sampling, Effect Expert is used for denoising at early, high-noise steps, while Quality Expert takes over at later, low-noise steps. This design eliminates the need for two full diffusion passes, significantly reducing computational cost without compromising output quality. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of this Dual-Expert strategy.

We present DPAR, a novel decoder-only autoregressive model that dynamically aggregates image tokens into a variable number of patches for efficient image generation. Our work is the first to demonstrate that next-token prediction entropy from a lightweight and unsupervised autoregressive model provides a reliable criterion for merging tokens into larger patches based on information content. DPAR makes minimal modifications to the standard decoder architecture, ensuring compatibility with multimodal generation frameworks and allocating more compute to generation of high-information image regions. Further, we demonstrate that training with dynamically sized patches yields representations that are robust to patch boundaries, allowing DPAR to scale to larger patch sizes at inference. DPAR reduces token count by 1.81x and 2.06x on Imagenet 256 and 384 generation resolution respectively, leading to a reduction of up to 40% FLOPs in training costs.

We introduce SLIM-Brain (Sample-efficient, Low-memory fMRI Foundation Model for Human Brain), a new atlas-free foundation model that simultaneously improves both data- and training-efficiency. SLIM-Brain adopts a two-stage adaptive design: (i) a lightweight temporal extractor captures global context across full sequences and ranks data windows by saliency, and (ii) a 4D hierarchical encoder (Hiera-JEPA) learns fine-grained voxel-level representations only from the top-$k$ selected windows, while deleting about 70% masked patches.

Existing approaches mainly estimate relative poses between two images and employ a late-fusion strategy to obtain absolute pose estimates. However, the late motion average is often insufficient for effectively integrating spatial information, and its accuracy degrades in complex environments. In this paper, we present the first visual localization framework that performs multi-view spatial integration through an early-fusion mechanism, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Our framework is built upon the VGGT backbone, which encodes multi-view 3D geometry, and we introduce a pose tokenizer and projection module to more effectively exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse mask attention strategy that reduces computational cost by avoiding the quadratic complexity of global attention, thereby enabling real-time performance at scale. Trained on approximately eight million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments.

In this paper, we propose PAN, the first human-centric graph representation learning framework for multimodal action recognition, in which token embeddings of RGB patches containing human joints are represented as spatiotemporal graphs. The human-centric graph modeling paradigm suppresses the redundancy in RGB frames and aligns well with skeleton-based methods, thus enabling a more effective and semantically coherent fusion of multimodal features. Since the sampling of token embeddings heavily relies on 2D skeletal data, we further propose attention-based post calibration to reduce the dependency on high-quality skeletal data at a minimal cost interms of model performance. To explore the potential of PAN in integrating with skeleton-based methods, we present two variants: PAN-Ensemble, which employs dual-path graph convolution networks followed by late fusion, and PAN-Unified, which performs unified graph representation learning within a single network. On three widely used multimodal action recognition datasets, both PAN-Ensemble and PAN-Unified achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in their respective settings of multimodal fusion: separate and unified modeling, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAN\uff1a\u5c06\u542b\u5173\u8282\u7684RGB token\u6784\u9020\u6210\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u9aa8\u67b6\u6a21\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u540e\u6821\u51c6\u51cf\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u5747\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff08RGB+\u9aa8\u67b6\uff09\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u8005\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7fRGB\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u9aa8\u67b6\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff1a\u7528\u5305\u542b\u5173\u8282\u7684RGB patch token\u6784\u5efa\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\uff1b2) \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u540e\u6821\u51c6\uff1a\u5728token\u91c7\u6837\u4f9d\u8d562D\u9aa8\u67b6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6821\u51c6\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9aa8\u67b6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff1b3) \u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff1aPAN-Ensemble\uff08\u53cc\u8def\u5f84GCN+\u540e\u878d\u5408\uff09\u4e0ePAN-Unified\uff08\u5355\u7f51\u7edc\u7edf\u4e00\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PAN\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5305\u542b\u4eba\u4f53\u5173\u8282\u7684RGB patch\u7684token embedding\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u9aa8\u67b6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6291\u5236RGB\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u540e\u6821\u51c6\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u9aa8\u67b6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86PAN-Ensemble\u548cPAN-Unified\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee5\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u878d\u5408RGB\u4e0e\u9aa8\u67b6\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u540e\u6821\u51c6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u8def\u5f84\u5206\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u878d\u5408\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5e76\u5747\u8fbeSOTA\u3002"}}

However, crafting appealing posters and manually optimizing them based on online performance is laborious and resource-consuming. To address this, we introduce AutoPP, an automated pipeline for product poster generation and optimization that eliminates the need for human intervention. Specifically, the generator, relying solely on basic product information, first uses a unified design module to integrate the three key elements of a poster (background, text, and layout) into a cohesive output. Then, an element rendering module encodes these elements into condition tokens, efficiently and controllably generating the product poster. Based on the generated poster, the optimizer enhances its Click-Through Rate (CTR) by leveraging online feedback. It systematically replaces elements to gather fine-grained CTR comparisons and utilizes Isolated Direct Preference Optimization (IDPO) to attribute CTR gains to isolated elements. Our work is supported by AutoPP1M, the largest dataset specifically designed for product poster generation and optimization, which contains one million high-quality posters and feedback collected from over one million users.

Current unsupervised learning methods detect anomalies mainly through reconstructing abnormal images into pseudo-healthy images (PHIs) by normal samples learning and then analyzing differences between images. However, these unsupervised models face two significant limitations: restricted generalizability to multi-modality and multi-center MRIs due to their reliance on the specific imaging information in normal training data, and constrained performance due to abnormal residuals propagated from input images to reconstructed PHIs. To address these limitations, two novel modules are proposed, forming a new PHI reconstruction framework. Firstly, the disentangled representation module is proposed to improve generalizability by decoupling brain MRI into imaging information and essential imaging-invariant anatomical images, ensuring that the reconstruction focuses on the anatomy. Specifically, brain anatomical priors and a differentiable one-hot encoding operator are introduced to constrain the disentanglement results and enhance the disentanglement stability. Secondly, the edge-to-image restoration module is designed to reconstruct high-quality PHIs by restoring the anatomical representation from the high-frequency edge information of anatomical images, and then recoupling the disentangled imaging information. This module not only suppresses abnormal residuals in PHI by reducing abnormal pixels input through edge-only input, but also effectively reconstructs normal regions using the preserved structural details in the edges.

For such an underexplored enhancement task, we first curate images from various sources and construct an unpaired anime scenery dataset with diverse environments and illumination conditions to address the data scarcity. To exploit the power of uncertainty information inherent with the diverse illumination conditions, we propose a Data Relativistic Uncertainty (DRU) framework, motivated by the idea from Relativistic GAN. By analogy with the wave-particle duality of light, our framework interpretably defines and quantifies the illumination uncertainty of dark/bright samples, which is leveraged to dynamically adjust the objective functions to recalibrate the model learning under data uncertainty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DRU framework by training several versions of EnlightenGANs, yielding superior perceptual and aesthetic qualities beyond the state-of-the-art methods that are incapable of learning from data uncertainty perspective.

The idea is to take all pairwise normalized differences from the spectral bands and then build polynomial combinations up to a fixed degree, which gives a structured search space that still keeps the illumination invariance needed in remote sensing. For a sensor with $n$ bands this produces $\\binom{n}{2}$ base normalized differences, and the degree-2 polynomial expansion gives 1,080 candidate features for the 10-band Sentinel-2 configuration we use here. Feature selection methods (ANOVA filtering, recursive elimination, and $L_1$-regularized SVM) then pick out small sets of indices that reach the desired accuracy, so the final models stay simple and easy to interpret. We test the framework on Kochia (\\textit{Bassia scoparia}) detection using Sentinel-2 imagery from Saskatchewan, Canada ($N = 2{,}318$ samples, 2022--2024). A single degree-2 index, the product of two normalized differences from the red-edge bands, already reaches 96.26\\% accuracy, and using eight indices only raises this to 97.70\\%. In every case the chosen features are degree-2 products built from bands $b_4$ through $b_8$, which suggests that the discriminative signal comes from spectral \\emph{interactions} rather than individual band ratios. Because the indices involve only simple arithmetic, they can be deployed directly in platforms like Google Earth Engine.

However, their sensitivity to real-world input perturbations, such as imaging artifacts and textual errors, critically undermines their clinical applicability. Systematic analysis of such noise impact on medical MLLMs remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, while several works have investigated the MLLMs' robustness in general domains, they primarily focus on text modality and rely on costly fine-tuning. They are inadequate to address the complex noise patterns and fulfill the strict safety standards in medicine. To bridge this gap, this work systematically analyzes the impact of various perturbations on medical MLLMs across both visual and textual modalities. Building on our findings, we introduce a training-free Inherent-enhanced Multi-modal Calibration (IMC) framework that leverages MLLMs' inherent denoising capabilities following the perceive-and-calibrate principle for cross-modal robustness enhancement. For the visual modality, we propose a Perturbation-aware Denoising Calibration (PDC) which leverages MLLMs' own vision encoder to identify noise patterns and perform prototype-guided feature calibration. For text denoising, we design a Self-instantiated Multi-agent System (SMS) that exploits the MLLMs' self-assessment capabilities to refine noisy text through a cooperative hierarchy of agents. We construct a benchmark containing 11 types of noise across both image and text modalities on 2 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance across multiple modalities, showing potential to enhance MLLMs' robustness in real clinical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u533b\u7597\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf/\u6587\u672c\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684IMC\uff08PDC + SMS\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u572811\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u30012\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLMs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u6210\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u6587\u672c\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\uff0c\u4e14\u9488\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff1b\u9700\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faIMC\u6846\u67b6: \u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u7528PDC\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u7528\u539f\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\u6821\u51c6\uff1b\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u7528SMS\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u8bc4\u534f\u4f5c\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8bc4\u80fd\u529b\u8fed\u4ee3\u7cbe\u70bc\u566a\u58f0\u6587\u672c\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b11\u7c7b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "This paper evaluates robustness of medical multi-modal LLMs to image/text perturbations and proposes training-free calibration methods (IMC) including PDC for vision and SMS for text.

Deployment is also constrained by limited surgical hardware, so the model must balance accuracy and speed and remain stable under small-batch (even batch-1) training. We propose LMSF-A, a lightweight multi-scale attention framework co-designed across backbone, neck, and head. The backbone uses a C2f-Pro module that combines RepViT-style re-parameterized convolution (RVB) with efficient multi-scale attention (EMA), enabling multi-branch training while collapsing into a single fast path for inference. The neck improves cross-scale consistency and boundary detail using Scale-Sequence Feature Fusion (SSFF) and Triple Feature Encoding (TFE), which strengthens high-resolution features. The head adopts a Lightweight Multi-task Shared Head (LMSH) with shared convolutions and GroupNorm to reduce parameters and support batch-1 stability.

Experiments show that LMSF-A is highly competitive (or even better than) in all evaluation metrics and much lighter than most instance segmentation methods requiring only 1.8M parameters and 8.8 GFLOPs, and it generalizes well to a public teeth benchmark.

However, these explanations often reveal that the models do not align well with human domain knowledge, relying instead on spurious correlations. This might result in brittle behavior once deployed in the real-world. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and efficient method for aligning small task-specific vision models with human domain knowledge by leveraging the generalization capabilities of a Large Vision Language Model (LVLM). Our LVLM-Aided Visual Alignment (LVLM-VA) method provides a bidirectional interface that translates model behavior into natural language and maps human class-level specifications to image-level critiques, enabling effective interaction between domain experts and the model. Our method demonstrates substantial improvement in aligning model behavior with human specifications, as validated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Recent studies attribute these hallucinations to VLMs' over-reliance on linguistic priors and insufficient visual feature integration, proposing heuristic decoding calibration strategies to mitigate them. However, the non-trainable nature of these strategies inherently limits their optimization potential. To this end, we propose an adversarial parametric editing framework for Hallucination mitigation in VLMs, which follows an \\textbf{A}ctivate-\\textbf{L}ocate-\\textbf{E}dit \\textbf{A}dversarially paradigm. Specifically, we first construct an activation dataset that comprises grounded responses (positive samples attentively anchored in visual features) and hallucinatory responses (negative samples reflecting LLM prior bias and internal knowledge artifacts). Next, we identify critical hallucination-prone parameter clusters by analyzing differential hidden states of response pairs. Then, these clusters are fine-tuned using prompts injected with adversarial tuned prefixes that are optimized to maximize visual neglect, thereby forcing the model to prioritize visual evidence over inherent parametric biases. Evaluations on both generative and discriminative VLM tasks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of ALEAHallu in alleviating hallucinations.

However, building agents that are both efficient for high-level tasks and precise for fine-grained interactions remains challenging. GUI agents must perform routine actions efficiently while also handling tasks that demand exact visual grounding, yet existing approaches struggle when accuracy depends on identifying specific interface elements. These MLLMs also remain large and cannot adapt their reasoning depth to the task at hand. In this work, we introduce iSHIFT: Implicit Slow-fast Hybrid Inference with Flexible Tokens, a lightweight agent that integrates latent thinking (implicit chain-of-thought) with a perception control module. iSHIFT enables an MLLM to switch between a slow mode, which leverages detailed visual grounding for high precision and a fast mode that uses global cues for efficiency. Special perception tokens guide attention to relevant screen regions, allowing the model to decide both how to reason and where to focus. Despite its compact 2.5B size, iSHIFT matches state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa iSHIFT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u9690\u5f0f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591a\u6a21\u6001 GUI \u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u201c\u6162\u6a21\u5f0f\u201d\uff08\u7cbe\u7ec6\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff09\u548c\u201c\u5feb\u6a21\u5f0f\u201d\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u7ebf\u7d22\uff09\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u611f\u77e5 token \u5f15\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b2.5B \u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u8fbe\u5230\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u7684 SOTA \u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 MLLM \u5728\u590d\u6742 GUI \u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\uff1a\u5e38\u89c4\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e\u754c\u9762\u5143\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff1b\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u4f53\u91cf\u5927\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa iSHIFT\uff1a\u5728 MLLM \u5185\u90e8\u5f15\u5165\u9690\u5f0f\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\uff08latent thinking\uff09\u4e0e perception control \u6a21\u5757\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u4e24\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u2014\u2014\u6162\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9 grounding \u4e0e\u66f4\u591a\u9690\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u6b65\uff09\u548c\u5feb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u66f4\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u6b8a\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u611f\u77e5 tokens\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u5c4f\u5e55\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u65f6\u51b3\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4ec5\u4e3a 2.5B \u53c2\u6570\uff0ciSHIFT \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fbe\u6210\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "iSHIFT \u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u6162\u5feb\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u611f\u77e5 token\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u53ef\u8c03\u63a8\u7406\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684 GUI \u4ee3\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6784\u5efa\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, current UAV vision-and-language navigation(VLN) methods struggle to model long-horizon spatiotemporal context in complex environments, resulting in inaccurate semantic alignment and unstable path planning. To this end, we propose LongFly, a spatiotemporal context modeling framework for long-horizon UAV VLN. LongFly proposes a history-aware spatiotemporal modeling strategy that transforms fragmented and redundant historical data into structured, compact, and expressive representations. First, we propose the slot-based historical image compression module, which dynamically distills multi-view historical observations into fixed-length contextual representations. Then, the spatiotemporal trajectory encoding module is introduced to capture the temporal dynamics and spatial structure of UAV trajectories. Finally, to integrate existing spatiotemporal context with current observations, we design the prompt-guided multimodal integration module to support time-based reasoning and robust waypoint prediction.

Surprisingly, we find that directly transferring classic backdoor attacks (e.g., BadNet) to VSFMs is almost ineffective, with ASR below 5\\%. To understand this, we study encoder gradients and attention maps and observe that conventional training keeps gradients for clean and triggered samples largely aligned, while attention still focuses on the true object, preventing the encoder from learning a distinct trigger-related representation. To address this challenge, we propose BadVSFM, the first backdoor framework tailored to prompt-driven VSFMs. BadVSFM uses a two-stage strategy: (1) steer the image encoder so triggered frames map to a designated target embedding while clean frames remain aligned with a clean reference encoder; (2) train the mask decoder so that, across prompt types, triggered frame-prompt pairs produce a shared target mask, while clean outputs stay close to a reference decoder. Extensive experiments on two datasets and five VSFMs show that BadVSFM achieves strong, controllable backdoor effects under diverse triggers and prompts while preserving clean segmentation quality. Ablations over losses, stages, targets, trigger settings, and poisoning rates demonstrate robustness to reasonable hyperparameter changes and confirm the necessity of the two-stage design. Finally, gradient-conflict analysis and attention visualizations show that BadVSFM separates triggered and clean representations and shifts attention to trigger regions, while four representative defenses remain largely ineffective, revealing an underexplored vulnerability in current VSFMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": ""}}

MAI-UI establishes new state-of-the-art across GUI grounding and mobile navigation. On grounding benchmarks, it reaches 73.5% on ScreenSpot-Pro, 91.3% on MMBench GUI L2, 70.9% on OSWorld-G, and 49.2% on UI-Vision, surpassing Gemini-3-Pro and Seed1.8 on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

In this work, we propose ProEdit to address this issue both in the attention and the latent aspects. In the attention aspect, we introduce KV-mix, which mixes KV features of the source and the target in the edited region, mitigating the influence of the source image on the editing region while maintaining background consistency. In the latent aspect, we propose Latents-Shift, which perturbs the edited region of the source latent, eliminating the influence of the inverted latent on the sampling.

In this paper, we propose Bi-directional Perceptual Shaping (BiPS), which transforms question-conditioned masked views into bidirectional where-to-look signals that shape perception during training. BiPS first applies a KL-consistency constraint between the original image and an evidence-preserving view that keeps only question-relevant regions, encouraging coarse but complete coverage of supporting pixels. It then applies a KL-separation constraint between the original and an evidence-ablated view where critical pixels are masked so the image no longer supports the original answer, discouraging text-only shortcuts (i.e., answering from text alone) and enforcing fine-grained visual reliance. Across eight benchmarks, BiPS boosts Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 8.2% on average and shows strong out-of-domain generalization to unseen datasets and image types.", "AI": {"tldr": "BiPS \u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u7528\u8bc1\u636e\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u8bc1\u636e\u62b9\u9664\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u65bd\u52a0 KL \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e KL \u5206\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347 Qwen2.5-VL-7B \u7ea6 8.2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 VLM \u5728\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u65f6\uff0c\u4ecd\u5ffd\u89c6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u8868\u4e2d\u7684\u6298\u7ebf\uff09\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5851\u9020\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u6587\u672c\u6377\u5f84\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u63a8\u7406\u671f\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "BiPS \u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6784\u9020\u4e24\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u89c6\u56fe\uff1a1) \u8bc1\u636e\u4fdd\u7559\u89c6\u56fe\uff1a\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u95ee\u9898\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u539f\u56fe\u548c\u8be5\u89c6\u56fe\u65bd\u52a0 KL \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u652f\u6301\u50cf\u7d20\uff08\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff09\uff1b2) \u8bc1\u636e\u62b9\u9664\u89c6\u56fe\uff1a\u906e\u76d6\u5173\u952e\u50cf\u7d20\u4f7f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u518d\u652f\u6301\u539f\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u539f\u56fe\u548c\u8be5\u62b9\u9664\u89c6\u56fe\u65bd\u52a0 KL \u5206\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u8d70\u6587\u672c\u6377\u5f84\u5e76\u5f3a\u5316\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8fd9\u4e24\u9879\u7ea6\u675f\u5171\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4f1a\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u989d\u5916\u6210\u672c\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u201c\u770b\u201d\u3002", "result": "BiPS \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u5851\u9020\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u4fdd\u7559\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0e\u62b9\u9664\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u65bd\u52a0 KL \u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e KL \u5206\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u652f\u6301\u50cf\u7d20\u5e76\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5bf9 Qwen2.5-VL-7B \u63d0\u5347\u5e73\u5747 8.2%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u57df\u5916\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "BiPS \u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347 VLM \u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u63a9\u6a21\u89c6\u56fe\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6587\u672c\u6377\u5f84\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0e\u57df\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
