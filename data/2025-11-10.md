### [1] [IndicVisionBench: Benchmarking Cultural and Multilingual Understanding in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04727)
*Ali Faraz,Akash,Shaharukh Khan,Raja Kolla,Akshat Patidar,Suranjan Goswami,Abhinav Ravi,Chandra Khatri,Shubham Agarwal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndicVisionBench evaluates VLMs in Indian multilingual and cultural contexts (OCR, MMT, VQA) with ~5K images, 37K+ QA pairs, parallel annotations; finds substantial performance gaps across 8 models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill Western-centric bias in VLM evaluation by creating a culturally-grounded, multilingual benchmark focused on the Indian subcontinent to measure and reveal limitations of existing models.

Method: Assembled dataset covering 11 languages, 3 tasks (OCR, MMT, VQA) and 6 question types; created parallel annotations across 10 Indic languages; evaluated 8 diverse VLMs (closed-source and open models) on benchmark metrics.

Result: Introduces IndicVisionBench, a large-scale benchmark for Indian subcontinent covering English +10 Indic languages, tasks OCR/MMT/VQA, ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs, 13 topics, parallel corpus across 10 languages, evaluates 8 models showing major gaps.

Conclusion: Current VLMs perform poorly on culturally diverse, multilingual Indian data; IndicVisionBench provides resources and reproducible framework to drive more inclusive multimodal research.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于角度梯度特征和Isolation Forest的两阶段异常检测方法，能高效识别合成乳腺影像中的网络引入形状伪影，定量和主观评估均表明其有效性，有助于提升合成数据质量控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在缓解数据不足方面有潜力，但未经质量评估的合成图像可能包含伪影和不现实特征，影响下游模型性能和临床实用性，因此需要专门方法检测网络引入的形状伪影。

Method: 方法包括两阶段框架：1) 构建特征提取器，通过分析每幅图像解剖边界处角度梯度的分布来构建特殊特征空间；2) 基于Isolation Forest的异常检测器，在该特征空间中识别异常样本。

Result: 在两个来自CSAW-M和VinDr-Mammo训练模型生成的合成乳腺摄影数据集中，算法在最异常分区（前1百分位）实现了高浓缩率，AUC分别为0.97和0.91；读者研究显示算法与三位影像科学家的标注一致性较好（最异常分区平均一致率66%和68%），Kendall-Tau相关分别为0.45和0.43。

Conclusion: 本文提出一种基于知识的异常检测方法，可有效检测合成乳腺影像中由生成网络引入的形状伪影，从而为合成数据的可靠使用提供质量保障。

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPO trains preference over control signals instead of images, reducing confounding and variance, yielding better controllability and efficiency than DPO/ControlNet++


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve controllability in text-to-image generation by preference learning over control conditions to avoid confounders and reduce variance

Method: Analyze methods and propose improvements

Result: CPO outperforms DPO and ControlNet++ across multiple controls with lower variance and computation/storage needs

Conclusion: Condition Preference Optimization is a practical, lower-variance alternative to image-based preference fine-tuning, improving controllability across segmentation, pose, edge, and depth controls.

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN dynamically adapts decoder regularization per-sample via TCP-predicted difficulty, adjusting dropout and channel gating, yielding strong gains in both full and efficient FM adaptation for geospatial tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of fixed regularization in decoders when adapting foundation models to heterogeneous satellite imagery tasks.

Method: Introduce Task Complexity Predictor for per-sample difficulty, Adaptive Dropout Modulation (0.1-0.5), Dynamic Capacity Gating for channel activation; theoretical links to stationary point convergence and information bottlenecks; evaluate on GeoBench, Sen1Floods11, AI4SmallFarms.

Result: DARN with TCP, ADM, and DCG improves performance: new SOTA on GeoBench (86.66% mIoU), competitive frozen-backbone results (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11), better OOD generalization (+9.5 pp), robustness (17% lower corruption error), and minority class performance.

Conclusion: DARN provides theoretical and empirical evidence that dynamic per-sample regularization improves adaptation of foundation models for satellite imagery, leading to higher accuracy, robustness, OOD performance, and minority class handling.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

TL;DR: 基于多卫星预训练—微调的深度学习框架，将2D卫星影像转为全球即时3D云属性图，首次在强热带气旋中验证出色，能填补观测空白，助力强度预报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热带气旋强度预报受限于卫星对云结构的稀缺探测与云微物理过程的难以解析；已有的3D云重建方法多在非风暴区域训练，缺乏对强烈风暴的验证。

Method: 采用对多颗具有全球覆盖的卫星数据进行预训练，再在定制的热带气旋数据集上微调；模型输入多通道2D卫星影像，输出相关云属性的3D体素/层析图，实现云场的三维重建与填补缺失观测。

Result: 首次在全球尺度上生成即时3D云图并能准确重建强烈热带气旋的三维结构，扩展了卫星观测信息并能在观测缺失时估计云场，有助于理解气旋增强过程并提升预报。

Conclusion: 提出了一个基于预训练—微调的框架，能将多源卫星2D影像翻译为3D云图，从而在全球范围内即时重建热带气旋的三维云结构，并在观测缺失时提供估计。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出可部署于微控制器的事件相机眼动追踪网络EETnet，包含网格分类与像素回归两种架构，并给出训练与量化方法，解决了现有方法对GPU依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高在资源受限嵌入式设备（如微控制器）上使用事件驱动相机进行低功耗、低延迟视线追踪的可部署性，同时减少对高性能GPU的依赖。

Method: 设计轻量级卷积网络架构，利用事件数据输入，提供分类（网格检测瞳孔）和回归（像素级定位）两种输出形式；并提出训练、评估流程和网络量化策略以适配微控制器部署。

Result: 提出EETnet，一种仅使用事件数据的卷积神经网络（含分类和回归两种变体），并给出训练、评估与量化流程，能够在微控制器上运行；基于公开数据集进行了验证。

Conclusion: EETnet在保证性能的同时能在资源受限的设备上运行，展示了事件相机眼动追踪从研究到嵌入式部署的可行路径。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

### [7] [3D Gaussian Point Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04797)
*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出3D高斯点编码器，用学习的3D高斯混合做显式点嵌入，通过自然梯度和从PointNet蒸馏优化，速度、内存和FLOPs均优于PointNet，并能在CPU上高帧率运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Introduce an explicit per-point embedding for 3D recognition using mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians as a departure from implicit representations like PointNet.

Method: Use mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians as per-point embeddings; optimize using natural gradients and distillation from PointNets to learn Gaussian Basis; apply computational geometry heuristics and filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian Splatting to accelerate; evaluate on benchmarks and integrate into Mamba3D.

Result: Developed optimization techniques (natural gradients, distillation from PointNets) to learn a Gaussian Basis reconstructing PointNet activations; created 3D Gaussian Point Encoders that are faster and more parameter/memory/FLOP efficient; extended filtering techniques to further speedup; integrated into Mamba3D achieving additional efficiency; capable of high CPU-only framerates.

Conclusion: 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are an effective, efficient explicit geometric representation for 3D recognition, offering substantial speed and resource advantages over PointNets and integrating well into larger systems like Mamba3D.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [8] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dataset quantization finds only ~10% of data needed for comparable performance; DQ-selected patches are more diverse; cross-domain finetuning causes forgetting but selective replay of 5-10% source data mitigates it; ordering domains helps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce annotation cost by identifying redundancy in training data and to understand/mitigate catastrophic forgetting when adapting generalist segmentation models across domains.

Method: Proposed dataset quantization to select diverse patches using latent MAE embeddings and t-SNE; empirical experiments on Cyto dataset measuring performance vs subset size; cross-domain finetuning experiments with replay strategies and domain sequencing studies.

Result: This paper studies data redundancy and catastrophic forgetting in generalist biomedical image segmentation using Cellpose. It proposes dataset quantization (DQ) to select compact diverse subsets; shows 10% data suffices; uses MAE embeddings+t-SNE for diversity analysis. Cross-domain finetuning causes forgetting; selective DQ replay (5-10%) restores source performance while full replay can hurt target. Training domain sequencing improves generalization.

Conclusion: Efficient biomedical segmentation can be achieved via compact, diversity-aware training subsets and retention-aware transfer strategies (selective replay, sequence-aware training) to avoid catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [9] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 结合主动学习与伪标签，由大模型生成初始标注供nnU-Net自配置，再用代表性样本少量人工标注微调，显著减少标注需求并保持竞争性分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce manual annotation while enabling nnU-Net to work when only raw images available and leverage foundation models' zero-shot capabilities but counter their dataset-specific shortcomings

Method: Active learning + pseudo-labeling + nnU-Net

Result: Pipeline generates pseudo-labels from foundation model, uses them for nnU-Net configuration, selects a core-set for minimal manual annotation, fine-tunes nnU-Net, achieving competitive segmentation with fewer manual labels

Conclusion: 提出的数据中心工作流有效融合大模型与nnU-Net，减少人工注释并保持性能，便于生物医学研究者应用先进分割技术。

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

### [10] [Geometry Denoising with Preferred Normal Vectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04848)
*Manuel Weiß,Lukas Baumgärtner,Roland Herzog,Stephan Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes denoising method that segments mesh faces by nearest normal-label and regularizes via total variation, solved by split Bregman/ADMM with second-order vertex updates


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Use prior knowledge of preferred normal directions to guide denoising and segmentation, improving preservation of features and normals

Method: Label-aware geometry denoising via ADMM with TV regularization

Result: Formulated an energy combining fidelity to desired normals (labels), TV regularization, and derived ADMM/split Bregman solver; vertex update using second-order shape calculus

Conclusion: Label vectors enable integrated segmentation–denoising; ADMM with shape-calculus vertex updates effectively minimizes the proposed energy

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督的隐式自先验方法，从单个点云中学习形状特定先验并嵌入到隐式距离场，通过字典+cross-attention捕捉重复结构，训练后采样生成密集点和法线并用RIMLS重建，兼顾细节保留和稀疏区正则化，优于传统与学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云到高质量表面重建是病态问题，传统方法或需强先验或外部训练数据；提出从单个输入点云中直接提取形状特定先验，以同时保留细节并正则化稀疏区域。

Method: 联合训练一个小型可学习嵌入字典和隐式距离场；在每个查询点通过cross-attention让场访问字典，从点云自监督重建损失学习；训练后用自动微分从场中采样出密集点和解析法线；将这些点和法线输入RIMLS进行最终表面重建。

Result: 在定量和定性实验中，该方法能更好地保持细节并对常见噪声/稀疏性更鲁棒，性能优于现有经典和学习型基线。

Conclusion: 该方法在无需外部数据的情况下，通过在隐式场中引入可学习字典并结合RIMLS，实现了高保真表面重建，在细节保留和对降质数据的鲁棒性上超过现有经典与学习方法。

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Clinical-ComBAT：逐站点、支持非线性与小样本的DW-MRI站点归一化方法，适用于现实临床多中心数据融合，验证显示比传统ComBAT更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ComBAT假设线性协变量关系、均质群体、固定且充足样本的站点，限制了其在真实临床多中心数据整合中的可用性。

Method: 引入逐站点独立的归一化框架：使用非线性多项式数据模型、以规范站点为参考的站点特异性校正、针对小队列的方差先验、超参数调优及拟合优度评估。

Result: 在模拟数据和真实临床数据上，Clinical-ComBAT改善了扩散度量的一致性，增强了对规范建模的适用性并在小样本或新增站点情况下表现稳定。

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT能在临床环境中更灵活可靠地对DW-MRI扩散标量图进行站点间归一化，克服了原始ComBAT方法在非线性关系、小样本站点和新增站点场景下的限制。

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于耳鼻喉科专科医生约有27%的误诊率，提高耳病诊断准确性具有重要临床意义，探究Vision Transformer（尤其是Swin）在耳病诊断中的效果并与CNN比较。

Method: 使用来自智利大学临床医院耳鼻喉科的真实耳镜视频数据集；基于Laplacian和Shannon熵阈值选择帧并去除空白帧；训练Swin v1、Swin v2和ResNet模型；最初未检测出数据泄漏导致准确率过高，修正后重新评估得到较低的性能。

Result: 初始结果显示Swin v1达到100%、Swin v2为99.1%、ResNet为99.5%；发现并修正数据泄漏后，准确率分别降为83%、83%、82%；强调数据处理中的泄漏会严重夸大模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究结论是：在纠正数据泄漏后，Swin v1和Swin v2的准确率均降至83%，ResNet为82%，表明视觉transformer虽有潜力但并未显著优于传统CNN，数据预处理质量对结果影响巨大。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

*Ahmad Elallaf,Nathan Jacobs,Xinyue Ye,Mei Chen,Gongbo Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出一种基于卫星影像的地理空间深度学习方法，输出Beta风险分布以表达不确定性，在召回和校准上显著优于点估计基线，有利于提升道路安全决策的可置信性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究多孤立地分析风险因素，忽视了复杂的空间和环境交互；同时常规神经网络仅输出点估计，未表达模型不确定性，影响在关键决策中的信任与安全性。

Method: 使用卫星影像作为输入，训练深度神经网络输出Beta分布参数（α, β），从而对每个地理单元的致命车祸风险进行概率分布估计，并通过适当的损失函数（如基于对数似然或分布距离）实现分布拟合与校准。评价指标包括召回率和校准度，与常见基线方法（点估计神经网络等）进行对比。

Result: 模型在召回率上提升17-23%，且校准性能更好，能够仅基于卫星影像提供可靠且可解释的风险评估，有助于自动驾驶与城市规划。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了利用卫星影像的地理空间深度学习框架，通过对致命事故风险估计提供整个Beta分布来量化不确定性，以增强在安全关键应用中的可置信度。

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IMDNet通过解耦退化成分并动态选择恢复路径，实现对同时存在多种退化（雨、噪声、雾等）图像的自适应恢复，性能优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多针对单一退化类型，真实场景常同时存在多种退化，需能识别并针对混合退化自适应选择恢复策略以提升实际效果。

Method: 在编码器中设计DIDBlock结合空间和频域统计分离退化成分；使用FBlock的可学习矩阵跨层融合多尺度退化信息；在解码器中设计TABlock基于退化表示动态激活与融合功能分支以选择最优恢复路径。

Result: 提出了一种用于多重退化的图像恢复网络IMDNet，通过在编码器中使用降解成分解耦块（DIDBlock）将空间和频域信息结合以分离不同退化成分，在各层使用可学习矩阵的融合块（FBlock）整合信息，并在解码器中用任务自适应块（TABlock）根据解耦表示动态激活/融合功能分支，从而选择最优恢复路径。实验显示在多退化恢复上优于现有方法，同时在单一退化任务上也有竞争力。

Conclusion: DIDBlock能够有效分离退化成分并生成独立表示，FBlock实现多层退化信息融合，TABlock根据表示动态选择或融合分支，实现灵活路径选择。整体架构在多退化场景下恢复效果显著，且对单一退化场景保持竞争力。

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual
records, including diagnoses, treatment plans, and follow-up notes. The data
were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future

TL;DR: 在高维潜在空间中用可学习水印嵌入器和MAARL对抗训练，实现对抗鲁棒性与篡改敏感性的平衡，提高对深度伪造的检测性能，CelebA上提升>4.5%，CelebA-HQ上提升>5.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 被动检测依赖特征难以泛化；主动水印能显著提高对高质量合成媒体的识别，但现有水印方法在鲁棒性与敏感性间存在权衡问题，需新的学习范式来实现自适应平衡。

Method: 在高维潜在空间设计可学习嵌入器与提取器，使用MAARL框架训练三个主体（嵌入器、提取器、攻击者），攻击者按课程生成良性与恶意变换，奖励设计促使嵌入器在鲁棒性与脆弱性间达成权衡。

Result: A novel latent-space, learnable watermarking method trained via Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (MAARL) to balance robustness and fragility for deepfake detection; outperforms SOTA on CelebA/CelebA-HQ under manipulations.

Conclusion: 所提方法在潜在空间嵌入可学习水印，并通过MAARL与动态课程的攻击者交互，能在复杂篡改场景下提高检测准确性和泛化能力，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CLM系统，通过将Gaussians在CPU与GPU之间按需调度并利用访问模式进行流水线重叠与通信压缩，使得3D Gaussian Splatting在单张消费级GPU上渲染包含1亿个Gaussian的大场景成为可能，同时保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D Gaussian Splatting内存需求随场景放大急剧增长，超出常规GPU容量，限制大场景应用；因此需要一种在单张消费级GPU上渲染大规模Gaussian场景的系统解决方案。

Method: CLM关键在于将Gaussians离载至CPU内存并按需迁移到GPU，同时基于对3DGS内存访问模式的观察，设计了流水线调度以重叠GPU<->CPU通信、GPU计算与CPU计算，并进一步通过访问模式减少通信数据量。

Result: CLM

Conclusion: CLM有效扩展了3DGS到大规模场景：通过基于访问模式的离载策略与流水线并行，降低通信与内存压力，在RTX4090上可渲染100M Gaussian场景并保持SOTA重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PDS，一种用于fMRI与dMRI互补的模式感知双模态三维扩散生成框架，并引入组织精修网络与微观结构精修以提升结构和细节保真度。方法在OASIS-3、ADNI与内部数据集上表现优于基线，fMRI与dMRI合成在PSNR/SSIM上分别提升约1–4%。临床验证中合成数据在NC/MCI/AD分类任务中达到约64–68%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAN与扩散模型在fMRI-dMRI合成上受限，主要原因是两模态在时间/梯度维度信号差异大以及生成过程中未充分融合与疾病相关的解剖模式，因此需新方法提升合成质量与临床可用性。

Method: 提出了两大创新：1) 模式感知的双模态3D扩散学习框架，用于跨时间/梯度轴捕捉fMRI与dMRI之间的差异；2) 结合微观结构精修的组织精修网络，用以维持解剖结构忠实度与细节恢复。

Result: 在OASIS-3、ADNI与内部数据集上，fMRI合成PSNR/SSIM为29.83 dB/90.84%（较基线提升+1.54 dB/+4.12%），dMRI合成30.00 dB/77.55%（提升+1.02 dB/+2.2%）；临床分类（NC/MCI/AD）准确率为67.92%/66.02%/64.15%。

Conclusion: PDS能有效合成缺失的fMRI或dMRI，既改善了图像质量（PSNR/SSIM显著提升），又在混合真实-合成数据的临床分类任务中保持可用性，显示出在神经退行性疾病研究中填补模态缺失的潜力。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

TL;DR: 提出一个端到端可微分框架，用傅里叶级数参数化任意形状，利用绕数映射把形状转到像素网格，并通过信号能量约束提升优化效率和物理可行性，从而证明形状本身可驱动DNN分类、解释和对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者想探究深度神经网络(DNN)对形状（几何）信息的理解和利用，弥补现有研究主要关注纹理而忽视几何方面的空白。

Method: 构建端到端可微分系统：用强大的傅里叶级数参数化任意形状，采用绕数（winding number）映射将连续形状转换为像素化输入，加入信号能量约束以提高优化效率并保证形状物理合理性，进而用梯度优化生成能驱动模型决策的形状。

Result: 展示通过优化形状即可作为强有力的语义载体：仅由几何构成的输入能被模型高置信度分类；形状是高保真可解释性工具，可精确定位模型的显著区域；并构成一种可泛化的新对抗范式，能够欺骗下游视觉任务。

Conclusion: 几何形状是理解和挑战DNN感知能力的关键工具；该框架为研究模型对几何信息的感知、可解释性分析以及对抗攻击提供了新方法。

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

Method: Repulsive Surface生成标注3D数据并训练拓扑估计器

Result: 使用Repulsive Surface算法生成可控拓扑不变量（如流形的genus）和多样几何形状的合成3D点云/表面数据集；基于3D卷积变换器训练genus估计网络并展示性能随变形增加下降，指出几何复杂度影响泛化性。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了带拓扑标注的3D数据集空白，有助于训练与评估基于神经网络的TDA方法；未来工作应增强几何多样性和鲁棒性，改进模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

TL;DR: 提出首个贴纸语义相似性基准Triple-S（905对标注）和通用贴纸编码器GSE，弥补现有模型在贴纸语义理解上的不足，GSE在多个任务上表现优越并已公开发布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贴纸作为流行视觉交流形式，内容高度多样且符号化，现有模型难以捕捉其细粒度语义关系，因此需要专门基准与模型来评估与提升贴纸语义理解能力。

Method: 定义任务并收集905对人工标注的正负贴纸对作为Triple-S；评估现有预训练视觉与多模态模型的表现；提出GSE框架，使用Triple-S与其他数据联合训练以学习稳健贴纸嵌入；在检索与情感分类等下游任务上进行评测。

Result: Triple-S包含905个人工标注贴纸对，实验证明现有预训练模型在该任务上表现不佳；GSE在Triple-S以及下游情感分类和贴纸检索任务上显著提升效果，对未见贴纸也有良好泛化。

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are
available here.

TL;DR: 本文发现当前大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）偏向文本模态，原因是简单将视觉嵌入拼接到文本序列。作者提出用平均池化视觉特征来精炼文本嵌入，从而改善视觉对齐并显著减少幻觉。方法简单高效，未来可探索更复杂的融合策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLM因把视觉嵌入直接拼接到文本序列，导致模型过度依赖语言而忽视视觉，带来视觉理解不足和幻觉问题。作者希望通过增强文本表示的视觉感知来平衡两种模态影响。

Method: 对视觉特征做平均池化，得到全局视觉向量，并将其整合进文本嵌入（即在文本表示中注入视觉信息），以改善跨模态对齐，而非简单将视觉嵌入作为追加序列。

Result: 在标准基准上，注入平均池化视觉特征的策略显著提高了视觉定位能力并大幅减少了幻觉率，且实现简单、计算高效。

Conclusion: 通过将平均池化的视觉信息注入文本嵌入，能够有效减轻模态不平衡，显著提升视觉定位能力并减少模型在视觉问答中的幻觉现象。

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

TL;DR: 为解决WSI端到端训练中切片数量庞大导致的计算瓶颈，提出基于记忆库的动态残差编码与滑动级对比学习（DRE-SLCL），通过结合在线采样与记忆检索的切片特征构建WSI表示，提升下游病理任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端训练受限于WSI超大尺寸（上万切片），GPU无法在单个mini-batch中处理所有切片，需设计高效表示学习方法。

Method: 使用记忆库缓存全数据集切片特征；每个mini-batch对每张WSI随机采样部分切片并编码，再从记忆库检索额外切片特征；采用残差编码将采样与检索的特征融合为WSI表示；基于WSI表示与病理报告进行滑动级对比损失训练。

Result: 在癌症亚型分类、癌症识别和突变预测任务上，DRE-SLCL在实验中表现优于基线，验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出DRE-SLCL用于端到端WSI表征，通过记忆库和残差编码缓解GPU计算限制，实现滑动级对比学习并提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出NTP-MRISeg，将医学指引图像分割重构为统一多模态序列（图像-文本-掩码）的自回归下一个token预测任务，简化设计并支持端到端训练。引入Next-k Token Prediction减少累积误差，Token-level Contrastive Learning增强边界敏感性，Hard Error Token强调困难token。实验证明在两个数据集上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MRIS方法依赖复杂的多模态融合或多阶段解码器，设计繁琐且与外部分割模型耦合。作者希望通过统一自回归token预测的方式简化架构并利用多模态预训练资源，同时解决该新范式带来的暴露偏差、长尾分布和精细边界分割挑战。

Method: 将图像、文本与掩码token化为统一序列，使用自回归模型进行下一个token预测；引入Next-k Token Prediction (预测k个token减少累积误差)、Token-level Contrastive Learning (提高边界敏感性并缓解长尾分布)和Hard Error Token记忆优化 (优先学习困难token)。可利用大规模多模态预训练tokenizer和端到端训练。

Result: 在QaTa-COV19和MosMedData+数据集上，NTP-MRISeg取得新的SOTA性能，展示了该统一自回归方法在准确性和泛化性上的优势。

Conclusion: NTP-MRISeg通过将MRIS任务转为统一的自回归多模态token预测，省去了复杂的跨模态融合与外部分割模块，并用NkTP、TCL和HET三种策略解决暴露偏差、长尾token与边界精细度问题，从而在QaTa-COV19和MosMedData+上获得了新的最优结果，证明该方法是简洁且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

*Mingyu Sung,Hyeonmin Choe,Il-Min Kim,Sangseok Yun,Jae Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PITTA，一种用于单目深度估计的测试时域自适应（TTA）框架，无需相机位姿信息，结合实例感知遮罩和边缘提取来处理动态场景，显著提升在不同环境下的深度估计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督测试时自适应方法在多变动态环境中效果欠佳，尤其依赖相机位姿或难以处理动态物体，亟需一种在无位姿信息和动态场景下仍能稳定工作的TTA方法。

Method: 提出两大关键策略：1) 位姿无关的TTA范式，允许在不使用相机位姿信息的情况下对预训练MDE网络进行自适应；2) 实例感知图像遮罩，从预训练的全景分割结果中提取动态物体的实例级遮罩并去除静态背景。另辅以简单有效的图像和深度边缘提取用于损失或正则化。

Result: 在DrivingStereo与Waymo上进行大量实验，PITTA在各种环境条件下显著优于现有SOTA方法，表现出更强的鲁棒性和适应能力。

Conclusion: PITTA在无需相机位姿的条件下，通过实例级动态物体遮罩和图像/深度边缘提取，显著提升了测试时自适应的单目深度估计性能，在DrivingStereo和Waymo数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过多角色视角的MLLM生成语义多样的caption，Role-SynthCLIP在更少合成样本下实现更好的CLIP检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据方法侧重扩大量而忽视语义多样性，导致caption重复、浅显。提升语义多样性和细粒度对齐可提高CLIP表现且减少所需样本量。

Method: 构建多视角角色扮演提示（如组合分析师、图像上下文解释者等），利用MLLM对每张图像生成多样化、富信息的描述性caption，形成高质量合成数据用于CLIP预训练。

Result: 在仅1M Role-SynthCLIP合成对上训练的CLIP-B/16在MS COCO val上Recall@1达到64.1%，比最优合成数据基线（5M对）高2.8个百分点，证明了方法的有效性与高效性。

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP通过多视角角色扮演提示指导多模态大模型生成语义多样且细粒度对齐的合成图文对，从而在保持样本数量不变下提升CLIP训练效果。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

TL;DR: SurgiATM通过统计桥接物理模型与深度学习，作为轻量即插模块在不增加可训练参数的前提下提高外科去烟方法的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术中电凝等导致的烟雾严重影响内镜可视性与计算机辅助分析，现有方法在泛化性或准确性上各有不足，故需一种兼顾物理可靠性与数据驱动精度的轻量级可移植模块以满足临床需求。

Method: 提出基于统计形式的外科大气模型（SurgiATM），将物理成像大气模型参数化并与已有深度网络输出结合进行图像复原；模块仅含两个超参数，无新增训练参数，可作为前/后处理单元集成到多种网络。

Result: 提出SurgiATM，一个将物理大气传输模型与数据驱动深度学习结合的轻量级外科烟雾去除模块，作为即插即用组件无新增可训练权重，仅引入两个超参数，能提升多种去烟网络在不同手术数据集上的恢复精度和泛化性。

Conclusion: 在三个公开外科数据集和十种去烟方法上验证，SurgiATM普遍降低重建误差并增强模型泛化性，且实现方法简单、计算开销小、便于临床部署。

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at
https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

TL;DR: 本文通过遮挡（sliding mask）实验发现图像对抗样本在遮挡下置信度波动明显大于原样本，提出SMCE指标量化该波动并设计SWM-AED检测方法，在CIFAR-10上对多种攻击表现鲁棒，准确率多数情况>62%且最高达96.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻找能区分对抗样本与原始样本的内在差异，以提升DNN对抗鲁棒性与检测能力，避免依赖对抗训练导致的过拟合问题。

Method: 构建滑动遮罩机制对输入图像进行局部遮挡，记录模型在每个位置的预测置信度并计算熵，得到Mask Entropy Field Map与统计分布，以此定义Sliding Mask Confidence Entropy（SMCE）；基于SMCE阈值设计滑动窗口遮罩对抗样本检测器（SWM-AED）。评估使用9种常见攻击在CIFAR-10上生成对抗样本并与原样本比较。

Result: 在超过1800张测试图像和9种攻击上，SMCE显示对抗样本在遮挡下置信度波动显著更大；SWM-AED在多数实验配置下检测准确率超过62%，在最佳情况下达96.5%。

Conclusion: 实验表明基于滑动遮罩的置信度熵（SMCE）能有效区分对抗样本与原样本；所提SWM-AED方法在CIFAR-10上对多种攻击和分类器具有稳健的检测能力且避免了常规对抗训练的灾难性过拟合。

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决虚拟数据在构建复杂和领域泛化差的问题，为行人重识别(Re-ID)提供隐私保护的可用训练数据。

Method: 第一阶段：设计多维属性提示（外观、光照、视角）驱动扩散模型端到端合成数据，构建GenePerson数据集。第二阶段：提出PDM，使用两个文本反演网络将图像映射为代表风格与内容的伪词，通过对比学习构建风格解耦的内容提示，指导模型在图像级学习领域不变内容特征。

Result: 提出Dual-stage Prompt-driven Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP)，构建大型合成数据集GenePerson（130,519张，6,641人）并设计Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM)利用文本反演与对比学习实现风格-内容解耦，提高领域不变特征学习。

Conclusion: 在合成数据GenePerson与PDM的联合作用下，训练的模型在跨域Re-ID任务上取得了领先性能，表明基于扩散模型的提示工程和解耦机制是构建隐私友好且高泛化性数据集的有效路径。

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

Motivation: 提高模型在真实恶劣天气下的泛化能力，克服仅在固定合成数据上训练导致对复杂退化失效的问题。

Method: 1) 构建HFLS-Weather物理驱动高保真合成数据集；2) 设计双层RL框架：局部级通过扰动驱动的图像质量优化对特定天气模型进行奖励式微调；全局级由元控制器动态选择并调度模型执行顺序；3) 以HFLS-Weather初始化进行冷启动训练并在真实数据上持续自适应。

Result: 构建了高保真物理驱动的数据集HFLS-Weather，并提出双层强化学习框架（局部扰动驱动的无监督图像质量优化与全局元控制器的模型选择），实现在真实天气下的持续自适应并在多种恶劣天气情景下达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 结合高保真物理仿真数据与双层强化学习可以实现无配对监督下的持续在线适应，显著改善模型在多种真实天气条件下的表现。

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 作者首次直接用深度学习对原始OCT B扫描图像进行阿尔茨海默病（AD）早期预测，在UK Biobank受控匹配数据集上微调多种预训练模型并采用OCT特异性增强和按年加权损失；ResNet-34在4年窗口内AUC=0.62，低于临床可用阈值，但可解释性分析显示中央黄斑区有差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已有研究多基于分层厚度测量发现视网膜变化与AD相关，但这些传统指标可能遗漏原始图像中细微结构信息；本研究尝试直接从原始OCT B扫描中挖掘更早期的AD影像信号，以期在临床确诊前实现早期预测。

Method: 在UK Biobank匹配的受试者层交叉验证数据集上，微调多种预训练网络（包括ImageNet模型和OCT专用的RETFound transformer）；为防止小样本高维过拟合，使用常规与OCT特异性数据增强，并采用按年加权损失函数更重视在成像后四年内确诊的病例；模型以B扫描为输入进行分类，最终以受试者级别评估AUC。

Result: ResNet-34表现最稳定，在4年窗队列中达到AUC=0.62，低于临床可用标准；可解释性分析定位到中央黄斑区的局部结构差异，强调需要更大数据集与多模态方法来提升预测能力。

Conclusion: 研究建立了基于原始OCT B扫描的AD预测基线，结果表明在影像发生至临床确诊前数年检测AD的视觉生物标志微弱且难以利用当前小样本深度学习模型稳定识别，需更大样本和多模态融合以提高性能。

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Motivation: Lane markings often absent/occluded in snow; use roadside posts as indirect indicators to enable robust lane detection in winter

Method: Detect roadside delineators and fit Bezier lanes

Result: Perceives delineators, fits smooth lane trajectory with parameterized Bezier curves; achieves significantly improved robustness vs SOTA in heavy snow; real-time capable

Conclusion: Approach provides reliable lane detection in winter by bypassing lane markings, supported by new synthetic dataset enabling future research

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 通过将高斯表示与变形场分为前景/背景并分别训练，本文在稀疏摄像机条件下显著提升了可变高斯投影的动态3D重建效果，模型更小、PSNR更高且能输出动态分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在稀疏多摄像机设置下，现有可变高斯投影方法在捕捉复杂动态场景时性能不佳的问题，尤其在电影制作受限拍摄预算时常见。

Method: 使用少量t=0帧掩码将表征分为前景与背景；在canonical预训练阶段对两部分采用不同损失训练；在动态训练阶段分别对两个变形场建模（前景学习颜色、位置、旋转等多样动态；背景仅学习点位置变化），并遵循电影制作中的参数分配实践。

Result: 提出将标准的高斯和变形场分解为前景和背景两部分，使用少量t=0帧的掩码进行分割，并在各自阶段采用不同的训练损失和参数建模，从而在稀疏视角下获得更好的动态重建质量，实验在3D和2.5D数据集上表现出比SotA更高的PSNR并减小模型尺寸，同时能在无需密集掩码监督下生成带透明/动态纹理的分割重建。

Conclusion: 方法有效缓解稀疏多视角下的动态重建问题，提供更紧凑的模型和更好的视觉质量，同时实现了无需密集掩码监督的动态分割能力。

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

Motivation: Transformer计算复杂度随输入分辨率平方增长，DINOv3等大模型需要高分辨率输入以产出细粒度特征，导致高计算与内存开销。作者希望在保持特征质量和下游性能的前提下降低计算成本。

Method: 在DINOv3教师模型生成的高分辨率特征图上进行自监督知识蒸馏，训练学生模型复现这些高分辨率特征；学生在推理时使用较低输入分辨率或更轻量的计算，仍能输出与教师相似的密集特征图。

Result: BRIXEL在固定分辨率下在多个下游任务上显著优于DINOv3基线，并能在计算成本大幅降低的情况下生成与教师相似的特征图。模型与代码开源。

Conclusion: 该论文提出BRIXEL，通过知识蒸馏让学生网络在低分辨率下重建教师网络在高分辨率上的细粒度特征图，从而在计算与内存成本大幅降低的同时保持或提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code

*Zijiang Yang,Hanqing Chao,Bokai Zhao,Yelin Yang,Yunshuo Zhang,Dongmei Fu,Junping Zhang,Le Lu,Ke Yan,Dakai Jin,Minfeng Xu,Yun Bian,Hui Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MUSE（含NuLo），通过坐标引导的局部自蒸馏实现跨尺度对齐，充分利用无标签病理图像，提升核检测与分类性能，超过现有监督基线与通用病理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NDC方法依赖人工核级标注且难以利用大量无标签数据；需一种能在无须严格像素对齐的情况下学习细粒度核表征的自监督方法。

Method: 核心为NuLo（基于预测核位置的局部自蒸馏），配合多尺度自蒸馏策略、简单的编码器-解码器和大视野半监督微调；去除了严格视图对齐需求，支持跨尺度信息融合。

Result: MUSE introduces NuLo for flexible local self-distillation using predicted nucleus positions, enabling cross-scale alignment without strict spatial alignment; employs encoder-decoder and large FOV semi-supervised fine-tuning; outperforms SOTA supervised and foundation models on benchmarks.

Conclusion: MUSE通过NuLo及配套架构与大视野半监督微调，有效提升核的细粒度表征学习，显著提高NDC任务性能，适合在大规模无标签病理图像上部署。

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

*André Peter Kelm,Max Braeschke,Emre Gülsoylu,Simone Frintrop*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WtL2把轮廓跟踪扩展到红外与多类RGB对象，替代NMS以生成一像素闭合轮廓并二值化为高细节分割，适用于需要高质量分割的专业任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原WtL仅针对彩色图像中的船只进行细致分割，限制了适用范围；目标是扩展到红外影像以及更多RGB物体，提供替代NMS的高精细分割方式以获取高质量样本。

Method: 保持原WtL的轮廓跟踪核心，改造输入的轮廓检测器以适配红外船只，并增强算法以处理多种RGB对象；通过跟踪并细化检测到的轮廓直到形成1像素宽的闭合曲线，然后二值化为前景。

Result: 在能成功闭合轮廓的情况下，WtL2在细节保持和峰值IoU上优于最新一代基于轮廓的方法，能为专业应用生成高质量分割结果。

Conclusion: WtL2是一种将轮廓跟踪用于替代常规NMS，以生成一像素闭合曲线并二值化为前背景分割区域的方法，扩展了原WtL到红外和多类RGB对象，在能闭合轮廓时表现出高IoU与细节保持，适合需要高质量细致分割的专业场景。

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeControl通过单步注意力提取和LCD无训练地提供高效且稳健的语义结构控制，支持多图组合，兼容现代扩散模型，额外开销约5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ControlNet）依赖手工条件图与再训练，通用性差；反演方法虽对齐更好但推理代价高。目标是在不训练或反演的前提下，实现高效、稳定且可组合的结构与语义控制。

Method: 从单一最优关键时间步进行一次性注意力提取并在整个去噪过程中复用；引入LCD将关键时间步与用于注意力提取的噪声潜变量分离；允许从多来源参考图像组装实现组合式控制。

Result: 实现训练自由的结构化控制，显著降低推理成本（约5%额外开销），消除结构伪影，提高视觉一致性和提示对齐性，并支持直观的场景布局设计与参考图像组合。

Conclusion: FreeControl在无需训练的情况下实现了高效的语义结构控制，通过一次性注意力提取和Latent-Condition Decoupling（LCD）提升质量与稳定性，支持组合式参考图像输入，兼容现代扩散模型，额外开销约5%。

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

*Mengqi Guo,Bo Xu,Yanyan Li,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D3R performs pose-free dynamic neural rendering by combining 3D foundational models for initialization, a motion-aware bundle adjustment using transformer priors and SAM2 for segmentation, and an efficient motion-aware Gaussian Splatting with control points and linear blend skinning to model dynamics, yielding better quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes from monocular videos without known camera poses and reduce reliance on precomputed poses and expensive dynamic representations

Method: Two-stage pose-free dynamic neural rendering

Result: Up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement and 5x computational cost reduction compared to prior methods

Conclusion: 4D3R effectively decouples static and dynamic components, refines poses and geometry with motion-aware techniques, and models dynamic motion efficiently, improving reconstruction accuracy and reducing compute.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

TL;DR: 本文提出为工业异常检测预训练专门表征，通过在大型AD数据集RealIAD上预训练并引入角度与模长导向的对比损失，促使正常与异常特征在角度和模长上更可分，从而提升下游嵌入式AD方法性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ImageNet预训练的特征与AD任务目标不匹配且存在域差异，导致在工业异常检测上表现欠佳，因此需要为AD任务专门设计的预训练表征。

Method: 在RealIAD数据集上进行预训练，使用残差特征作为类通用表示，并设计角度导向与模长导向的对比损失，分别最大化正常与异常特征间的角度差异与模长差异；预训练完成后替换现有嵌入式AD方法的特征进行评估。

Result: 在五个AD数据集上，基于五种嵌入式AD方法的实验均显示使用作者预训练特征后性能提升，验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: 在五个AD数据集与五个主干网络上替换原始特征为本文预训练特征，性能一致提升，表明为AD任务专门预训练的表征能显著优于ImageNet预训练特征。

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

Conclusion: SPD矩阵提供强统计表示，孪生网络学习语义相似性，组合可实现灵活连续的动力学状态检测与高精度在线识别，在多个基准数据集上取得最好或接近最好性能。

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

TL;DR: 基于裁剪体积的3D U-Net能在术中超声下快速且可靠地自动分割肝转移瘤，接近专家水平并显著减少人工和时间成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中准确定位和分割肝转移瘤对保证阴性切缘至关重要，但iUS存在低对比度、噪声高和操作依赖性强等问题，自动分割有望提高精度和效率，减少人工负担。

Method: 在85例CRLM的受跟踪3D iUS数据上使用nnU-Net框架训练3D U-Net，比较全量体积与肿瘤裁剪体积两种训练策略，指标包括DSC、HDist、RVD，并在回顾性与前瞻性数据集上评估；将工作流集成到3D Slicer以实现术中实时应用。

Result: 裁剪体积模型在所有指标上显著优于全量模型（AUC-ROC 0.898 vs 0.718），中位DSC=0.74、召回=0.79、HDist.=17.1 mm；分割速度约为半自动方法的1/4（约1分钟），前瞻性术中测试显示性能稳健并达到临床可接受水平。

Conclusion: 自动3D U-Net（裁剪体积）在iUS上对CRLM的分割性能可靠，接近专家水平，并能实现近实时、低人工干预的术中导航。

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

Abstract: The analysis of character appearance frequency is essential for understanding
narrative structure, character prominence, and story progression in anime. In
this work, we introduce OregairuChar, a benchmark dataset designed for
appearance frequency analysis in the anime series My Teen Romantic Comedy
SNAFU. The dataset comprises 1600 manually selected frames from the third

OregairuChar captures diverse visual challenges, including occlusion, pose
variation, and inter-character similarity, providing a realistic basis for
appearance-based studies. To enable quantitative research, we benchmark several
object detection models on the dataset and leverage their predictions for
fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This
approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within
the narrative. By emphasizing appearance frequency, OregairuChar serves as a
valuable resource for exploring computational narrative dynamics and
character-centric storytelling in stylized media.

Motivation: 构建具备主动调用外部工具（如代码执行、网络搜索）能力的多模态智能体，实现将工具调用融入其推理流程，提高实用任务表现。

Method: 数据集包含需工具使用的多样中等难度样例；首先冷启动以示范或监督方式建立工具使用行为，再用强化学习细化策略；评估通过RealX-Bench和其他基准测试工具调用适应性与任务性能。

Result: 提出DeepEyesV2，采用两阶段训练：冷启动阶段建立工具使用模式，强化学习阶段优化工具调用；构建含需工具使用样例的数据集；并引入RealX-Bench基准评测模型在真实世界多模态推理上的表现。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练结合专门构造的数据能有效引导多模态模型学会并在情境中自适应地调用工具，强化学习进一步促进复杂工具组合与基于上下文的选择。

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

Result: CuisineSense: two-stage eating detection and fine-grained classification using smartwatch and smart glasses IMU; dataset 27.5 hours, 11 categories, 10 participants; high accuracy.

Conclusion: CuisineSense为可穿戴、隐私友好且对中国饮食多样性适配的饮食监测提供了实用方案；实验验证了其在进食检测与食物分类上的高性能。

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

*Matteo Bastico,David Ryckelynck,Laurent Corté,Yannick Tillier,Etienne Decencière*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Chamfer Distance-based metrics are brittle; use alignment and Density-Aware Chamfer Distance; add Surface Normal Concordance to evaluate surface similarity; and propose Diffusion Point Transformer that achieves SOTA on ShapeNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation metrics for generated 3D point clouds (notably Chamfer Distance) are not robust and miss geometric and local shape fidelity; better metrics and stronger generative models are needed to advance realistic point cloud synthesis.

Method: Analyze failures of CD; introduce sample alignment prior to distance computation; adopt Density-Aware Chamfer Distance; define Surface Normal Concordance by estimating per-point normals and comparing them; design a transformer-based diffusion generative model using serialized patch attention for point clouds; evaluate on ShapeNet with quantitative and qualitative metrics.

Result: This paper critiques common point cloud evaluation metrics (esp. Chamfer Distance), proposes improvements (alignment before distance computation, Density-Aware Chamfer Distance), introduces a new metric Surface Normal Concordance (SNC) based on normals, and proposes a new generative architecture Diffusion Point Transformer leveraging serialized patch attention; experiments on ShapeNet show SOTA and code released.

Conclusion: Replace naive CD with aligned and density-aware distances and augment evaluation with SNC; the proposed Diffusion Point Transformer generates higher-fidelity point clouds and outperforms prior methods on ShapeNet.

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

*Huanqi Wu,Huangbiao Xu,Runfeng Xie,Jiaxin Cai,Kaixin Zhang,Xiao Ke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sentence-to-Image Steganography和IVT基准，设计S^2LM利用LLM在图像中嵌入句子级语义信息，实验证明有效，扩展了语义隐写能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐写侧重比特级嵌入，难以承载句子级、语义丰富的信息；随着AIGC发展，对可隐藏的语义容量需求上升，因此提出语义隐写任务并探索利用LLM的可行性。

Method: 提出IVT基准数据集；设计S^2LM管线，利用LLM将句子/段落映射为适合嵌入图像的表示，并通过隐写编码与图像融合；在训练和解码阶段均引入LLM以提高语义保真度。

Result: 在定量与定性评估中，S^2LM在信息恢复率、图像视觉质量和隐蔽性之间取得良好折衷，能够成功恢复句子级信息并保持载体图像的不可察觉性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了将句子级语义信息嵌入图像的任务（Sentence-to-Image Steganography），并实现了一个基于大语言模型的系统S^2LM，通过在整个流程中调用LLM来编码高层语义信息。实验表明方法在可用性和隐蔽性上表现良好，拓展了语义隐写的新能力。

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

### [52] [Canonical Space Representation for 4D Panoptic Segmentation of Articulated Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05356)
*Manuel Gomes,Bogdan Raducanu,Miguel Oliveira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Artic4D数据集和CanonSeg4D方法，利用4D（时序+空间）信息和规范化空间对齐提升可动物体的全景分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数方法忽视了可动物体的时间动态性，且缺乏4D时序数据与评测基准，限制了对动态部件的一致性识别与分割研究。

Method: 构建4D注释数据集Artic4D（来源PartNet Mobility并合成传感器数据），提出CanonSeg4D：估计每帧到学习到的规范空间的偏移，利用该规范表示在帧间保持部件一致性以提升分割。

Result: 在Artic4D上，CanonSeg4D在更复杂场景中实现了比现有最先进方法更高的全景分割精度，体现了时序建模与规范对齐的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过引入时序建模与规范空间对齐，CanonSeg4D在Artic4D数据集上优于现有方法，证明了4D信息对可动物体理解的重要性。

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Dense Motion Captioning任务与CompMo数据集，并设计了DEMO模型，将大语言模型与运动适配器结合，实现对复杂3D人体动作序列的时序定位与字幕生成。在CompMo及改编基准上，DEMO显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要集中在文本到动作生成，缺乏对动作理解和详尽时序标注的数据与方法，短序列和少动作限制了研究。

Method: 设计了CompMo数据生成流程以获得包含2到10个动作的6万条序列和精确时序标注；提出DEMO模型，将大语言模型与简单运动适配器结合，训练以生成密集、时序接地的动作描述。

Result: CompMo包含60k条复杂动作序列，DEMO在CompMo和改编基准上显著优于现有方法，提供了鲁棒基线。

Conclusion: 引入Dense Motion Captioning任务与CompMo数据集，验证DEMO模型能在复杂、多动作的3D人体动作序列中实现准确的动作时序定位与文字描述，建立了该领域的强基线。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human motion and language integration have primarily
focused on text-to-motion generation, leaving the task of motion understanding
relatively unexplored. We introduce Dense Motion Captioning, a novel task that
aims to temporally localize and caption actions within 3D human motion
sequences. Current datasets fall short in providing detailed temporal
annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

*Zehui Feng,Tian Qiu,Tong Wu,Junxuan Li,Huayuan Xu,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PreResQ-R1，一种将绝对评分回归与相对排序一致性结合的强化学习框架，用于图像/视频视觉质量评估，通过双分支奖励和GRPO优化实现更细粒度、可解释的链式推理，在少量数据上实现SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大模型在质量评估上多依赖监督微调或仅排序损失，导致推理浅薄、分数校准差、跨域泛化弱，需一种能兼顾绝对评分与相对偏好的方法以提升稳定性和可解释性。

Method: 提出双分支奖励：一支建模样本内响应一致性（absolute regression），一支建模样本间偏好对齐（relative ranking），并通过Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）联合优化；对视频设计全局-时间与局部-空间的数据流策略。

Result: 在仅用6K图像和28K视频进行强化微调的情况下，于10个IQA和5个VQA基准上在SRCC和PLCC指标取得领先，IQA任务上分别提升约5.30%和2.15%，并生成与人类一致的推理链。

Conclusion: PreResQ-R1在少量强化微调数据下，实现了IQA与VQA多项基准的SOTA性能，且具备人类对齐的可解释推理痕迹，证明了将绝对与相对信号解耦并用强化学习优化的有效性。

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

TL;DR: 系统利用深度学习目标识别在AR中定位组件并显示逐步安装指示，避免人工预分类；通过LEGO雕塑装配验证可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce manual searching/sorting/labeling by linking instructions to real-time component locations via object recognition in AR

Method: Deep learning-based AR assembly with object recognition

Result: Prototype AR workflow that detects components, shows bounding boxes and placement; demonstrated with LEGO sculpture assembly case study

Conclusion: 深度学习目标识别可使AR装配流程更高效，减少预处理工作，但需处理识别精度、遮挡和多尺度问题以实现普适性。

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep
learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and
display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO
sculptures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏同时具备精确3D几何、高分辨率多视图图像与多样化受试者的数据集，导致个性化手部头像重建困难，特别是在复杂光照和有限视角下。

Method: 收集263名受试者的13k高质量手部扫描及90k多视角图像，使用基于物理的反向渲染训练多主体几何与材质先验，构建PALM-Net以从单张图像恢复可重光照的手部头像。

Result: Provides PALM dataset and PALM-Net baseline for hand avatar personalization

Conclusion: PALM和PALM-Net显著推动了真实世界手部建模研究，特别是在个性化、可重光照单图重建方面提供了标准化数据与基线方法。

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPRF利用transformer基础模型融合视觉和LiDAR，实现两阶段检索+显式6-DoF几何验证的多模态闭环检测，在S3LI系列数据集上优于现有检索方法，尤其在低纹理、无结构环境中表现更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在行星探测等GNSS不可用且地貌无结构、低纹理的环境中，单一模态（仅视觉或仅LiDAR）各有局限，视觉易混淆、LiDAR稀疏。融合transformer基础模型的多模态方法可弥补单模态短板，提高闭环检测的准确性与位姿估计的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用DINOv2提取视觉局部特征，采用SALAD进行聚合实现高效的两阶段视觉检索；对候选结果用SONATA生成的LiDAR描述子进行几何验证，得到显式6-DoF位姿。整体为多模态管线，先检索后验证，兼顾效率与精度。

Result: MPRF提出了一个多模态基于transformer的闭环检测管线，将视觉和LiDAR模态的基础模型结合，用于在行星探测等无GNSS、无结构环境中实现鲁棒的位姿回环检测。论文贡献包括：一是结合DINOv2特征与SALAD聚合的两阶段视觉检索策略用于高效候选筛选；二是引入SONATA基于LiDAR的描述子进行几何验证以实现显式6-DoF位姿估计；三是通过在S3LI及S3LI Vulcano数据集上的实验，展示了比现有检索方法在精度上的提升，并在低纹理区域提高了位姿估计的鲁棒性。该方法提供可解释的对应关系，利于SLAM后端优化，在精度、效率、可靠性间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 将视觉检索与LiDAR几何验证结合的多模态方法能显著提升在严苛户外环境中的闭环检测性能，并为SLAM提供可用的位姿与特征对应，展示了基础模型在统一识别与位姿估计方面的潜力。

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种只修改卷积层的可插拔持续学习方法，能在不改动主干、不开销显著增加的情况下为图像修复任务持续学习并利用历史知识提升新任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法在图像修复领域应用少，且需大幅修改网络结构或采用正则化方法，但图像修复任务之间差异大，正则化不适用，因此需要一种轻量、兼容性强的持续学习方案。

Method: 在卷积层上进行简单改动（未具体说明细节），创建知识库并通过该改动在新任务训练时适配过去任务的知识，从而避免对主干网络的结构性修改。

Result: 实验显示：引入新修复任务时不损害已有任务性能，新任务性能也能通过利用之前任务形成的知识库而得到提升；方法可与任意深度架构兼容，并在保持推理时间不变的前提下增加可训练参数。

Conclusion: 提出了一种无需改动主干结构、通过修改卷积层实现的持续学习方法，能在不显著增加计算和推理开销的情况下为新图像修复任务引入可训练参数，并保持对既有任务的性能。

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/aupendu/continual-restore.

TL;DR: 通过Text-to-Vec把文本映射为Wav2Vec2潜在语音特征，联合控制语音与人脸生成，并采用先用真实嵌入预训练再用TTS输出微调的两阶段训练，解决分布偏移，实现无真实音频情况下的同步、自然、保身份的说话人脸生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是在没有真实音频作为输入的场景下，直接从文本生成与语音高度同步且保身份的说话人脸与自然、富表现力的语音，克服级联TTS+视图生成管线带来的对齐与质量问题。

Method: 1) 用Text-to-Vec模块将文本生成Wav2Vec2嵌入；2) 用这些嵌入联合条件化语音与人脸生成模型（基于HierSpeech++潜在表示）；3) 两阶段训练：先在真实Wav2Vec2嵌入上预训练，再在TTS预测的嵌入上微调以缓解分布偏移。

Result: Paper proposes text-to-talking-face synthesis using latent speech representations from HierSpeech++. Introduces Text-to-Vec mapping from text to Wav2Vec2 embeddings to jointly condition speech and face generation. Uses two-stage training: pretrain on Wav2Vec2 embeddings, finetune on TTS outputs to handle distribution shift. Achieves tight audio-visual alignment, preserves speaker identity, produces natural expressive speech and synchronized facial motion without ground-truth audio. Experiments show conditioning on TTS-predicted latents outperforms cascaded pipelines, improving lip-sync and visual realism.

Conclusion: 该方法能在无真实音频的情况下生成高度对齐的音视频、保留说话人身份并提升唇 sync 与视觉逼真度，相较于级联管线有明显优势。

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云transformer依赖密集token，训练和推理成本高，作者认为很多token冗余且影响可扩展性，因而探索如何高效合并token以降低资源消耗。

Method: 建立点云token的图结构，利用全局信息（可能包括注意力或全局特征）判断相似或冗余token并进行合并，保留关键信息同时减少计算和内存开销；在多任务（语义分割、重建等）上进行验证。

Result: 在多个3D视觉任务上，gitmerge3D实现了显著的计算效率提升并保持竞争性性能，表明可将token削减至原来的5-10%而性能仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: 作者提出了gitmerge3D，通过全局信息引导的图结构token合并，能在不显著损失性能的情况下将token数量减少90-95%，表明3D transformer中存在大量冗余。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

TL;DR: 使用 Sentinel-1/2 中等分辨率影像可在大范围、快速评估中实现有效的建筑损毁检测；大模型与复杂架构对泛化提升有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在 VHR（超高分辨率）图像有限可得的情况下，是否可以使用公开可得、覆盖广的中等分辨率 Copernicus 数据来支持快速大范围的灾后建筑损毁评估。

Method: 构建 xBD-S12 数据集：将 10,315 对 Sentinel-1/2 影像与已标注的 xBD 数据在时空上对齐，进行一系列模型训练与评估实验，比较不同架构（包含复杂模型与地理空间基础模型）在损毁检测与制图任务上的效果与泛化能力。

Result: xBD-S12 数据集引入并对中等分辨率卫星影像在灾害后建筑损毁评估方面进行了验证。实验证明 10 米分辨率的 Sentinel-1/2 图像在许多灾害类型下能较好地检测和制图损毁建筑，尽管分辨率较低。复杂模型并未显著优于简单架构，且在未见灾害上的泛化能力较差；地理空间基础模型带来有限收益。作者发布了数据集、代码和模型以促进后续研究。

Conclusion: 中等分辨率的 Copernicus（Sentinel-1/2）影像可作为快速、大范围建筑损毁评估的可行数据来源；研究中复杂模型和地理空间基础模型对该任务帮助不大，且泛化表现是主要挑战。

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有照片日期估计多依赖场景线索或单人脸信息，面对多人物照片或需要更精确的时间推断时效果有限；通过利用人物身份与出生年可提供更强的时间线索，尤其是可利用多人信息聚合来提高准确性。

Method: 构建并发布了包含1.6M标注人脸（包含身份和出生年份、同一图像多人的标注）的CSFD-1.6M数据集；提出概率框架，将现代人脸识别和年龄估计模型的视觉证据与基于职业生涯的时间先验结合，用贝叶斯式或似然加权方式推断照片年份；并设计多人脸信息聚合策略，提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验证明：多人脸证据聚合能持续提升性能；所提出的方法显著优于强场景基线，尤其在包含多位可识别人物的图像上差距最大；表明该方法在电影剧照等含多人物的图像中效果显著。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种利用图像中人物面部信息推断照片拍摄年份的新方法，通过公开大规模数据集并结合概率框架融合人脸识别、年龄估计和职业生涯时间先验，提升了拍摄日期估计性能。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Conclusion: 该论文提出将语义引导的自然语言处理与先进视觉主干网络相结合，用于小目标检测，旨在提升小、复杂目标的检测精度并降低资源消耗。

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of
backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of
multi-scale objects, ensuring scalability and robustness in
resource-constrained environments. This study underscores the potential of
integrating natural language understanding with advanced backbone
architectures, setting new benchmarks in object detection accuracy, efficiency,
and adaptability to real-world challenges.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GroupKAN，一种将通道分组的Kolmogorov-Arnold网络变体，通过Grouped KAN Transform和Grouped KAN Activation将复杂度从O(C^2)降至O(C^2/G)，在三个医学图像分割数据集上比U-KAN更小参数且IoU更高，并提升可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决U-KAN在通道数增加时因全通道变换导致的O(C^2)复杂度和参数量问题，同时保持或提升准确性与可解释性，提供更适用于医学图像分割的轻量级可扩展模型。

Method: 基于U-KAN的Kolmogorov-Arnold模块，设计两种分组结构：Grouped KAN Transform将通道分为G组并在组内进行多变量样条映射以降低O(C^2)到O(C^2/G)的复杂度；Grouped KAN Activation在每组内共享样条基的逐通道非线性映射以实现高效token-wise非线性。将这两模块集成到轻量级编码器-解码器分割网络中进行训练与评估。

Result: 在BUSI、GlaS和CVC三个基准上，GroupKAN平均IoU为79.80%，比U-KAN提高1.11个百分点，参数量为3.02M，仅为U-KAN的47.6%（6.35M），并表现出更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GroupKAN在保持或提升分割性能的同时显著减少参数量和计算复杂度，能在医学图像分割任务中作为更可扩展且更可解释的替代方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出TimeSearch-R，用RL把视频片段搜索融入推理；引入GRPO-CSV进行自我验证并构建专用数据集，显著提升长期视频检索与理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手工搜索流程，缺乏端到端学习最优搜索策略；需要把搜索过程与推理耦合并保证检索决策的完整性。

Method: 提出将检索视为交替的文本-视频思考过程，用GRPO进行策略学习，并在其上加完整性自我验证（CSV），同时构建SFT冷启动与RL训练数据集。

Result: TimeSearch-R将时间检索重新表述为交替的文本-视频推理过程，通过强化学习 (GRPO-CSV) 学习搜索策略，并加入完整性自我验证提升检索完整性。

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R在若干长期视频检索与理解基准上取得显著提升，并在LongVideoBench上创下新SOTA。

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 作者构建了大规模空间感知与推理数据集，并设计渐进训练（监督微调+强化学习）来提升VLM的空间能力，在多个基准上显著领先且不损害泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通过增加专家编码器来强化VLM的空间能力会带来开销并损害泛化。作者希望在通用架构上通过数据和训练策略改进，实现类似人类的空间感知和推理，而无额外模块负担。

Method: 1) 构建VST-P（4.1M，19项技能，单视图/多图/视频）用于提升空间感知；2) 构建VST-R（135K）用于空间推理指令学习；3) 采用先监督微调建立基础空间知识，再用强化学习进一步提升推理能力的渐进训练流程。

Result: 提出Visual Spatial Tuning (VST)框架，通过构建大规模空间感知数据集（VST-P，4.1M样本）和推理数据集（VST-R，135K样本），并结合有监督微调与强化学习，提升视觉语言模型的空间感知与推理能力，取得若干空间基准的最先进结果。

Conclusion: VST能在不降低模型通用性的前提下显著增强VLM的空间感知与推理能力，并能扩展到视觉-语言-动作模型，推动更具物理根植性的AI。

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

### [68] [An Efficient Proximity Graph-based Approach to Table Union Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05082)
*Yiming Xie,Hua Dai,Mingfeng Jiang,Pengyue Li,zhengkai Zhang,Bohan Li*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出PGTUS：基于邻近图的多阶段检索框架，通过many-to-one匹配过滤和加强剪枝在保持召回率的同时显著加速多向量表合并搜索（3.6-6.0X）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多向量表嵌入能捕捉细粒度列级语义匹配，但在查询时需频繁求解二分图最大匹配，导致效率瓶颈；因此需要一种能保留多向量优点同时极大加速检索的近似/剪枝方法。

Method: 基于近邻图（proximity graph）构建索引，采用多阶段检索流程：初筛（可能使用近邻搜索），many-to-one双向匹配的过滤策略作为精炼阶段，以及增强剪枝策略以进一步缩小候选集，最后对少量候选执行精确的二分图最大匹配评分。

Result: Proposes PGTUS, a proximity-graph based multi-stage pipeline for efficient table union search using multi-vector table embeddings, with novel many-to-one matching filtering and enhanced pruning, achieving 3.6-6.0X speedups with comparable recall.

Conclusion: PGTUS在六个基准数据集上实现了显著的效率提升（3.6-6.0倍），同时召回率与现有方法相当，验证了其在多向量表检索场景的实用性。

Abstract: Neural embedding models are extensively employed in the table union search
problem, which aims to find semantically compatible tables that can be merged
with a given query table. In particular, multi-vector models, which represent a
table as a vector set (typically one vector per column), have been demonstrated
to achieve superior retrieval quality by capturing fine-grained semantic
alignments. However, this problem faces more severe efficiency challenges than
the single-vector problem due to the inherent dependency on bipartite graph
maximum matching to compute unionability scores. Therefore, this paper proposes
an efficient Proximity Graph-based Table Union Search (PGTUS) approach. PGTUS
employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines a novel refinement strategy, a
filtering strategy based on many-to-one bipartite matching. Besides, we propose
an enhanced pruning strategy to prune the candidate set, which further improve
the search efficiency. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves 3.6-6.0X speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining comparable recall rates.
