### [1] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transform images to Fourier domain and train ResNet50 to detect StyleGAN fakes; achieves ~93% accuracy and AUC 0.95, showing frequency fingerprints


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs produce photorealistic images challenging for forensics; frequency artifacts may reveal synthetic origin

Method: frequency-domain + deep learning

Result: 2D DFT on images then ResNet50 classifier achieves 92.8% accuracy and AUC 0.95, outperforming spatial-domain model

Conclusion: GAN images have distinct frequency-domain fingerprints; combining signal processing and deep learning improves forensic detection and industrial trustworthiness

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将ViT架构与对比学习目标结合用于多视图3D形状表示学习，显著提高性能（ModelNet10 ~90.6%），兼顾全局形状语义与局部判别特征，减少对大量标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN在从2D图像识别3D对象时常忽视关键形状关系且需大量标注数据；因此探寻ViT与对比学习的结合以提升3D形状表征能力并减少标注需求。

Method: 使用ViT作为主干网络，输入多视图2D图像，采用监督与自监督对比损失进行训练以优化全局语义与局部判别表示，通过大量实验在下游3D任务（如ModelNet10）评估表现。

Result: The paper empirically shows Vision Transformers (ViTs) combined with supervised and self-supervised contrastive objectives produce strong 3D shape representations from multi-view images, outperforming CNN-based approaches and reducing reliance on large labeled datasets; supervised contrastive achieved ~90.6% on ModelNet10.

Conclusion: 结合ViT与对比学习能有效捕捉3D形状的全局与局部特征，在多视图3D分析任务上表现优异，验证了统一对比与3D形状理解管线的可行性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [3] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack fuses camera and LiDAR BEV features in a two-stage transformer tracker plus temporal smoother, cutting identity switches and improving 3D MOT performance without heavy pretraining


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: improve transformer tracking by using multi-sensor fusion and smoothing to reduce ID switches and jitter

Method: transformer-based multimodal tracking

Result: a modular framework FutrTrack with transformer smoother and fusion-driven tracker; achieves aMOTA 74.7 on nuScenes and strong KITTI results

Conclusion: multimodal BEV features and transformer-based smoothing and tracking substantially improve query-based tracking, enabling competitive 3D MOT performance with limited data

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [4] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究在线标签平滑（OLS）在医学影像分类中的效果。OLS在训练过程中根据模型预测动态调整软标签，优于传统硬标签、常规标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏。实验在RadImageNet上使用ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19，结果显示OLS提高Top-1/Top-5准确率，并使特征嵌入更紧凑、分离更好，从而改善表示学习和模型校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标签平滑虽能减少过度自信，但忽略类间关系；医学影像分类中准确性与不确定性评估至关重要，因此需更动态、更反映类间相似性的标签平滑方法。

Method: 提出并应用在线标签平滑（OLS）：训练期间根据模型当前预测分布动态更新软标签，从而反映类别间关系。将OLS与硬标签、传统标签平滑和教师无监督蒸馏比较，在RadImageNet上使用ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19进行评估，分析Top-1/Top-5准确率与特征嵌入结构。

Result: 实验结果表明OLS在三种网络上均能提升Top-1与Top-5准确率，生成更紧凑且分离更好的特征嵌入，且较传统方法改善了模型校准。

Conclusion: OLS在大型医学影像数据集上能稳定提升分类准确率与校准性能，且改进了特征表示，具有在医疗成像领域提高可信度的实用潜力。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

TL;DR: 针对鱼眼交通监控图像的畸变和分辨率问题，本文用预/后处理+多模型集成提升检测一致性，在AI City 2025竞赛中取得F1=0.6366，位列第8。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼摄像头能以单点视角覆盖大范围交通场景，但强径向畸变和非均匀分辨率导致常规检测器在图像边缘等处表现较差，因而需要专门的处理流程和模型组合以提升检测鲁棒性。

Method: 方法包括：1) 对鱼眼图像进行预处理以缓解径向畸变和分辨率不均的问题（具体技术细节未在摘要中详述）；2) 训练若干先进目标检测模型；3) 采用后处理步骤提升不同区域的检测一致性；4) 使用模型集成策略融合多模型输出以提高总体检测性能。

Result: 在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4上，本方法取得F1=0.6366，排名62队中第8名，证明了该框架在应对鱼眼图像挑战上的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了针对鱼眼摄像机交通监控中强径向畸变和非均匀分辨率问题的检测框架，通过简单有效的预处理和后处理管线以及检测模型集成，提高了在畸变严重区域（如图像边界）的检测一致性和精度。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 针对3DGS在训练视角外的噪声问题，提出了一种基于中间梯度灵敏度评分的实时渲染感知滤波器，能在渲染时抑制各向异性引发的不确定性，提升视觉质量且无需再训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当相机位置远离训练数据分布时，3DGS模型在外推区域会产生大量噪声，传统方法（如NeRF的贝叶斯方法）要么需要昂贵的重训练/微调，要么不能实时应用，因而需要一种轻量、实时且能直接在渲染阶段抑制生成不确定性的方案。

Method: 作者基于中间梯度计算灵敏度分数，识别由各向异性取向引起的不稳定像素或高斯体，并在渲染管线中实时应用滤波以平滑颜色、密度和几何不确定性；该方法无需训练或微调，可直接嵌入现有3DGS渲染流程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在视觉质量、真实感和一致性上显著优于基于NeRF的现有方法（例如BayesRays），并能实时运行且无需额外训练。作者在网页上公开了代码与结果（链接）。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种实时渲染感知滤波器，用于缓解3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）在训练视角外推时的视觉噪声问题，通过使用来自中间梯度的灵敏度评分，针对各向异性方向不稳定性进行过滤，从而抑制生成不确定性并保持高视觉保真。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainPuzzle fuses physics-based time-reversal migration with a transformer+graph attention fusion network to reconstruct quantitative brain SoS from partial-array, low-SNR transcranial ultrasound, outperforming baseline methods on synthetic datasets


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: overcome skull-induced signal degradation and sparse clinical apertures to enable quantitative transcranial ultrasound SoS mapping

Method: hybrid two-stage BrainPuzzle combining physics and ML

Result: two-stage pipeline: time-reversal migration to get migration fragments; transformer-based super-resolution encoder-decoder with graph-based attention unit fuses fragments into accurate SoS images; partial-array movable low-count transducer strategy improves feasibility

Conclusion: hybrid physics-ML approach with partial-array acquisition enables more accurate and complete transcranial SoS reconstruction, promising for quantitative ultrasound brain imaging.

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [8] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Models default to Global-North, modern depictions; I2I editing reduces cultural fidelity despite stable metrics; edits use superficial cues and often keep source identity for Global-South.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill gap in analysis of I2I editors and provide cross-country, era-aware diagnostics of cultural bias in generative models.

Method: Unified evaluation across six countries, 8-category/36-subcategory schema, era-aware prompts; combined automatic metrics, retrieval-augmented VQA, and native-expert human judgments; used open models with fixed settings.

Result: The paper audits cultural bias in generative image models across T2I and I2I, providing datasets and evaluations.

Conclusion: Current generative image systems poorly preserve cultural and era-specific attributes, with I2I editing particularly unreliable; standardized benchmark released for reproducible evaluation.

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [9] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FIBAR: a simple, CPU-friendly, asynchronous filter-based method for event-camera image reconstruction using IIR integration plus stale-pixel Gaussian blurring; faster on CPU but lower quality than neural nets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to provide a simpler, efficient method to reconstruct intensity images from events of moving event cameras without heavy neural networks and GPUs, enabling asynchronous read-out and high CPU throughput.

Method: Integrate per-pixel event deltas using a temporal digital IIR filter; maintain a window of recently updated pixels to detect stale pixels; assume no events imply low gradient for moving cameras, so blur stale pixels with Gaussian; allow arbitrary-time image read-out; optimized CPU implementation achieving high event-throughput.

Result: They propose FIBAR: integrate event-induced intensity changes with a temporal IIR filter, detect stale pixels via a novel window-based algorithm, blur stale pixels with a Gaussian when events are absent, and enable asynchronous read-out. FIBAR runs at 42M ev/s (with filtering) or 140M ev/s (without) on a laptop CPU; reconstruction is noisier and has ghosting compared to neural methods but works for tasks like fiducial marker detection.

Conclusion: FIBAR offers a lightweight, asynchronous alternative for event-image reconstruction suitable for some applications despite higher noise and ghosting; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出TBTLRR，一种学习酉变换的双边张量低秩表示，结合ℓ_{1/2}与Frobenius正则化，并用改进ADMM求解，提升了对噪声的鲁棒性和聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进张量低秩表示在图像聚类中的鲁棒性和适应性，克服固定变换导致的噪声敏感性，增强全局与局部相关性的捕捉能力。

Method: 构建包含可学习酉变换的张量核范数的非凸目标，引入双边低秩约束及ℓ_{1/2}和Frobenius噪声正则项，设计基于ADMM的交替优化步骤，并证明收敛性，最后在多个聚类数据集上做实验验证。

Result: 提出了TBTLRR模型：通过学习任意酉变换引入数据自适应的张量核范数，利用双边结构挖掘样本与特征间的局部相关性，并结合ℓ_{1/2}范数与Frobenius范数处理复杂噪声；开发了基于ADMM的高效优化算法并给出收敛性理论；在聚类任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 学习变换与双边结构能更有效捕捉张量数据的全局与局部相关性，配合非凸噪声正则化和ADMM优化，能显著提升图像聚类效果，并保证算法收敛。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决内镜手术视频格式异构和隐私问题，促进视频用于培训、研究和质量改进

Method: 遵循软件开发生命周期，基于用户中心迭代设计；初期内部基于十项可用性启发式评估收集需求，后期外部使用启发式和技术接受模型评估可用性与接受度，并进行硬件基准测试与统计分析

Result: 开发了Endoshare：跨平台、源代码可用的应用，能合并、标准化和去识别内镜手术视频；进行了基于用户反馈的软件生命周期开发和可用性/接受度测试，结果显示高可用性和接受度；处理时间受模式、时长和计算能力影响；软件开源可访问

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了透明、用户友好的标准化和隐私保护的视频管理流程；需进一步进行合规认证与更广泛的互操作性验证以替代专有系统

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文指出自注意力的优势在于自适应路由与侧抑制，提出ATConv将这两点融入卷积，进而在分类与生成任务上用小核超越多种自注意力方法，达到高精度与高效率的兼顾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自注意力虽表达力强但复杂度高，传统卷积效率好但表达力不足；作者希望找出自注意力胜出的本质原则并将其注入卷积，兼顾性能与效率。

Method: 作者重新审视CNN设计，提出两个关键理论洞见（自适应路由与侧抑制），并据此将卷积算子改造为Attentive Convolution（ATConv），用仅3×3卷积核实现动态位置信息调度和权重竞争；基于ATConv构建AttNet网络族并在图像分类与扩散生成任务中替换SA验证效果。

Result: ATConv在ImageNet-1K上构建的AttNet达到84.4% Top-1（27M参数），在扩散模型中替换SA能降低FID并加速采样；整体用3×3核即可优于多种SA机制。

Conclusion: 本文提出ATConv，通过引入自适应路由和侧抑制原理，弥合了卷积与自注意力在表达力上的差距，从而在多项视觉任务上超越多种自注意力机制，且参数与计算更优。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在生成像素级手绘草图等抽象表达的效果仍有限，主要原因是VAE解码器无法很好地表示草图特征且传统文本对齐方法难以保证语义一致性。

Method: 对变分自编码器(VAE)进行微调以提升潜在解码对草图特征的捕捉；引入基于视觉问答(VQA)的奖励函数进行强化学习以增强文本-图像对齐与语义一致性；构建并使用新数据集SketchDUO进行训练与评估。

Result: 实验表明StableSketcher在风格保真度和提示词对齐性上优于Stable Diffusion基线，并通过SketchDUO数据集验证了方法有效性。

Conclusion: StableSketcher通过对VAE进行微调和引入基于VQA的强化学习奖励，实现了更符合提示词的手绘风格草图生成，相较于Stable Diffusion基线在风格保真度和文本-图像对齐上有显著提升。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Authors generate accurate synthetic, instance-level descriptive captions using MLLMs with domain guidance, then train BIOCAP to improve biological image-text alignment, boosting classification and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Use descriptive captions to provide additional supervision for biological multimodal foundation models, aligning images and text in a shared latent morphospace to emphasize diagnostic traits and reduce spurious correlations.

Method: Generate analysis of paper abstract

Result: Created BIOCAP (BIOCLIP with Captions) by generating synthetic instance-specific captions via MLLMs guided by Wikipedia visual info and taxon-tailored examples; these captions improved species classification and text-image retrieval performance.

Conclusion: Descriptive captions, even synthetically generated with domain-aware prompts, are valuable supervision for biological multimodal models, enabling richer semantics and better downstream performance.

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Motivation: 现有通用目标检测与跟踪方法在面对快速移动小目标（如壁球）时表现不足，尤其在三维定位和快速方向变化、遮挡等复杂场景中。

Method: 采用基于深度学习的RGB-D检测器与融合了运动学方程的物理跟踪器，包含异常检测与修正模块以应对漏检和异常观测。

Result: 在自建壁球数据集上，所提系统相比卡尔曼滤波器基线在平均位移误差上最多降低70%，在遮挡和快速转向场景下表现更稳健。

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

### [16] [Inverse Image-Based Rendering for Light Field Generation from Single Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20132)
*Hyunjun Jung,Hae-Gon Jeon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种从单张图片生成light field的新方法，通过存储并交互源光流（cross-attention）来预测任意目标视角光线颜色，结合迭代更新生成遮挡外的内容，训练一次后具备较好泛化性并优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展单张图像生成light field的能力，降低获取light fields的成本和设备依赖，使得单张图片也能生成多视角渲染与摄影级效果。

Method: 设计神经渲染流水线：1) 从输入图像提取并存储源光流；2) 通过cross-attention计算源光流之间关系；3) 基于关系预测目标光线颜色；4) 将生成的新视角中视外内容加入源光流集合，迭代生成以保持遮挡一致性。

Result: 提出了“inverse image-based rendering”方法：从单张图像恢复光流（light flows），利用神经渲染器通过cross-attention在源光流之间建立关系，迭代生成新视角并更新源光流以填补视外/遮挡内容；训练一次后可在多数据集上泛化且优于相关方法。

Conclusion: 逆向基于图像的渲染通过重建像素空间的光流并用注意力机制推断新视角光线，提供了无需多视图或专用设备即可生成高质量light fields的途径，并在多数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

TL;DR: LogitGap利用最大logit与其余logit的差异，并通过无训练的选择策略聚焦信息量更大的一部分logit，从而显著提升后验OOD检测效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后验方法未充分利用logits空 间中丰富的信息，特别是最大logit与其余logit之间的关系

Method: 提出了LogitGap的新颖后验O O D 检测方法

Result: 在视觉语言与仅视觉模型上的多组基准测试中，LogitGap在各类OOD场景下持续达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和大量实验证明，LogitGap能有效增强ID与OOD样本的可分性，并实现稳定的SOTA表现

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PartNeXt是一个含纹理、覆盖50类、23K+模型的细粒度层级3D部件数据集，改进了标注可扩展性并暴露了当前分割与3D-LLM方法在细粒度部件理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D部件数据集多为无纹理几何体且依赖专家标注，限制了可扩展性和对真实场景的适用性，因此需要一个具备纹理信息、可扩展标注且覆盖细粒度层级标签的新数据集。

Method: 构建并公开一个包含逾23,000个高质量有纹理3D模型的数据库，提供跨50类的层级细粒度部件标签；设计了可扩展的注释流程并导入纹理感知标签；基于该数据集对类无关部件分割和3D部件问答任务进行基准评测，同时用PartNeXt训练Point-SAM以验证数据提升效果。

Result: 提供了一个包含23,000+纹理化模型且带层级细粒度部件标签的数据集；基准测试显示当前最先进方法在细粒度和叶节点部件上表现欠佳；3D-LLMs在开放词汇部件定位上存在明显短板；用PartNeXt训练的Point-SAM较用PartNet训练时有显著提升。

Conclusion: PartNeXt显著提升了3D部件理解数据集的质量与实用性，通过引入纹理化模型和可扩展标注流程，弥补了现有数据集（如PartNet）在可扩展性和细粒度标注方面的不足。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

*Eduardo R. Corral-Soto,Yang Liu,Yuan Ren,Bai Dongfeng,Liu Bingbing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出从单张RGB图像估计自行车与骑车者的类别级8D位姿，除3D平移与旋转外，还估计转向把手与脚踏的相对旋转，从而更精细地推断自行车姿态与行进方向。模型联合预测8D位姿与3D关键点，并用合成与真实图像混合训练，在真实图像上表现出竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统6D位姿只能描述刚体物体，但自行车为关节连接的可动部件，转向角与踏板角会改变3D包围盒和真实行进方向，因而需要更高维度位姿表示来精确推断骑行方向与行为预测，提升自动驾驶对骑行者的安全感知。

Method: 提出一个联合网络从单张RGB图像回归自行车的3D平移、3D旋转以及把手和脚踏的相对旋转角（总计8维），同时回归3D关键点。训练时结合合成数据与真实图像以提高泛化能力，并在测试时直接从图像预测8D位姿与关键点进行评估。

Result: 在自建或公开数据集上对8D位姿参数进行了评估，方法在估计把手与踏板角度、3D关键点与3D位姿上取得了令人鼓舞的结果，并在传统6D评测指标上与基于刚体模板的类别级6D位姿估计方法表现相当或接近。

Conclusion: 通过引入额外的把手与脚踏旋转角参数，本文扩展了传统6D到8D位姿表示，实现了对可动部件的建模，并在单张RGB图像上成功估计出细粒度的自行车位姿，实验表明其在8D参数与关键点估计上具有可行性且在6D基准上与现有方法竞争。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

TL;DR: Use unsupervised visual and textual data at test time to adapt multimodal prototypes with an adaptive weight and a priority queue, aligning prototypes via collaborative learning to handle unseen compositions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address distribution shift in CZSL caused by unseen recomposed attribute-object pairs at test time by leveraging unsupervised multimodal data to update prototypes

Method: Prototype updating with multimodal test-time accumulation

Result: State-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks in closed-world and open-world settings; improved adaptation to distribution shift via adaptive update weighting and dynamic priority queue

Conclusion: Test-time multimodal prototype accumulation with adaptive weighting and historical image queue improves CZSL robustness to label-space distribution shift and achieves SOTA results.

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

Motivation: 将信息瓶颈(Information Bottleneck, IB)框架引入GAN优化，以实现无监督的可分解表示学习

Method: 基于GAN架构，借鉴InfoGAN但不同的是在生成器中增加一个可训练的中间随机层；通过信息瓶颈约束该层与生成输出之间的互信息；该层作为可学习的潜变量分布与生成器联合训练；在dSprites、Color-dSprites、CelebA及3D Chairs上进行定量(FID, disentanglement scores)与定性评估

Result: 提出IB-GAN：在生成器中引入中间随机层以约束输入与生成输出的互信息，作为可学习的潜变量分布并与生成器端到端训练；在dSprites和Color-dSprites上实现与beta-VAE竞品的可分解性评分并优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs上生成样本在FID上优于beta-VAE和InfoGAN

Conclusion: IB-GAN能利用中间随机层和IB约束在无监督条件下学习可分解、可解释的潜空间，并在多项任务上表现出竞争力或优势

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA
and 3D Chairs dataset.

Motivation: 解决立体视频深度估计中的时序一致性问题，在保证计算效率的同时建模长程时序信息。

Method: 构建PPM记忆模块：先通过'pick'过程筛选与当前帧最相关的历史帧以保持记忆紧凑，然后通过'play'过程对选中帧进行自适应权重分配并进行时空聚合，用于动态立体匹配网络的特征/代价构建。

Result: 提出PPMStereo，通过Pick-and-Play Memory (PPM)模块维护紧凑且信息丰富的记忆缓冲区，实现长程时空一致性建模和高效动态立体匹配，实验表明在准确性和时序一致性上达到或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: PPMStereo在维持低计算代价的同时，有效建模长程时空一致性，提升深度估计的精度与时序稳定性。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

TL;DR: TL;DR：分析54个公开脑MRI数据集后发现显著异质性与预处理残差，提示构建泛化基础模型需采用预处理感知与领域自适应策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机：构建可泛化的脑MRI基础模型依赖于大量、多样且一致的数据，但当前公开资源的规模、组成和预处理差异未被系统性评估，限制了模型开发与跨数据集迁移性能。因此需要对这些因素进行结构化分析，为模型设计提供依据。

Method: 方法：汇总并分析54个公开脑MRI数据集（>538,031例）在数据集层面（模态组成、疾病覆盖、规模）和图像层面（体素间距、方向、强度分布）的差异；选取15个代表性数据集定量评估预处理步骤（强度归一化、偏振场校正、颅脑去除、空间配准、插值）对体素统计与几何的影响；最后使用3D DenseNet121在特征空间进行案例研究，评估标准化预处理后残余协变量漂移。

Result: 结果：发现大规模健康队列与小型临床队列间存在强烈不平衡；体素间距、方向与强度分布显著异质；预处理能改善但无法完全消除数据集间差异；在3D DenseNet121特征空间也检测到残余协变量漂移，表明仅靠标准化预处理不足以实现跨数据集无偏表征。

Conclusion: 论文结论：公开脑MRI数据集在规模、模态与预处理一致性方面存在显著异质性。尽管标准化预处理能改善同一数据集内一致性，但数据集间仍保留残留差异（协变量漂移），这对泛化的基础模型构建构成挑战，需要引入预处理感知与领域自适应策略。

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

*Bingjie Gao,Qianli Ma,Xiaoxue Wu,Shuai Yang,Guanzhou Lan,Haonan Zhao,Jiaxuan Chen,Qingyang Liu,Yu Qiao,Xinyuan Chen,Yaohui Wang,Li Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPO++通过检索增强重写、闭环样本特定迭代优化和基于优化对的LLM微调，在不修改生成模型的前提下大幅提升文本到视频生成质量，具有模型无关、成本低、可扩展的优点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户输入的简短、无结构、与训练数据分布不一致的提示词，提升扩散式文本到视频生成模型的生成质量。

Method: 三阶段方法：Stage1使用关系图检索相关修饰语并重写提示以对齐训练分布；Stage2用多源反馈（语义、空间、时间、光流等）对单样本迭代优化提示；Stage3用SSPO生成的优化对微调重写器LLM以内化优化策略并实现高效推理前提示生成。

Result: 提出RAPO++，一个跨阶段提示词优化框架，包括训练数据对齐的检索增强重写（RAPO）、测试时的样本特定迭代优化（SSPO）及利用优化对微调重写器LLM，从而显著提升语义对齐、组合性、时间一致性和物理合理性。

Conclusion: RAPO++在多个T2V模型和基准上显著优于现有方法，证明了跨阶段提示优化能有效提升语义、组合推理、时间稳定性和物理合理性，并可作为通用的提示优化方案。

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing
task-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt
generation even before inference. Extensive experiments across five
state-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++
achieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,
temporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods
by large margins. Our results highlight RAPO++ as a model-agnostic,
cost-efficient, and scalable solution that sets a new standard for prompt
optimization in T2V generation. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FlowCycle，一种无需反演的基于flow的文本驱动图像编辑方法。其核心是学习目标感知的中间状态，通过可学习噪声参数化腐蚀，并在循环一致性约束下优化，使中间状态选择性腐蚀与编辑相关的内容并保留无关内容，从而在保持源图像一致性的同时实现准确修改。实验证明在编辑质量和一致性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法构造的中间状态与目标无关，主要侧重源图像重建，导致在目标与源显著不同的情况下编辑能力受限或结果不一致；因此需要目标感知的中间状态来选择性腐蚀编辑相关区域并保留无关内容。

Method: 提出将中间状态的构建参数化为可学习噪声，并通过一个正向编辑和反向恢复的循环过程以双向一致性约束进行优化；该过程无需对源图像做反演，属于flow模型框架下的腐蚀-恢复范式改进。

Result: 大量消融实验与对比显示FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面超越最先进的方法。

Conclusion: FlowCycle能学出目标感知的中间状态，显著提升文本驱动图像编辑在保持源一致性和实现大幅修改时的性能，优于当前主流基线。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出CURL：利用空间和时间对比学习及任务采样和概率微调，从长超声视频中自监督学习胎动表示，在92例数据上实现78.01%敏感性和81.60% AUROC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve objective detection of fetal movements in long ultrasound videos where traditional methods (maternal perception, CTG) are subjective or inaccurate.

Method: Dual-contrastive loss (spatial + temporal), task-specific sampling to separate movement/non-movement segments during training, and probabilistic fine-tuning for inference on arbitrarily long recordings.

Result: CURL, a self-supervised dual-contrastive (spatial+temporal) learning framework with task-specific sampling and probabilistic fine-tuning, achieves 78.01% sensitivity and 81.60% AUROC on 92-subject in-house dataset (30-min sessions).

Conclusion: Self-supervised contrastive learning with task-aware sampling and probabilistic fine-tuning can yield robust fetal movement detection from long ultrasound videos, enabling more objective prenatal monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Motivation: 扩散模型用于图像编辑时，图像反演引入的近似误差由于中间生成步骤缺乏精确监督，限制了编辑性能；VQ模型的中间量化表示可被精确获取，提供更有效的反演监督，从而提升编辑质量。

Method: 提出EditInfinity：基于Infinity（二值量化生成模型）的参数高效自适应方法；引入结合文本提示修正和图像风格保留的高效图像反演机制；并设计整体平滑策略以在编辑时保持源图像高保真并实现语义对齐。

Conclusion: 该论文提出将二值量化（VQ-based）生成模型用于文本驱动的图像编辑，通过利用可获得的精确中间量化表示，解决传统扩散模型在图像反演阶段的近似误差问题，实现更精确的反演与编辑。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

### [30] [Why LVLMs Are More Prone to Hallucinations in Longer Responses: The Role of Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20229)
*Ge Zheng,Jiaye Qian,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者提出上下文依赖性而非长度本身导致长回复幻觉的假设，并提出induce-detect-suppress框架，通过诱发幻觉样本、早期检测高风险情况并在解码时抑制对象级幻觉，实验显示在各基准上显著降低幻觉，验证了假设并为长回复幻觉研究提供方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到LVLM在长、自由形式回复中更易出现幻觉，研究者想探究这是否仅由长度累积误差引起，或是有更深层机制（如对上下文的依赖）导致，并基于此设计更有效的缓解策略。

Method: 通过初步实验验证问题本质，构建了诱发性上下文来主动触发幻觉样本，训练/使用检测器识别高风险情况，并在解码阶段对可能的对象级幻觉进行抑制干预，结合各种基准评测验证方法有效性。

Result: 在所有基准上均取得一致且显著的改进：检测模块表现强劲，抑制策略在解码时减少了对象级幻觉，整体验证了基于上下文依赖的假设。

Conclusion: 本文结论认为长回答中的幻觉并非直接由长度导致，而是由于为保持连贯与完整性，模型在更长上下文中更依赖上下文，从而增加了出错风险。基于此提出的induce-detect-suppress框架能够通过诱发、检测并抑制对象级幻觉，显著降低幻觉率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

TL;DR: COS3D introduces collaborative fields combining instance and language representations, novel mapping and two-stage training plus adaptive prompt refinement, yielding superior open-vocabulary 3D segmentation and versatile applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation needs joint understanding of segmentation and language; existing Gaussian-splatting methods either use single language field (poor segmentation) or pre-computed class-agnostic segmentation (error accumulation).

Method: Introduce collaborative field (instance + language fields); instance-to-language feature mapping during training; two-stage training strategy; adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement during inference; implemented on Gaussian splatting pipeline; evaluated on benchmarks and applications.

Result: Propose COS3D, collaborative prompt-segmentation framework with a collaborative field (instance + language fields), instance-to-language feature mapping, two-stage training, and adaptive language-to-instance prompt refinement; achieves SOTA on benchmarks and diverse applications.

Conclusion: COS3D effectively integrates language and segmentation cues via collaborative fields and tailored training/inference strategies, outperforming prior Gaussian-splatting methods and enabling multiple downstream 3D segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DualGround，一种将句子级([EOS])和短语级（聚类词token）语义分离的双分支VTG模型，通过角色感知跨模态交互和短语结构建模提升细粒度时序对齐，在QVHighlights和Charades-STA上达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VTG方法在跨模态注意力中对所有文本token一视同仁，导致模型过度依赖[EOS]的全局语义而忽视词级信号，限制了细粒度时序对齐能力。

Method: 双分支架构：①句子分支：将[EOS]通过句子级路径与视频进行全局对齐；②短语分支：将词token聚类为短语单元，进行局部对齐；引入token-role-aware cross-modal attention和联合建模损失，实现结构化语义解耦与多粒度对齐。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA上，DualGround在Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务均达SOTA性能，表明解耦语义建模有效提升视频-文本对齐的粗粒度与细粒度表现。

Conclusion: DualGround通过显式分离全局与局部语义并引入token-role-aware交互和短语级上下文建模，既改善句子级对齐也提升细粒度时序定位，实验证明在MR和HD任务上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

TL;DR: 本文通过掩码位置编码与条带卷积的上下文增强，提出EDGeo提升跨视图目标地理定位性能，实验显示优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅用关键点二维坐标进行位置编码，忽略目标形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视图匹配能力受限；另外卫星图像中存在拉长的条带状目标（如长建筑），需要更强的长程上下文建模。

Method: 提出Mask-based Positional Encoding (MPE) 将目标的分割掩码作为位置编码输入，以同时捕捉空间坐标和目标轮廓；设计Context Enhancement Module (CEM)，使用水平与垂直条带卷积核提取长程条带状上下文信息；将两者整合到一个端到端框架EDGeo进行特征匹配与定位。

Result: 在CVOGL与VIGOR-Building两个公开数据集上进行大量实验，在挑战性的地面到卫星场景下，定位精度较最优方法提升3.39%，证明了MPE与CEM对跨视图匹配的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文通过引入基于分割掩码的位置编码和上下文增强模块，显著提升了跨视图目标地理定位的鲁棒性和精度。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

TL;DR: CMC uses pseudo-label unimodal pretraining and a parameter-free fusion with a consensus router to reduce text dominance and handle cross-modal semantic conflicts, achieving SOTA-level results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address semantic inconsistencies and text-dominance in multimodal emotion recognition to improve robustness and accuracy.

Method: Unimodal pretraining + parameter-free fusion + consensus routing

Result: CMC matches or outperforms SOTA on CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI and shows robustness on inconsistent semantic cases.

Conclusion: The proposed CMC framework improves MER robustness by calibrating unimodal contributions through self-supervised pseudo labels and guided fusion, leading to competitive or superior performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the

TL;DR: 针对VCR任务中的数据偏见问题，提出VCR-OOD数据集并使用因果分析与反向调整结合答案词典的方法进行去偏，实验证明有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VCR方法尽管在准确率上表现良好，但容易依赖数据中的统计或共现偏差导致泛化性差，缺乏系统化的去偏评估与方法，因此需要构建OOD评测集并提出有效去偏手段。

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

TL;DR: KINN uses physics-informed compression and aggregation plus semantic compression/self-distillation to extract sparse, interpretable features from CV-SAR data, achieving SOTA parameter-efficient recognition and robust generalization in data-scarce and OOD settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address representation trilemma (generalization, interpretability, efficiency) in CV-SAR recognition under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios by leveraging electromagnetic scattering priors.

Method: Three-stage 'compression-aggregation-compression' pipeline: physics-guided compression via dictionary processor and sparse unfolding network; aggregation of enriched representations; semantic compression with compact classifier and self-distillation; implemented in small CNN and ViT variants and evaluated on five benchmarks.

Result: Proposed KINN: a lightweight 'compression-aggregation-compression' architecture with physics-guided dictionary processor, sparse unfolding network, aggregation module, and semantic compression with self-distillation; instantiated in CNN and ViT variants (~0.7M, 0.95M parameters). Achieves state-of-the-art parameter-efficient recognition, strong generalization, OOD robustness, and interpretability across five SAR benchmarks.

Conclusion: KINN effectively resolves the representation trilemma for CV-SAR, providing a compact, interpretable, and generalizable model for trustworthy SAR image analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

TL;DR: DMC^3 generates positive/negative counterfactual textual and visual samples and uses contrastive loss to better distinguish events and interactions in egocentric VideoQA, improving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in egocentric VideoQA including multiple events and hand-object interactions by enhancing representation via counterfactual samples and contrastive learning.

Method: Build baseline egocentric VideoQA model; generate textual positives/negatives via event description paraphrasing; generate visual positives/negatives via core interaction mining (hand-object interactions); feed originals and counterfactuals into model and apply contrastive loss to pull positives close and push negatives away.

Result: Proposed DMC^3 framework with baseline, counterfactual sample construction (textual paraphrasing and visual core interaction mining), and contrastive optimization; achieves SOTA on EgoTaskQA (52.51% normal, 46.04% indirect) and QAEGO4D (13.2%).

Conclusion: Counterfactual contrastive construction effectively improves egocentric VideoQA by aligning original samples with positive counterfactuals and distancing negatives, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将自然语言指令视为静态用户意图代理，忽略了指令多样性和质量对grounding性能的影响。作者发现现有数据集指令有23.3%的缺陷，且利用推理时指令多样性可提高高达76%的相对性能，因而提出将指令作为动态推理资源来改进grounding。

Method: 两阶段训练：1) 合成多样化指令并在SFT上训练模型以学习多视角推理；2) 使用强化学习优化在推理时选择和组合指令路径（pathway selection/composition）。在推理阶段，模型可从多条候选推理路径中选取最有效的执行。

Conclusion: 把指令作为可选的、可组合的推理路径并在训练中灌输多视角能力，结合RL优化路径选择，可以显著提高GUI grounding性能并减少SFT+RL中的策略崩塌问题。UI-Ins系列模型在多个基准上实现SOTA结果，且具备 emergent reasoning 能力和良好的代理性能。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a

refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperET leverages hyperbolic geometry and dynamic radius adjustment with Möbius multiplication parametrized by diagonal/block-diagonal/banded matrices to efficiently align vision encoders to language, improving MLLMs with <1% extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing vision encoders lack multi-granularity alignment with language, causing MLLMs to need huge compute. Hyperbolic space models hierarchies naturally and can bridge granularity gaps efficiently.

Method: Introduce hyperbolic space alignment with dynamic radius adjustment; implement Möbius multiplication with learnable diagonal, block-diagonal, or banded matrices to transform visual features to match textual hierarchies; train efficiently with minimal parameter overhead.

Result: This paper proposes HyperET, an efficient training paradigm using hyperbolic space to align visual and textual representations at arbitrary granularity for MLLMs.

Conclusion: HyperET effectively bridges visual-textual granularity gaps via hyperbolic transformations, yielding consistent improvements on benchmarks while adding minimal parameters.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

TL;DR: AnyPcc通过通用上下文模型+实例自适应微调，有效提升点云几何压缩的泛化与对OOD数据的处理，15个数据集上达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习点云压缩方法泛化能力弱，主要由于上下文模型不鲁棒与对分布外数据处理不当，AnyPcc旨在通过更强的上下文建模与实例级自适应微调来提升泛化与效率。

Method: 1) 统一上下文模型：利用空间与通道分组先验，构建鲁棒的上下文依赖建模；2) 实例自适应微调（IAFT）：对每个实例微调部分网络权重并把权重编码进比特流，结合显式与隐式压缩范式以应对OOD样本。

Result: AnyPcc提出了一种通用的点云几何压缩框架，通过引入统一上下文模型和实例自适应微调（IAFT）来增强泛化能力与处理OOD数据的效率。统一上下文模型结合空间与通道分组的先验，以捕捉稳健的上下文依赖；IAFT对每个实例微调少量网络权重并将其一并编码进比特流，从而以较小的权重开销换取显著的压缩收益。实验证明在15个异构数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，代码与数据集将开源。

Conclusion: AnyPcc同时解决了上下文建模不足与OOD数据处理低效的问题，通过少量权重微调并编码到比特流中，实现了更好的压缩性能与泛化能力，且在大量数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AccuQuant is a PTQ method that explicitly simulates and minimizes accumulated quantization errors over multiple denoising steps, using an efficient O(1) memory objective, yielding better quantized diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization errors accumulate over multiple denoising steps during diffusion sampling, degrading output quality; existing PTQ methods minimize per-step discrepancies independently and ignore accumulation.

Method: Post-training quantization for diffusion models

Result: AccuQuant simulates multiple denoising steps during quantization and minimizes multi-step discrepancies, with an efficient implementation and novel objective reducing memory from O(n) to O(1); demonstrates improved performance across tasks and models.

Conclusion: Simulating multiple denoising steps for quantization and optimizing accumulated discrepancies effectively mitigates error accumulation, enabling efficient and accurate post-training quantization of diffusion models.

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

Motivation: Understand how positional encodings influence spatial coherence in DiTs and extend PEs to 3D to enable geometry modeling and fine control

Method: Paper analysis

Result: Introduces PE-Field, a 3D structured positional encoding with depth-aware and hierarchical encodings; achieves SOTA on single-image novel view synthesis and enables controllable spatial editing

Conclusion: PE-Field lets DiTs model 3D geometry and sub-patch details, improving novel view synthesis and enabling spatially controllable edits

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 针对图像无法捕捉菜谱中非视觉关键信息的问题，本文用因果建模预测并注入被忽视的烹饪要素，显著提升了单语和多语多文化数据集上的图像—菜谱检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像无法完整反映菜谱中的关键信息（如食材的细微差异和烹饪步骤），导致跨模态检索偏向显著的视觉元素，难以区分具有细微差别的相似菜谱；源自不同文化的混合训练数据会加剧这种偏差。

Method: 通过构建因果模型来识别图像-菜谱模态差距中被忽略的烹饪要素，设计预测模块将这些要素注入跨模态表示学习管道，并在单语与多语多文化数据集上进行验证。

Result: 提出一种因果方法，预测图像中可能被忽视的烹饪要素（如微小食材和烹饪动作），并将这些要素显式注入到跨模态表示学习中，从而减轻表示偏差。

Conclusion: 因果表示学习能够发现图像未展示的细微食材与烹饪动作，缓解视觉主导的表示偏差，在单语Recipe1M和新构建的多语多文化数据集上均取得了优异的检索效果。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

Motivation: Address uncertainty and complexity in lung cancer image diagnosis by dynamically adjusting knowledge distillation weights with fuzzy logic so student focuses on high-confidence regions and ignores ambiguous areas.

Method: FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet

Result: High accuracy across datasets: 99.16% on LC25000 histopathology and 99.54% on IQOTH/NCCD CT-scans; improved generalization via ViT->MobileNet KD, image fusion preprocessing, GA-based student selection, and dynamic wait adjustment for training.

Conclusion: 结合动态模糊KD、图像融合与GA模型选择的方法能在不同肺癌影像域上实现高精度、鲁棒的分类，同时兼顾计算效率。

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

Result: 在六个多步推理基准上，Conan平均较Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct提升10%+准确率，且在长视频理解任务中表现出良好可扩展性与鲁棒性，达到了SOTA水平。

Conclusion: Conan有效解决了现有方法中推理脱节与证据定位不准的问题，通过证据标识、跨帧推理和自适应行动决策的协同训练，在多步视频推理与长视频理解上取得了SOTA性能与强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出模块化迁移学习的DAI流水线，结合人脸识别编码器与非线性分类头，并引入基于身份内一致性的鲁棒性指标，在性别与族裔推断上优于基线，强调可复现性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公平性审计依赖于自动化的人口统计属性推断，但传统端到端DAI不可靠，会导致偏差和高方差的公平性估计；提高DAI可靠性能降低审计偏差与不确定性，从而更可信地评估FAS的公平性。

Method: 用预训练人脸识别模型提取特征，冻结或微调编码器，并在其上训练非线性分类头；评估维度包括准确率、公平性（可能是误差差异等）与新提出的基于身份内一致性的鲁棒性指标；在多数据集上对性别与族裔进行基准测试。

Result: The paper presents a reproducible modular pipeline for demographic attribute inference (DAI) to improve fairness auditing in face analysis systems (FAS). It replaces end-to-end training with transfer learning using pretrained face recognition encoders and non-linear classification heads, and introduces a robustness metric based on intra-identity consistency. Benchmarks on gender and ethnicity show better accuracy and fairness, especially for ethnicity; authors will release data, code, models, and tools.

Conclusion: 模块化迁移学习能提高DAI的准确性、公平性及鲁棒性，从而为FAS公平性审计提供更可靠的基础；特别在族裔推断上改进明显。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

*Yixiong Yang,Tao Wu,Senmao Li,Shiqi Yang,Yaxing Wang,Joost van de Weijer,Kai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EchoDistill：教师-学生双向蒸馏并共享文本编码器，学生用对抗与对齐损失优化，并反向回传以提升教师，显著提升一步个性化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有一步T2I扩散模型难以拟合新概念分布，限制了个性化能力；通过利用多步教师的表达力与一步学生的快速生成能力互补，能实现高效且高质量的个性化。

Method: 同时端到端训练教师（多步）与学生（一步）；共享文本编码器；先从教师向学生蒸馏概念，再由学生回传给教师；学生使用对抗损失对齐真实图像分布，并使用对齐损失保持与教师输出的一致性；采用双向回声细化策略让学生快速生成结果反馈教师。

Result: EchoDistill提出了一种双向概念蒸馏框架，用于实现一步扩散模型的个性化（1-SDP），通过同时训练多步教师模型和一步学生模型，并在两者之间共享文本编码器，学生通过对抗损失和对齐损失进行优化，同时学生生成能力反馈到教师以提升双方性能。

Conclusion: 双向回声蒸馏在1-SDP场景下既能提升一步模型的个性化能力，也能改善教师模型的生成质量，优于现有个性化方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: address trade-off between powerful multi-step reasoning and general capability inefficiency

Method: 将Qwen2.5-VL-7B改造成MoE架构，设计轻量可训练路由器以动态分配查询到思考或非思考专家，评估复杂推理和通用任务性能

Result: Metis-HOME: MoE with thinking and non-thinking experts plus trainable router, improves reasoning and general performance instantiated on Qwen2.5-VL-7B

Conclusion: Metis-HOME能同时提升复杂推理与一般理解能力，解决了推理专化导致的一般能力退化问题，提出混合思维范式

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

TL;DR: 提出通过人脸概念树与细粒度伪造掩码结合文本解释的FiFa框架与FiFa-MLLM模型，改善现有XDFA方法的可解释性与区域感知，达到更可靠的伪造证据定位与解释生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XDFA方法缺乏细粒度区域感知与文本-视觉证据对齐，注释粗糙且模型不能处理任意人脸区域查询，导致解释不具备充分的Face Visual Context（Facext）。

Method: 构建人脸图像概念树(FICT)划分区域；开发FiFa-Annotator进行细粒度伪造注释；定义Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，结合文本与分割掩码输出；设计FiFa-MLLM多任务架构，加入辅助监督任务训练以提高分割与解释质量。

Result: 提出FiFa框架，包含细粒度人脸区域概念树(FICT)和注释工具FiFa-Annotator；定义AGE任务，输出文本解释并插入伪造区域分割掩码；设计统一多任务FiFa-MLLM模型，支持丰富多模态输入输出并借助辅助任务提升性能；在AGE任务和现有XDFA数据集上取得优于强基线和SOTA表现，计划开源代码数据。

Conclusion: FiFa通过精细的人脸区域划分与多任务学习，使MLLM在伪造解释输出中实现文本与视觉证据的对齐（AGE任务），显著提升了解释的可靠性和定位能力，且在基准上优于现有方法。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

Motivation: The paper addresses motion blur from camera shake, especially large/rotational motion, aiming to jointly estimate sharp image and camera motion trajectory from single blurry image.

Method: 采用可微投影运动模糊模块实现PMBM；神经网络预测完整3D旋转轨迹；基于该轨迹的模型驱动恢复网络端到端训练；推理后通过重模糊损失对轨迹进行优化以提升一致性。

Result: They implement PMBM via a differentiable blur module; a network predicts 3D rotation trajectory guiding a model-based restoration network; trajectory allows reconstructing sharp image sequence and is refined via post-inference reblur loss; achieves SOTA on synthetic and real datasets, especially for severe/spatially variant blur.

Conclusion: 通过将可解释的运动轨迹估计与基于模型的去模糊网络结合，并用重模糊一致性优化，方法在复杂模糊情况下优于纯端到端方法，并能重建生成该模糊的清晰序列。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM在低纹理、快速运动和复杂光照条件下性能下降，影响对视觉障碍者等应用场景中导航的可靠性和安全性，亟需提升特征匹配鲁棒性以保证定位与跟踪稳定。

Method: 将SuperPoint用于密集、学习驱动的特征检测与描述符生成，利用LightGlue进行强健的特征匹配，并将这些模块集成到基于ORB-SLAM3的框架中替换传统的ORB特征与匹配器；在TUM RGB-D、ICL-NUIM与TartanAir等数据集上进行了定量评估。

Result: 在所选数据集与挑战场景下，SELM-SLAM3相比ORB-SLAM3平均提高87.84%，并超越当前RGB-D最先进系统36.77%，在低纹理与快速运动场景中表现尤为显著。

Conclusion: SELM-SLAM3通过结合SuperPoint与LightGlue提升了特征提取与匹配的鲁棒性，从而在低纹理、运动模糊和复杂光照等挑战场景中显著改进了视觉SLAM的定位精度与跟踪稳定性。

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging
conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an
open challenge. Such conditions are common in applications such as assistive
navigation for the visually impaired. These challenges undermine localization
accuracy and tracking stability, reducing navigation reliability and safety. To
overcome these limitations, we present SELM-SLAM3, a deep learning-enhanced
visual SLAM framework that integrates SuperPoint and LightGlue for robust
feature extraction and matching. We evaluated our framework using TUM RGB-D,
ICL-NUIM, and TartanAir datasets, which feature diverse and challenging
scenarios. SELM-SLAM3 outperforms conventional ORB-SLAM3 by an average of
87.84% and exceeds state-of-the-art RGB-D SLAM systems by 36.77%. Our framework

Motivation: Consumer cameras fail under challenging illumination causing exposure, color, and tonal issues harming downstream tasks; need scene-adaptive, real-time solution for edge devices

Method: Predictive camera parameter adjustment via lightweight neural network

Result: ACamera-Net with two modules (ACamera-Exposure predicts ISO; ACamera-Color predicts color temperature and gains) improves image quality and perception stability, generalizes across lighting, outperforms auto modes and lightweight baselines

Conclusion: ACamera-Net是可部署于边缘的有效方案，通过双模块设计在不同光照下稳定提升曝光与色彩一致性，改善下游视觉任务表现

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model

For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging

achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new

<details>

Motivation: Extend evidence-centered image reasoning (OpenAI-o3) to video domain by integrating spatio-temporal evidence into video reasoning, addressing joint temporal tracking and spatial localization challenges.

Method: Curate two spatio-temporal datasets (STGR-CoT-30k for SFT, STGR-RL-36k for RL); train with cold-start reinforcement learning using rewards for answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision; model outputs answers plus timestamps, object IDs, and bounding boxes; evaluate on multiple benchmarks.

Result: Open-o3 Video model that outputs timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes with answers; two datasets STGR-CoT-30k and STGR-RL-36k for SFT and RL; cold-start RL with multiple rewards; SOTA on V-STAR and improvements on other benchmarks; enables confidence-aware verification.

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video successfully grounds video reasoning in explicit spatio-temporal evidence, improving accuracy and reliability across benchmarks and enabling test-time confidence-aware verification.

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在细粒度颜色控制上表现欠佳，且现有基准未系统评估颜色精确性；颜色对视觉与设计工作至关重要，需可量化的评估以推动模型改进。

Result: 使用GenColorBench对主流模型评测发现：模型在常见命名颜色（CSS3/X11）上表现较好，但对ISCC-NBS分级语义和数值RGB解析能力较弱；存在提示理解、色域限制和渲染偏差等主要失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench是首个专注文本到图像颜色控制的综合基准，能发现现有模型在颜色精确性上的局限，揭示不同模型对颜色体系（ISCC-NBS、CSS3/X11、数值RGB）的理解差异，并通过感知与自动评估指示改进方向。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出针对跨模态（领域）分割的新框架：在嵌入空间学习类级原型，并用相似性约束使原型对类内代表且类间可分；用字典保存不同图像的原型以避免类丢失并支持原型对比学习，从而提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在训练集外的未见域上性能急剧下降，跨模态分割需减少域差异并避免对新域标注的高成本；通过学习可区分且具代表性的类级原型可增强泛化与鲁棒性。

Method: 在嵌入空间为每个语义类学习原型（prototype）；引入相似性约束（使原型与同类特征相似、与异类区别）并用字典（存储来自不同图像的原型）避免某些类在单图像中缺失，同时对原型进行对比学习以加强可分性和代表性。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提方法在跨模态分割任务上优于其他最先进方法，实验性能提升明显。

Conclusion: 通过相似性约束与原型字典的设计，所提方法在跨模态分割任务上优于现有最先进方法，提升了模型在未见域上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

### [62] [OnlineSplatter: Pose-Free Online 3D Reconstruction for Free-Moving Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20605)
*Mark He Huang,Lin Geng Foo,Christian Theobalt,Ying Sun,De Wen Soh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OnlineSplatter is an online feed-forward method that reconstructs free-moving objects from monocular video into 3D Gaussian primitives without pose/depth priors, using a dual-key memory for robust temporal fusion, achieving better quality than pose-free baselines with constant computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstruct free-moving objects from monocular video without camera pose, depth priors, or bundle adjustment; enable online, constant-cost processing with high-quality object-centric 3D Gaussian models.

Method: analysis of OnlineSplatter

Result: OnlineSplatter produces dense 3D Gaussian primitive fields anchored by first frame, uses dual-key memory (latent appearance-geometry keys + explicit directional keys) for temporal fusion, spatial-guided readout and sparsification; outperforms pose-free baselines on real-world datasets, improves with more observations while keeping constant memory and runtime.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-key memory and sparsification enable efficient, scalable, and accurate online object-centric reconstruction from monocular video, removing need for pose/depth supervision and maintaining constant resource usage as more frames are processed.

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.

### [63] [SeViCES: Unifying Semantic-Visual Evidence Consensus for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20622)
*Yuan Sheng,Yanbin Hao,Chenxu Li,Shuo Wang,Xiangnan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个训练无关、模型无关的证据选择框架SeViCES，用于长视频理解。通过语义-视觉共识来选择关键帧：语义分支基于LLM对字幕/描述进行时间感知推理，视觉分支通过聚类和互信息将视觉嵌入与语义分数对齐；随后通过答案共识细化融合并约束答案空间以解决不一致。实验在长视频基准上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频信息复杂且分散，直接用Video-LLMs代价高且易导致推理不集中或不一致，选择最有信息的帧能高效且准确地支持下游问答，但现有方法忽视时间依赖或仅用单一模态证据，导致背景缺失或答案不完整。

Method: 引入SVCFS模块：1）时间感知语义分支——对视频字幕/描述利用LLM进行逐帧/段落推理得到语义重要性评分，2）聚类引导视觉分支——对帧的视觉嵌入进行聚类并通过互信息优化使视觉评分与语义评分对齐；再引入ACR模块——对语义与视觉预测进行融合，通过约束答案空间和共识机制解决预测冲突并细化最终回答。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准上，SeViCES在准确率和鲁棒性上持续超越最先进方法，证明共识驱动的证据选择对Video-LLMs重要。

Conclusion: SeViCES通过语义-视觉共识的证据选择显著提升了Video-LLMs在长视频理解任务上的准确性和鲁棒性，且框架无需训练、对模型无特殊依赖。

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

*Ibrahim Ethem Hamamci,Sezgin Er,Suprosanna Shit,Hadrien Reynaud,Dong Yang,Pengfei Guo,Marc Edgar,Daguang Xu,Bernhard Kainz,Bjoern Menze*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BTB3D，一种因果卷积编码-解码器，生成频率感知的体积tokens，通过三阶段训练（局部重建、重叠窗口切片、长上下文解码）实现从短切片片段泛化到超300层的CT体积，无需额外内存。显著提升报告生成（BLEU与临床F1↑40%）和文本到CT合成（FID↓75%，FVD减半），产出512×512×241的解剖一致体积。强调精确三维token化比仅扩大型语言模型更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在高分辨率、长序列CT体积上表现受限：对比预训练导致视觉编码器与临床语言错配，按切片token化模糊精细解剖结构，降低下游诊断性能。因此需要更好的三维token化方法以扩展可解释和可伸缩的视觉-语言模型。

Method: 提出因果卷积编码器-解码器，联合2D/3D训练与推理，生成紧致的频率感知体积tokens；采用三阶段训练课程：1) 局部重建，2) 重叠窗口切片训练，3) 长上下文解码器精炼，使模型从短片段学习并推广到超长体积。

Result: 在报告生成任务上，BTB3D在BLEU分数和临床F1上较CT2Rep、CT-CHAT、Merlin提升约40%；在文本到CT合成上相较GenerateCT和MedSyn将FID降低75%、FVD减半，生成512×512×241的解剖一致体积。代码已开源。

Conclusion: 精确的三维token化与三阶段训练策略是提升3D医学影像视觉-语言建模的关键，BTB3D在报告生成与文本条件CT合成上显著优于现有方法，证明了token表示的重要性。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 构建了100K张高质量超高分辨率图像数据集，并通过细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则(SWFR)在频域约束高频细节，显著提升UHR生成细节与保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UHR T2I缺少大规模高质量数据集且训练策略未专门针对UHR细节合成，导致模型难以生成细致丰富的超高分辨率图像。

Method: 1) 构建高质量100K UHR图像数据集，每张>3K分辨率并配丰富描述；2) 设计DOTS：重点采样对细节关键的去噪时间步；3) 设计SWFR：在频域使用DFT对不同频率分量进行软约束，促进高频细节保留；4) 在已有T2I扩散模型上做后训练并在UltraHR-eval4K上评估。

Result: 提出了UltraHR-100K数据集和频谱感知的后训练方法以提升UHR图像的细节生成。

Conclusion: UltraHR-100K与频谱感知后训练方法能有效改善UHR文本到图像生成的细节表现，实验在UltraHR-eval4K上展示了明显提升。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Result: A hybrid model combining ResNet-152 backbone, Differentiable Soft-SOM for topological clustering, and a spiking neural head achieved 97.39% test accuracy on a ten-class waste dataset, outperforming several SOTA models while being lightweight.

Conclusion: 该框架在准确率、可解释性与能效之间取得平衡，可用于实际垃圾分拣系统，减少填埋与污染，推动城市可持续发展。

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过权重偏置校正与比特级核心集采样，显著减少多精度量化训练成本，保留或提升性能，训练加速最多7.88倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多比特量化方法对每个支持的位宽都需全数据集训练并常需额外微调，导致训练成本随精度数量线性增长，需要降低训练开销同时保持模型实用性。

Method: (1) 权重偏置校正：校正量化引起的偏置以对齐不同位宽的激活分布，从而共享BN并避免额外微调；(2) 比特级核心集采样：为每个子模型选择基于梯度重要性的紧凑训练子集，实现隐式知识迁移并减少重复训练。

Result: 提出了两种降低多比特量化网络训练开销的方法：权重偏置校正（共享BN，无需微调）和按位核心集采样（基于梯度的重要性选择小样本），在多数据集和模型上实现了与或优于基线的精度，同时最大加速可达7.88x。

Conclusion: 方法有效降低训练时间和微调需求，在CIFAR/TinyImageNet/ImageNet及ResNet/ViT上验证，性能与效率兼得。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at
https://github.com/a2jinhee/EMQNet_jk.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation
suite to facilitate future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MixKV方法，在多模态大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）中结合重要性与多样性，按注意力头自适应压缩KV缓存以减少冗余，提升在极端压缩下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩只基于重要性，忽视不同模态和注意力头中存在的语义冗余模式，导致语义覆盖不足。

Method: 对KV缓存按注意力头分析语义冗余，基于重要性与多样性设计混合选择策略：为每个头自适应分配重要性与多样性权重，并在压缩时优先保留既重要又能覆盖语义多样性的KV对。

Result: 在压缩预算为64的极端设置下，MixKV相比基线平均提升5.1%，在GUI grounding任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别提升8.0%和9.0%，并在保持推理效率同时对LLM也能应用取得相似增益。

Conclusion: MixKV在保留语义覆盖的同时，通过在注意力头级别平衡重要性与多样性显著提升KV缓存压缩效果，实验证明在多模态理解和GUI定位任务上均优于现有方法，且可扩展到纯LLM。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将点云投影为二维深度图的方法存在几何不一致性，导致信息不可逆丢失，限制高精度遥感应用；迫切需要一种通用、无厂商依赖的无损投影方法。

Method: 通过自动反推传感器内参（激光束配置、角度分布及每束校正项），构建投影映射并恢复点云；算法对每帧点云估计并校正畸变，保证双向一一映射，实时执行。

Result: 在KITTI与DurLAR数据集上实现了完美点保留（零点丢失），几何误差在传感器精度范围内，实时性能良好；在压缩等下游任务上显示显著质量提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出ALICE-LRI，一种无需厂商元数据即可从旋转式LiDAR点云恢复无损二维深度图的方法，实现了零点丢失的可逆投影。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: AutoScape能生成超过20秒的真实且几何一致的驾驶视频，在长时域生成质量（FID、FVD）上分别提升48.6%和43.0%，表明其在保持几何一致性和视觉连贯性方面显著优于先前方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyPE is a training-free method that modifies positional encodings during diffusion, exploiting spectral progression to enable ultra-high-resolution image generation from pre-trained diffusion transformers with no extra sampling cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce cost and enable pre-trained diffusion transformers to generate images at much higher resolutions than trained, by addressing positional encoding mismatch across diffusion steps via a training-free method.

Method: Dynamic Position Extrapolation (DyPE)

Result: DyPE dynamically adjusts positional encodings per diffusion step to match frequency spectrum of generative process, allowing dramatic resolution extrapolation (e.g., 16M pixels with FLUX) and improving fidelity especially at higher resolutions, achieving SOTA on benchmarks.

Conclusion: DyPE enables pre-trained diffusion transformers to synthesize images far beyond training resolutions by dynamically matching positional encoding frequency to diffusion stages, yielding state-of-the-art fidelity that scales with resolution.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

Motivation: 解析MeanFlow训练不稳定与收敛慢的原因，找到目标函数分解后产生的优化冲突

Method: 分析方法与贡献

Result: 提出α-Flow，通过从trajectory flow matching到MeanFlow的课程学习消除冲突，提升收敛，并在ImageNet-1K上取得更好FID，最大模型FID 2.58 (1-NFE) & 2.15 (2-NFE)

Conclusion: α-Flow通过分解目标并采用渐进策略改善优化，实证展示在大规模图像生成任务上比MeanFlow更优。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

TL;DR: Cupid通过两阶段流匹配的生成式方法，从单张图像联合生成体素与像素-体素对应，能同时恢复精确位姿、细化形状与纹理，显著优于现有重建方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张图像精确重建物体的位姿、形状和纹理问题，弥补判别式单视图估计在细节和不确定性建模上的不足，通过生成式建模更好地表达多解性和外观多样性。

Method: 引入共享的3D潜在空间并采用两阶段流匹配管线：第一阶段粗略生成初始3D几何及其2D投影以恢复位姿；第二阶段将位姿对齐的图像特征融入以细化结构和外观细节。模型同时生成体素和像素-体素对应，提高了位姿和形状估计的鲁棒性。

Result: 在大量实验中，Cupid在PSNR上超过现有主流重建方法3+dB，Chamfer Distance降低超过10%，位姿估计与单目估计器相当，并在视觉保真度上优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid提出了一个统一的生成框架，通过条件采样从学习到的3D对象分布中联合生成体素和像素-体素对应关系，实现从单张图像精确推断相机位姿、3D形状和纹理。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Motivation: 使用雷达与相机数据融合提高多目标跟踪（MOT）的效率并减少人工干预，通过在线校准和共享特征实现传感器之间的自主关联。

Method: 构建雷达-相机融合框架：1) 在线估计雷达到相机的映射矩阵以实现坐标对齐；2) 提取并匹配雷达和相机间的共有特征（如类别信息与几何特征）以确定关联；3) 结合位置信息、特征匹配得分与类别一致性进行数据关联；4) 在受控和真实交通场景中进行实测评估。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了雷达与相机检测结果的无缝整合，通过在线校准和共享特征显著提升了多目标跟踪的准确性与自动化程度，为传感器融合MOT提供了新的思路与实现参考。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将图像分割接入MLLM的方法依赖离散边界点或任务专用分割头，难以捕捉细粒度视觉信息且依赖语义提示或任务特定解码器。

Method: 利用MLLM自回归生成视觉tokens，并采用next-scale-prediction策略并行生成所需tokens以降低推理延迟；最终通过通用VQ-VAE将tokens解码为图像化的分割掩码。

Result: 在多个分割数据集上超越此前SOTA，同时显著提升推理速度并保持强大的多模态理解能力。

Conclusion: ARGenSeg提出将分割任务视为图像生成问题，通过MLLM直接生成视觉tokens并经通用VQ-VAE解码得到像素级掩码，从而增强模型对细粒度视觉细节的建模能力。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple
segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while
maintaining strong understanding capabilities.

Motivation: 受自回归大型语言模型在性能和可扩展性上的启发，希望将Transformer成功地移植到视频预测领域，特别是解决现有视频生成方法在物理仿真因果建模上的短板，旨在提高长期物理准确性并增强可解释性。

Method: 比较多种时空自注意力布局，采用端到端纯Transformer架构进行自回归视频生成，直接在像素空间建模，无需隐空间或特征学习模块。并通过无监督训练在物理仿真数据集上评估。

Result: 相比现有潜空间方法，在物理准确性方面可以将可预测时间窗延长最多50%，视频质量指标相当，同时通过可解释性探查发现网络中部分区域编码了与偏微分方程(PDE)仿真参数估计相关的信息，并且这种编码可泛化到分布外参数。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种简单纯粹的Transformer自回归视频预测模型，在连续像素空间上进行预测，无需复杂的潜变量学习或训练策略，显著延长了物理仿真预测的时间范围，兼顾视频质量指标并具备可解释性。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

Motivation: 现有大型VLM在处理信息密集且标注密集的高分辨率图像（如信息图、图表）时，难以精确定位重要线索并进行多跳推理。提出无需训练的组合策略以利用多模型互补性提高准确性并节省计算资源。

Method: 采用草稿-裁决(两阶段)流程：多个小型VLM作为草稿专家并行生成多样化定位与推理路径；通过共识机制筛选高一致性路径；由大VLM作为裁决者融合这些路径生成最终答案。该框架受推测式解码启发，强调低计算成本下的结果合成。

Result: 在InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K等高难度数据集上，SV在准确性和效率上均有稳定提升，能够在保持较低计算开销的同时纠正部分错误并恢复正确答案。

Conclusion: SV是一个不需训练、结合多小型草稿专家与强大裁决模型的两阶段推理框架，通过合成来自多个草稿推理路径的共识来纠错并提升信息密集图像问答性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

TL;DR: Introduce SpectraMorph: an interpretable, physics-guided self-supervised HSI-MSI fusion using unmixing bottleneck—fast, robust, and effective even with pan-chromatic MSI


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSI has low spatial resolution; MSI/RGB/PAN provide high-res spatial detail but few bands; existing deep methods lack interpretability and fail with very few MSI bands

Method: Physics-guided self-supervised fusion with unmixing bottleneck

Result: SpectraMorph extracts endmembers from LR-HSI, predicts abundance-like maps from MSI via compact MLP, reconstructs spectra by linear mixing, trains self-supervised using MSI spectral response; produces interpretable intermediates, trains quickly, robust even with single-band MSI; outperforms unsupervised/self-supervised baselines and competitive with supervised ones

Conclusion: SpectraMorph offers fast, interpretable, and robust hyperspectral super-resolution via endmember unmixing and self-supervised training, achieving state-of-the-art among unsupervised methods and competitive supervised performance

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型在空间构图交互控制和多主体扩展性方面存在不足，难以自由放置、调整、锁定多个对象且避免遮挡问题。LayerComposer 提出一种交互式的个性化多主体文本到图像生成框架，旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 引入分层画布表示，每个主体占一层；设计锁定机制，利用固有位置嵌入与新互补数据采样策略实现对被锁层的高保真保持，同时允许未锁层根据上下文自由生成；用户通过图层操作实现放置、缩放、锁定。

Result: 提出了 layered canvas（分层画布）和 locking mechanism（锁定机制）。分层画布将每个主体放在独立图层上，实现无遮挡组合；锁定机制在不改模型架构的前提下，通过位置嵌入和新的数据采样策略高保真地锁定选定图层，同时允许其他图层灵活适应上下文。实验证明在空间控制和身份保真方面优于现有多主体个性化生成方法。

Conclusion: LayerComposer 为个性化多主体文本到图像生成提供了直观的图层级交互操作（放置/缩放/锁定），并通过位置嵌入结合数据采样实现架构无关的高保真锁定，显著提升了空间控制与身份保真。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

Result: 提出HoloCine模型，通过窗口交叉注意力和稀疏跨镜自注意力实现长叙事一致性

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 云计算、海量数据和统一数据平台的兴起暴露了传统查询优化器在鲁棒性、跨引擎协作和全局性能优化方面的不足，迫切需要新方向来满足现代生产系统需求。

Method: 通过工业视角的回顾与需求分析，论文归纳现有系统的局限，讨论三条发展趋势，并举例说明如何在生产系统中应用这些趋势来改进查询优化器设计。

Result: 论文总结并阐释了三大行业趋势的潜在影响与实施方向，提出未来研究和工程实践的路线图，以促进查询优化器从单片设计向更加动态和可组合的架构转变。

Conclusion: 结合更紧密的执行反馈、工作负载级优化和可组合架构，查询优化将在鲁棒性、全局性能和系统灵活性上显著提升，推动向动态、整体和可适应的优化实践演进。

Abstract: For nearly half a century, the core design of query optimizers in industrial
database systems has remained remarkably stable, relying on foundational
principles from System R and the Volcano/Cascades framework. However, the rise
of cloud computing, massive data volumes, and unified data platforms has
exposed the limitations of this traditional, monolithic architecture. Taking an
industrial perspective, this paper reviews the past and present of query
optimization in production systems and identifies the challenges they face
today. Then this paper highlights three key trends gaining momentum in the
industry that promise to address these challenges. First, a tighter feedback
loop between query optimization and query execution is being used to improve
the robustness of query performance. Second, the scope of optimization is
expanding from a single query to entire workloads through the convergence of
query optimization and workload optimization. Third, and perhaps most
transformatively, the industry is moving from monolithic designs to composable
architectures that foster agility and cross-engine collaboration. Together,
these trends chart a clear path toward a more dynamic, holistic, and adaptable

Motivation: 现有增强方法分为结构导向（针对特定索引，静态场景效果好，动态场景弱）和布局导向（通用性好，动态场景表现好但静态场景欠佳），缺乏一种既能在静态场景下获得高性能又能在动态场景下保持稳定的统一方法。

Method: 提出UREM方法，通过对索引布局进行优化（静态场景下整体优化，动态场景下局部重组），实现统一适配多种索引。具体包括布局分析、改造策略以及部分重组机制以应对查询模式变化。对20种常用索引在多平台上进行评估。

Result: 在20种常用索引上，UREM在静态负载下分别最高提升多维索引5.73x和高维索引9.18x；在动态负载下平均提升5.72x和9.47x；部分传统索引经增强后性能可比或优于新型先进索引。

Conclusion: UREM能统一适配不同索引与平台，通过布局优化在静态负载下显著提升查询性能，并通过部分布局重组在动态负载下稳定性能。经实验证明，UREM在多维和高维索引上均能获得显著提升，并能让一些传统索引达到或超过先进索引的性能。

Abstract: Numerous multi- or high-dimensional indexes with distinct advantages have
been proposed on various platforms to meet application requirements. To achieve
higher-performance queries, most indexes employ enhancement methods, including
structure-oriented and layout-oriented enhancement methods. Existing
structure-oriented methods tailored to specific indexes work well under static
workloads but lack generality and degrade under dynamic workloads. The
layout-oriented methods exhibit good generality and perform well under dynamic
workloads, but exhibit suboptimal performance under static workloads.
Therefore, it is an open challenge to develop a unified and resilient
enhancement method that can improve query performance for different indexes
adaptively under different scenarios. In this paper, we propose UREM, which is
the first high-performance Unified and Resilient Enhancement Method designed
for both multi- and high-dimensional indexes, capable of adapting to different
scenarios. Specifically, UREM (1) can be uniformly applied with different
indexes on various platforms; (2) enhances the query performance of indexes by
layout optimization under static workloads; (3) enables indexes to stabilize
performance when queries shift through partial layout reorganization. We
evaluate UREM on 20 widely used indexes. Experimental results demonstrate that
UREM improves the query performance of multi- and high-dimensional indexes by
up to 5.73x and 9.18x under static workloads, and by an average of 5.72x and
9.47x under dynamic workloads. Moreover, some traditional indexes enhanced by
UREM even achieve performance comparable to or even surpassing that of recent
advanced indexes.

Result: 总结贡献和结果

Conclusion: 结论

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as one of the most prominent
applications of vector databases. By integrating documents retrieved from a
database into the prompt of a large language model (LLM), RAG enables more
reliable and informative content generation. While there has been extensive
research on vector databases, many open research problems remain once they are
considered in the wider context of end-to-end RAG pipelines. One practical yet
challenging problem is how to jointly optimize both system performance and
generation quality in RAG, which is significantly more complex than it appears
due to the numerous knobs on both the algorithmic side (spanning models and
databases) and the systems side (from software to hardware). In this paper, we
present RAG-Stack, a three-pillar blueprint for quality-performance
co-optimization in RAG systems. RAG-Stack comprises: (1) RAG-IR, an
intermediate representation that serves as an abstraction layer to decouple
quality and performance aspects; (2) RAG-CM, a cost model for estimating system
performance given an RAG-IR; and (3) RAG-PE, a plan exploration algorithm that
searches for high-quality, high-performance RAG configurations. We believe this
three-pillar blueprint will become the de facto paradigm for RAG
quality-performance co-optimization in the years to come.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出基于MILP的新模型和混合框架用于联接排序，能优化任意bushy树并在大规模查询（最多100表）上获得稳健优质执行计划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods either can't scale to large queries or have degrading/poor worst-case quality; need robust, scalable optimiser for large/bushy joins

Method: mixed integer linear programming (MILP) for join ordering

Result: Novel MILP model for arbitrary bushy trees embedded in a hybrid framework; scales to 100 relations and yields robust plan quality outperforming competitors

Conclusion: MILP+混合框架有效解决大规模联接排序问题，在可扩展性和计划质量上优于现有启发式与纯MILP方法。

Abstract: Finding optimal join orders is among the most crucial steps to be performed
by query optimisers. Though extensively studied in data management research,
the problem remains far from solved: While query optimisers rely on exhaustive
search methods to determine ideal solutions for small problems, such methods
reach their limits once queries grow in size. Yet, large queries become
increasingly common in real-world scenarios, and require suitable methods to
generate efficient execution plans. While a variety of heuristics have been
proposed for large-scale query optimisation, they suffer from degrading
solution quality as queries grow in size, or feature highly sub-optimal
worst-case behavior, as we will show.
  We propose a novel method based on the paradigm of mixed integer linear
programming (MILP): By deriving a novel MILP model capable of optimising
arbitrary bushy tree structures, we address the limitations of existing MILP
methods for join ordering, and can rely on highly optimised MILP solvers to
derive efficient tree structures that elude competing methods. To ensure
optimisation efficiency, we embed our MILP method into a hybrid framework,
which applies MILP solvers precisely where they provide the greatest advantage
over competitors, while relying on more efficient methods for less complex
optimisation steps. Thereby, our approach gracefully scales to extremely large
query sizes joining up to 100 relations, and consistently achieves the most
robust plan quality among a large variety of competing join ordering methods.

Abstract: Microservices architectures are an integral part of modern software
development. Their adoption brings significant changes to database management.
Instead of relying on a single database, a microservices architecture is
typically composed of multiple, smaller, heterogeneous, and distributed DBs. In
these data-intensive systems, the variety and combination of database
categories and technologies play a crucial role in storing and managing data.
While data management in microservices is a major challenge, research
literature is scarce.
  We present an empirical study on how databases are used in microservices. On
the dataset we collected (and released as open data for future research),
considering 15 years of microservices, we examine ca. 1,000 GitHub projects
that use databases selected among 180 technologies from 14 categories. We
perform a comprehensive analysis of current practices, providing researchers
and practitioners with empirical evidence to better understand database usage
in microservices. We report 18 findings and 9 recommendations. We show that
microservices predominantly use Relational, Key-Value, Document, and Search
databases. Notably, 52% of microservices combine multiple database categories.
Complexity correlates with database count, with older systems favoring
Relational databases and newer ones increasingly adopting Key-Value and
Document technologies. Niche databases (e.g., EventStoreDB, PostGIS), while not
widespread, are often combined with a mainstream one.

TL;DR: 研究多产品广告牌插播选择问题：在预算和影响差距约束下最大化总影响，证明NP难，提出LP松弛+随机四舍五入和贪心平衡启发式，实证优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Advertisers want to select limited billboard slots for multiple products to maximize aggregated influence while keeping influence balanced across products and within per-product budgets.

Method: LP relaxation + greedy balance heuristic

Result: Prove NP-hardness; formulate ILP/LP relaxation with randomized rounding; propose greedy heuristic with balance correction; experiments on real trajectory and billboard data show better influence than baselines.

Conclusion: 所提方法在保证预算和影响平衡约束下，能实质提升总影响，且贪心启发式在效率和效果上表现良好。

Abstract: The billboard advertisement has emerged as an effective out-of-home
advertisement technique where the objective is to choose a limited number of
slots to play some advertisement content (e.g., animation, video, etc.) with
the hope that the content will be visible to a large number of travelers, and
this will be helpful to earn more revenue. In this paper, we study a variant of
the influential slot selection problem where the advertiser wants to promote
multiple products. Formally, we call this problem the \textsc{Multi-Product
Influence Maximization Problem for the Balanced Popularity} Problem. The input
to our problem is a trajectory and a billboard database, as well as a budget
for each product. The goal here is to choose a subset of slots for each product
such that the aggregated influence of all the products gets maximized subject
to the following two constraints: total selection cost for each product is less
than or equal to the allocated budget for that product, and the difference
between the influence for any two products is less than or equal to a given
threshold. We show that the problem is NP-hard to solve optimally. We formulate
this problem as a linear programming problem and use linear programming
relaxation with randomized rounding. Further, we propose a greedy-based
heuristic with balance correction to solve this problem. We conduct a number of
experiments with real-world trajectory and billboard datasets, and the results
are reported. From the reported results, we observe that the proposed solution
approaches lead to more influence compared to many baseline methods.

### [91] [Downsizing Diffusion Models for Cardinality Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20681)
*Xinhe Mu,Zhaoqi Zhou,Zaijiu Shang,Chuan Zhou,Gang Fu,Guiying Yan,Guoliang Li,Zhiming Ma*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Introduces ADC, a compact diffusion-based joint cardinality estimator that computes densities via learned score integration and refines GMM selectivity estimates with importance sampling; ADC+ adds a decision tree to avoid corrections when unnecessary, improving speed and accuracy—outperforming several learned baselines and showing strong robustness to complex correlations


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage success of diffusion models for high-dimensional density estimation to build compact, accurate joint cardinality estimator requiring less storage and robust to complex correlations

Method: Score-based diffusion modeling with lightweight score estimator and GMM+importance sampling; ADC+ adds decision tree to skip correction for high-selectivity queries

Result: ADC computes pointwise densities by integrating learned score function; selectivity estimated by GMM then corrected via importance-sampling using density estimator; ADC+ uses decision tree to skip correction for high-volume/high-selectivity queries reducing variance and latency; achieves comparable or better accuracy than Naru and others while using ~66% storage and much higher robustness in synthetic complex-correlation datasets

Conclusion: ADC/ADC+ provide a storage-efficient, accurate, and robust approach to joint distribution cardinality estimation by combining diffusion-based density estimation, GMM selectivity modeling, importance sampling correction, and a decision-tree-based optimization to reduce correction-induced variance and latency

Abstract: Inspired by the performance of score-based diffusion models in estimating
complex text, video, and image distributions with thousands of dimensions, we
introduce Accelerated Diffusion Cardest (ADC), the first joint distribution
cardinality estimator based on a downsized diffusion model.
  To calculate the pointwise density value of data distributions, ADC's density
estimator uses a formula that evaluates log-likelihood by integrating the score
function, a gradient mapping which ADC has learned to efficiently approximate
using its lightweight score estimator. To answer ranged queries, ADC's
selectivity estimator first predicts their selectivity using a Gaussian Mixture
Model (GMM), then uses importance sampling Monte Carlo to correct its
predictions with more accurate pointwise density values calculated by the
density estimator. ADC+ further trains a decision tree to identify the
high-volume, high-selectivity queries that the GMM alone can predict very
accurately, in which case it skips the correction phase to prevent Monte Carlo
from adding more variance. Doing so lowers median Q-error and cuts per-query
latency by 25 percent, making ADC+ usually twice as fast as Naru, arguably the
state-of-the-art joint distribution cardinality estimator.
  Numerical experiments using well-established benchmarks show that on all
real-world datasets tested, ADC+ is capable of rivaling Naru and outperforming
MSCN, DeepDB, LW-Tree, and LW-NN using around 66 percent their storage space,
being at least 3 times as accurate as MSCN on 95th and 99th percentile error.
Furthermore, on a synthetic dataset where attributes exhibit complex,
multilateral correlations, ADC and ADC+ are considerably robust while almost
every other learned model suffered significant accuracy declines. In this case,
ADC+ performs better than any other tested model, being 10 times as accurate as
Naru on 95th and 99th percentile error.
