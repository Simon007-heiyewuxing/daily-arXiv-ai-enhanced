However, forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations remains a key challenge, and learning such forecasting from noisy, real-world data remains relatively unexplored. We introduce FOFPred, a novel language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model featuring a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture. This unique combination enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction. Our model is trained on web-scale human activity data-a highly scalable but unstructured source. To extract meaningful signals from this noisy video-caption data, we employ crucial data preprocessing techniques and our unified architecture with strong image pretraining. The resulting trained model is then extended to tackle two distinct downstream tasks in control and generation. Evaluations across robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings establish the cross-domain versatility of FOFPred, confirming the value of a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFOFPred\uff1a\u7edf\u4e00VLM+\u6269\u6563\u67b6\u6784\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u7f51\u7edc\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u5149\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u672a\u6765\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bc6\u96c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5982\u5149\u6d41\uff09\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4ef7\u503c\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u5608\u6742\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684FOFPred\u4f7f\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u89c6\u9891-\u5b57\u5e55\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "FOFPred\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u5149\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7f51\u7edc\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u5b57\u5e55\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u672a\u6765\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5173\u952e\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0cFOFPred\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u63a7\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7edf\u4e00VLM-\u6269\u6563\u4f53\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4ece\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u5149\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

An Exploratory Study", "comment": null, "summary": "As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors.

Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored.

Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets.

Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728ResNet-50\u4e0a\u5bf956\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c21\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406OOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u505a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0eOOD\u6027\u80fd\u5448\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u5148\u5347\u540e\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u548cOOD\u6548\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff08\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316ID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u540e\u7eed\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u65e2\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u53c8\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522b\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6837\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u56fa\u5b9aResNet-50\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6536\u96c656\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u4f53\u7b49\uff09\u5f97\u5230\u7684ImageNet\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u57fa\u51c621\u79cd\u540e\u9a8c\uff08post-hoc\uff09\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u57288\u4e2aOOD\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b-\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0ID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0eOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5448\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5148\u968f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u5347\u800c\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u624b\u6bb5\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u9002\u7684\u6700\u4f73OOD\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8ffd\u6c42\u66f4\u9ad8ID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u4e0d\u603b\u662f\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u5728\u8d85\u8fc7\u57fa\u7ebf\u540e\uff0cOOD\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u6700\u4f73OOD\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u4e07\u80fd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper investigates the impact of reducing the captured knowledge from temporal data, while increasing the resolution of the frames. To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs. The variants include special attention blocks within their architecture, such as convolutional block attention module (CBAM), temporal convolution networks (TCN), in addition to multi-headed and channel attention mechanisms. The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D.

However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance.

While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM.

While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment.

The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIDDR-NGP\uff0c\u5728Instant-NGP\u4e0a\u7ed3\u5408LPIPS\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8865\u507f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u53bb\u9664\u591a\u79cd\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u7269\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u578b\u5e72\u6270\u7269\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u96ea\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd3D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u5e0c\u671b\u5c06\u9690\u5f0f3D\u8868\u793a\u4e0e2D\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u591a\u5f20\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf\u9ad8\u6548\u6062\u590d\u5e72\u51c03D\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u5728Instant-NGP\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u52a0\u51652D\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u6270\u50cf\u7d20\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1LPIPS\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8865\u507f\u635f\u5931(MVCL)\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6e32\u67d3\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u7531\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIDDR-NGP\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u53bb\u9664\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728Instant-NGP\u4e0a\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u53bb\u9664\u591a\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u7269\uff08\u96ea\u82b1\u3001\u5f69\u5e26\u3001\u843d\u53f6\u3001\u82b1\u74e3\u7b49\uff09\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u9690\u5f0f3D\u8868\u793a\u4e0e2D\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LPIPS\u635f\u5931\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u8865\u507f\u635f\u5931\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u505a\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u53bb\u9664\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eSOTA\u53bb\u96ea\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "IDDR-NGP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9690\u5f0f3D\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u53bb\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u5e72\u6270\u7c7b\u578b\u5e76\u53ef\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6548\u679c\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f9b\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model.

This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback.

While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench.

However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections.

Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVIGA\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u95ed\u73af\u8fed\u4ee3\u5199-\u8fd0\u884c-\u6e32\u67d3-\u6bd4\u8f83-\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u9006\u56fe\u5f62\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u4e0e\u6f14\u8fdb\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u56fe\u5f62\u91cd\u6784\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5f52\u56e0\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u56fe\u5f62\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u9519\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6267\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u624d\u80fd\u5f25\u5408\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "VIGA\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u548c\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u8fdb\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff08\u5305\u542b\u8ba1\u5212\u3001\u4ee3\u7801\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u5386\u53f2\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u6574\u4f53\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3a\u4ece\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u6216\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u8fd0\u884c/\u6e32\u67d3\u73af\u5883\u3001\u6bd4\u8f83\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u95ed\u73af\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8eone-shot\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1aBlenderGym\u63d0\u534735.32%\uff0cSlideBench\u63d0\u5347117.17%\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u5f15\u5165\u7684BlenderBench\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347124.70%\u3002VIGA\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u9002\u914d\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7840VLM\uff0c\u4e14\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u534f\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "VIGA\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u7684write-run-render-compare-revise\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u9006\u56fe\u5f62\u91cd\u6784\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u5757\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u59823D\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u573a\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u30014D\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u30012D\u6587\u6863\u7f16\u8f91\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost.

However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations.

While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eRectified Flow\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c3D\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6216SDS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176SDS\u5b58\u5728\u8017\u65f6\u3001\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u5361\u901a\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u4efb\u610fRectified Flow\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f20\u8f93\uff08joint transport of a segment\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u907f\u514dSDS\u7684\u9ad8\u6602\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c3D\u5f62\u72b6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u65ad\u6210\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u6837\u672c\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eRectified Flow\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6837\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u4f20\u8f93\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4SDS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5efa\u7acb\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u4f5c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684Rectified Flow\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c3D\u5f62\u72b6\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u57283D\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8d28\u91cf\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\u51e0\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6210\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u57283D\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u573a\u666f\uff08UMS\uff09\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u6587\u77e5\u8bc6\u5efa\u6a21\uff08ITKM\uff09\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\uff08\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u6362\u88c5\u7b49\uff09\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\uff0c\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u573a\u666f\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u52a0\u4e0a\u591a\u573a\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u635f\u5931\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u5f02\u6784\u5339\u914d\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u9760\u6b63\u6837\u672c\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u4e13\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dReID\u5de5\u4f5c\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u89c1-\u7ea2\u5916\u3001\u6362\u88c5\u6216\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08CLIP\uff09\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u672c\u8026\u5408\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u573a\u666fReID\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CLIP\uff0cITKM\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\n- Stage I\uff1a\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u573a\u666f\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u573a\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\n- Stage II\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u7ec4\u4e0eStage I\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5173\u8054\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5165\u591a\u573a\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u589e\u5927\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\n- Stage III\uff1a\u5148\u5229\u7528\u805a\u7c7b\u7ea7\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u5757\u83b7\u53d6\u573a\u666f\u5185\u53ef\u9760\u5f02\u6784\u6b63\u6837\u672c\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u53ef\u89c1\u4e0e\u7ea2\u5916\u540c\u4eba\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6587\u672c\u8868\u793a\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cITKM\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e13\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u573a\u666f\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ITKM\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528CLIP\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u573a\u666fReID\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u591a\u573a\u666f\u5206\u79bb\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f02\u6784\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6587\u672c\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5165ReID\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles.

Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset.

To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models.

However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU).

We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs.

Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol.

In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06VLM\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u6837\u672c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728SA\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7a00\u5c11\u4f46\u9700\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u5bf9\u8bc6\u522b\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7eafVLM\u867d\u5177\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4f46\u5728\u7f55\u89c1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u5c06VLM\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfCV\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5229\u7528VLM\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u5408\u4f20\u7edfCV\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668/\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff09\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9VLM\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u7ec6\u5316\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5148\u6311\u9009\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6837\u672c\uff1b4) \u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u8f93\u51fa\u7406\u7531\u94fe\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bf4\u660eVLM\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u667a\u80fd\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u65e0\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u786e\u8ba4\u6216\u8d28\u7591VLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3aSA\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u60c5\u5883\u611f\u77e5\uff08SA\uff09\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u5fae\u8c03\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u5e26\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets.

First, we employ the Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss). This metric effectively mitigates the sensitivity of Intersection over Union (IoU) to positional deviations in tiny objects.

By utilizing multi-scale convolutions, the EUCB gradually recovers spatial resolution and enhances the preservation of edge and texture details for tiny defects. Finally, this paper proposes the Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module. Tailored to the specific spatial distribution of PCB defects, this module adaptively strengthens perception within key scale intervals, achieving efficient fusion of local fine-grained features and global context information. Experimental results on the PKU-PCB dataset demonstrate that SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length.

Our method (1) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria, (2) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier, and (3) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure.

However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness.

This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality.

Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.", "AI": {"tldr": "ShapeR \u80fd\u4ece\u968f\u610f\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5229\u7528 SLAM \u70b9\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6807\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fee\u6b63\u6d41\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7a33\u5065\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u516c\u5236 3D \u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5927\u5e45\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 3D \u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e72\u51c0\u3001\u65e0\u906e\u6321\u3001\u826f\u597d\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u906e\u6321\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u6742\u4e71\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4ece\u968f\u610f\u6355\u6349\u5e8f\u5217\u9c81\u68d2\u751f\u6210\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027 SLAM\u30013D \u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u53d6\u7a00\u758f SLAM \u70b9\u3001\u5e26\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u9898\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u578b\u6d41\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08rectified flow transformer\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u8de8\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6742\u6ce2\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u516c\u5236\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf 3D \u7f51\u683c\u6216\u70b9\u4e91\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f5c\u8005\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5305\u542b 7 \u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3001178 \u4e2a\u5e26\u51e0\u4f55\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684 in-the-wild \u7269\u4f53\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cShapeR \u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728 Chamfer \u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u7ea6 2.7 \u500d\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "ShapeR \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u968f\u610f\u62cd\u6444\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f SLAM \u70b9\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6709\u59ff\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u516c\u5236 3D \u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.
