*Yufeng Zhong,Lei Chen,Zhixiong Zeng,Xuanle Zhao,Deyang Jiang,Liming Zheng,Jing Huang,Haibo Qiu,Peng Shi,Siqi Yang,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出面向格式敏感文档的强化学习方法（FD-RL）：通过熵筛选找到格式密集样本，并按格式类型设计解耦奖励，实现格式级验证以减少高不确定性输出，从而提升OCR在公式/表格等复杂格式上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到先进OCR模型在格式化文本（如公式、表格）上的输出熵远高于普通文本，表明模型在格式敏感文档上存在高不确定性问题；因此提出通过多种阅读路径的推理和有针对性的优化来降低不确定性并提升识别准确率。

Method: 先用输出熵识别格式密集样本；对这些样本应用格式解耦的强化学习训练，设计针对不同格式（公式、表格等）的奖励函数以进行格式级验证而非逐字记忆；同时采用熵基础的数据过滤策略，只在高熵实例上进行优化。

Result: 在OmniDocBench上达到90.41平均分，创端到端模型新纪录；广泛的消融实验验证了各组成部分（数据、训练、过滤、奖励）的贡献。

Conclusion: FD-RL在OmniDocBench上取得90.41的平均分，显著提升了端到端OCR模型在格式敏感文档上的性能；消融实验证明了数据筛选、训练策略和奖励设计的有效性。

Abstract: Reading text from images or scanned documents via OCR models has been a longstanding focus of researchers. Intuitively, text reading is perceived as a straightforward perceptual task, and existing work primarily focuses on constructing enriched data engineering to enhance SFT capabilities. In this work, we observe that even advanced OCR models exhibit significantly higher entropy in formatted text (\emph{e.g.}, formula, table, etc.) compared to plain text, often by an order of magnitude. These statistical patterns reveal that advanced OCR models struggle with high output uncertainty when dealing with format sensitive document, suggesting that reasoning over diverse reading pathways may improve OCR performance. To address this, we propose format decoupled reinforcement learning (FD-RL), which leverages high-entropy patterns for targeted optimization. Our approach employs entropy-based data filtration strategy to identify format-intensive instances, and adopt format decoupled rewards tailored to different format types, enabling format-level validation rather than token-level memorization. FD-RL achieves an average score of 90.41 on OmniDocBench, setting a new record for end-to-end models on this highly popular benchmark. More importantly, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies over data, training, filtering, and rewarding strategies, thoroughly validating their effectiveness.

### [2] [Bias Detection and Rotation-Robustness Mitigation in Vision-Language Models and Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08860)
*Tarannum Mithila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究视觉-语言模型和生成图像模型在图像旋转和分布变化下的鲁棒性与公平性，发现旋转会降低模型性能并放大人口学偏见；提出结合数据增强、表示对齐与模型正则化的旋转鲁棒缓解策略，实验证明可在不牺牲总体性能下提高鲁棒性并减少偏见放大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VLMs与生成模型在多模态任务上表现优异，但它们在输入变换（如旋转）与分布转移下的鲁棒性与公平性研究不足；旋转是常见的现实世界干扰，会影响下游决策并可能放大对特定群体的偏见，因此需要系统性分析与可行的缓解方法。

Method: 分析部分：对比不同旋转角度与分布转移下模型预测变化、置信分布与对不同人口统计群体的误差差异；缓解方法：1) 旋转数据增强（包括合成与实拍）与对比学习，2) 表示对齐（旋转不变特征学习、投影头一致性损失）、3) 模型正则化（置信惩罚、群体对齐损失）；实验在多个数据集上评估分类准确率、置信校准、偏见放大和生成质量指标。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，提出的方法在旋转角度范围内显著提升准确率和置信校准，减少不同群体间的误差差距与偏见放大；生成模型在旋转扰动下生成质量下降被缓解，整体性能几乎无下降，部分任务甚至有小幅提升。

Conclusion: 旋转和分布转移会破坏VLMs与生成模型的预测准确性、置信校准与公平性；通过数据增强、表示对齐与模型级正则化的组合策略，可以显著提升模型在旋转扰动下的鲁棒性并减轻偏见扩散，同时保持总体性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and generative image models have achieved remarkable performance across multimodal tasks, yet their robustness and fairness under input transformations remain insufficiently explored. This work investigates bias propagation and robustness degradation in state-of-the-art vision-language and generative models, with a particular focus on image rotation and distributional shifts. We analyze how rotation-induced perturbations affect model predictions, confidence calibration, and demographic bias patterns. To address these issues, we propose rotation-robust mitigation strategies that combine data augmentation, representation alignment, and model-level regularization. Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve robustness while reducing bias amplification without sacrificing overall performance. This study highlights critical limitations of current multimodal systems and provides practical mitigation techniques for building more reliable and fair AI models.

*Qingyu Liu,Zhongjie Ba,Jianmin Guo,Qiu Wang,Zhibo Wang,Jie Shi,Kui Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R^2BD通过G-LDM与单步残差偏差计算，显著提升了伪图像检测的效率（≈22×）和跨范式泛化（平均精度提升≈13.87%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于重建的AIGC图像检测虽能提升跨分布泛化，但依赖扩散模型且需多步反演导致效率低下且无法覆盖GAN等生成范式，亟需一个高效且适用于多种生成模型的检测框架。

Method: 提出G-LDM统一重建模型以模拟VAE、GAN与扩散模型的生成行为，并设计残差偏差计算模块在单次推理中完成真伪区分，避免了多步反演重建；在10个公开数据集上进行大量基准测试，比较了与现有重建式方法的速度与精度。

Result: 在10个公开数据集基准上，R^2BD比现有重建式方法快约22倍，跨数据集平均检测精度提升约13.87%，在速度与泛化性上均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了R^2BD框架，通过统一的G-LDM重建模型和一次性残差偏差计算模块，实现了对多种生成范式（VAE、GAN、扩散模型）伪图像的高效检测。相较于以往基于扩散式重建的方法，R^2BD在速度上提高了约22倍，并在跨数据集评估中平均提升了约13.87%的检测精度，兼具效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, reconstruction-based methods have gained attention for AIGC image detection. These methods leverage pre-trained diffusion models to reconstruct inputs and measure residuals for distinguishing real from fake images. Their key advantage lies in reducing reliance on dataset-specific artifacts and improving generalization under distribution shifts. However, they are limited by significant inefficiency due to multi-step inversion and reconstruction, and their reliance on diffusion backbones further limits generalization to other generative paradigms such as GANs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel fake image detection framework, called R$^2$BD, built upon two key designs: (1) G-LDM, a unified reconstruction model that simulates the generation behaviors of VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models, thereby broadening the detection scope beyond prior diffusion-only approaches; and (2) a residual bias calculation module that distinguishes real and fake images in a single inference step, which is a significant efficiency improvement over existing methods that typically require 20$+$ steps.
  Extensive experiments on the benchmark from 10 public datasets demonstrate that R$^2$BD is over 22$\times$ faster than existing reconstruction-based methods while achieving superior detection accuracy. In cross-dataset evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by an average of 13.87\%, showing strong efficiency and generalization across diverse generative methods. The code and dataset used for evaluation are available at https://github.com/QingyuLiu/RRBD.

### [4] [Residual Cross-Modal Fusion Networks for Audio-Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08868)
*Yi Wang,Yinfeng Yu,Bin Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRFN uses bidirectional residual connections between audio and visual streams for effective fusion, improving performance and cross-domain robustness in audio-visual navigation; also reveals dataset-specific modality dependence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in multimodal fusion for audio-visual embodied navigation, preventing single-modality dominance and information degradation, especially in cross-domain scenarios.

Method: Design CRFN that introduces residual connections between audio and visual feature streams, enabling bidirectional interactions; incorporate stabilization techniques (e.g., normalization, residual weighting) to ensure training stability and preserve independent representations; evaluate on Replica and Matterport3D against fusion baselines and test cross-domain generalization.

Result: Propose Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network (CRFN) with bidirectional residual interactions and stabilization techniques, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on Replica and Matterport3D and showing stronger cross-domain generalization; discovered dataset-dependent modality reliance by agents.

Conclusion: Bidirectional residual fusion and stabilization lead to better complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment without collapsing modality independence, improving navigation performance and generalization; modality dependence varies by dataset, suggesting tailored fusion strategies.

Abstract: Audio-visual embodied navigation aims to enable an agent to autonomously localize and reach a sound source in unseen 3D environments by leveraging auditory cues. The key challenge of this task lies in effectively modeling the interaction between heterogeneous features during multimodal fusion, so as to avoid single-modality dominance or information degradation, particularly in cross-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a Cross-Modal Residual Fusion Network, which introduces bidirectional residual interactions between audio and visual streams to achieve complementary modeling and fine-grained alignment, while maintaining the independence of their representations. Unlike conventional methods that rely on simple concatenation or attention gating, CRFN explicitly models cross-modal interactions via residual connections and incorporates stabilization techniques to improve convergence and robustness. Experiments on the Replica and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that CRFN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art fusion baselines and achieves stronger cross-domain generalization. Notably, our experiments also reveal that agents exhibit differentiated modality dependence across different datasets. The discovery of this phenomenon provides a new perspective for understanding the cross-modal collaboration mechanism of embodied agents.

### [5] [ForensicFormer: Hierarchical Multi-Scale Reasoning for Cross-Domain Image Forgery Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08873)
*Hema Hariharan Samson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ForensicFormer，用分层多尺度跨注意力Transformer结合低/中/高层线索，实现对抗域外伪造检测：平均准确率86.8%，JPEG Q=70下83%准确率，像素级F1=0.76，比现有方法显著更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统取证方法难以应对AI生成图像和复杂编辑，需一个能融合不同语义层次并具备域外泛化能力的统一框架。

Method: hierarchical multi-scale cross-attention transformers combining low-level, mid-level, high-level analysis

Result: 86.8% avg accuracy across seven diverse OOD test sets; 83% accuracy at JPEG Q=70; 0.76 F1 for localization

Conclusion: ForensicFormer significantly outperforms prior universal detectors, robust to compression, and provides interpretable localization, enabling practical deployment for unknown manipulations

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated imagery and sophisticated editing tools has rendered traditional forensic methods ineffective for cross-domain forgery detection. We present ForensicFormer, a hierarchical multi-scale framework that unifies low-level artifact detection, mid-level boundary analysis, and high-level semantic reasoning via cross-attention transformers. Unlike prior single-paradigm approaches, which achieve <75% accuracy on out-of-distribution datasets, our method maintains 86.8% average accuracy across seven diverse test sets, spanning traditional manipulations, GAN-generated images, and diffusion model outputs - a significant improvement over state-of-the-art universal detectors. We demonstrate superior robustness to JPEG compression (83% accuracy at Q=70 vs. 66% for baselines) and provide pixel-level forgery localization with a 0.76 F1-score. Extensive ablation studies validate that each hierarchical component contributes 4-10% accuracy improvement, and qualitative analysis reveals interpretable forensic features aligned with human expert reasoning. Our work bridges classical image forensics and modern deep learning, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment where manipulation techniques are unknown a priori.

### [6] [Learning Domain-Invariant Representations for Cross-Domain Image Registration via Scene-Appearance Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08875)
*Jiahao Qin,Yiwen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SAR-Net，通过场景-外观解耦实现跨域图像配准；在共享潜空间通过重渲染避免亮度守恒假设破坏；给出两条理论性命题并在扫描显微镜上验证，显著优于基线且实时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统配准依赖亮度守恒，遇到系统性强度差异（域偏移）时失效；因此需要一种能在外观变化下仍能找到几何对应的方法。

Method: 方法基于将图像分解为域不变的场景表征与域特定的外观编码，配准通过在共享场景潜空间对齐并用目标外观重渲染来实现。引入场景一致性损失与域对齐损失，给出两条理论命题证明充分性与一致性条件。

Result: 在双向扫描显微镜数据集上取得0.885 SSIM和0.979 NCC，较最强基线提升3.1倍，实时77 fps；消融显示场景一致性和域对齐损失均关键，分别去掉会严重降性能。

Conclusion: SAR-Net能在有系统强度差异的跨域配准中，通过解耦场景与外观并以重渲染为手段实现一致性对齐，实验证明在真实显微镜场景下显著提升配准性能并保持实时性。

Abstract: Image registration under domain shift remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and medical imaging: when source and target images exhibit systematic intensity differences, the brightness constancy assumption underlying conventional registration methods is violated, rendering correspondence estimation ill-posed. We propose SAR-Net, a unified framework that addresses this challenge through principled scene-appearance disentanglement. Our key insight is that observed images can be decomposed into domain-invariant scene representations and domain-specific appearance codes, enabling registration via re-rendering rather than direct intensity matching. We establish theoretical conditions under which this decomposition enables consistent cross-domain alignment (Proposition 1) and prove that our scene consistency loss provides a sufficient condition for geometric correspondence in the shared latent space (Proposition 2). Empirically, we validate SAR-Net on bidirectional scanning microscopy, where coupled domain shift and geometric distortion create a challenging real-world testbed. Our method achieves 0.885 SSIM and 0.979 NCC, representing 3.1x improvement over the strongest baseline, while maintaining real-time performance (77 fps). Ablation studies confirm that both scene consistency and domain alignment losses are necessary: removing either degrades performance by 90% SSIM or causes 223x increase in latent alignment error, respectively. Code and data are available at https://github.com/D-ST-Sword/SAR-NET.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境复杂度和任务开放性的提升，传统将语义处理视为孤立模块的做法难以支持稳健、可迁移的感知-行动闭环；基础模型提供了跨域泛化和丰富语义先验，激发了将其整合进体现式AI以提升语义处理能力的需求。

Method: 通过综述和分析现有工作，作者提出语义生命周期框架，系统梳理和比较了基于基础模型在体现式AI中语义获取、表征、存储三阶段的最新进展，并从实践案例与理论视角讨论各方法的异同与适用场景。

Conclusion: 本文提出了“语义生命周期”作为统一框架，认为在基于基础模型的体现式AI中，语义信息是连续演化和维护的，而非孤立模块化处理。该框架强调了语义知识在获取、表征和存储三个关键阶段的持续流动，从而更好地利用基础模型的跨域泛化能力与语义先验，推动在复杂与开放任务中实现更稳健的感知-行动闭环。

Abstract: Semantic information in embodied AI is inherently multi-source and multi-stage, making it challenging to fully leverage for achieving stable perception-to-action loops in real-world environments. Early studies have combined manual engineering with deep neural networks, achieving notable progress in specific semantic-related embodied tasks. However, as embodied agents encounter increasingly complex environments and open-ended tasks, the demand for more generalizable and robust semantic processing capabilities has become imperative. Recent advances in foundation models (FMs) address this challenge through their cross-domain generalization abilities and rich semantic priors, reshaping the landscape of embodied AI research. In this survey, we propose the Semantic Lifecycle as a unified framework to characterize the evolution of semantic knowledge within embodied AI driven by foundation models. Departing from traditional paradigms that treat semantic processing as isolated modules or disjoint tasks, our framework offers a holistic perspective that captures the continuous flow and maintenance of semantic knowledge. Guided by this embodied semantic lifecycle, we further analyze and compare recent advances across three key stages: acquisition, representation, and storage. Finally, we summarize existing challenges and outline promising directions for future research.

*Yu Xu,Hongbin Yan,Juan Cao,Yiji Cheng,Tiankai Hang,Runze He,Zijin Yin,Shiyi Zhang,Yuxin Zhang,Jintao Li,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Tong-Yee Lee,Fan Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出将语义任务意图注入稀疏MoE路由，采用分层任务语义标注和预测对齐正则化，使专家按任务语义 specialize，从而缓解生成与编辑任务干扰，提升质量与保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一生成/编辑模型在密集Transformer中因共享参数空间导致任务干扰，传统MoE门控只基于局部特征且对任务意图盲目，無法形成有意义的专家特化。

Method: 1）分层任务语义标注（scope, type, preservation）构造任务描述符；2）在路由器中加入语义输入，并设计预测对齐正则化，诱导门控决策与高层语义一致；3）训练MoE模型并分析专家分化。

Result: 在多个任务上，带语义对齐的MoE在质量和保真度上优于密集基线，且专家展示出清晰、语义相关的特化行为。

Conclusion: 通过在MoE路由中引入任务语义和对齐正则化，模型能有效减轻任务间干扰，专家自然形成与语义相关的特化，整体超越密集模型在生成质量与保真度上。

Abstract: Unified image generation and editing models suffer from severe task interference in dense diffusion transformers architectures, where a shared parameter space must compromise between conflicting objectives (e.g., local editing v.s. subject-driven generation). While the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm is a promising solution, its gating networks remain task-agnostic, operating based on local features, unaware of global task intent. This task-agnostic nature prevents meaningful specialization and fails to resolve the underlying task interference. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to inject semantic intent into MoE routing. We introduce a Hierarchical Task Semantic Annotation scheme to create structured task descriptors (e.g., scope, type, preservation). We then design Predictive Alignment Regularization to align internal routing decisions with the task's high-level semantics. This regularization evolves the gating network from a task-agnostic executor to a dispatch center. Our model effectively mitigates task interference, outperforming dense baselines in fidelity and quality, and our analysis shows that experts naturally develop clear and semantically correlated specializations.

### [9] [Compressing Vision Transformers in Geospatial Transfer Learning with Manifold-Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08882)
*Thomas Snyder,H. Lexie Yang,Stefan Schnake,Steffen Schotthöfer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Use DLRT manifold-constrained optimization to compress ViT-based geospatial foundation models during transfer learning, outperforming LoRA and enabling on-device deployment with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable deployment of large geospatial foundation models on resource-constrained edge devices by achieving compact architectures that maintain high downstream performance despite compression-induced accuracy loss.

Method: Apply DLRT manifold-constrained optimization to enforce structured low-dimensional parameterizations during transfer learning of vision transformers, optimizing compressed parameter manifolds aligned with downstream objectives; compare against off-the-shelf low-rank methods (e.g., LoRA) on multiple geospatial benchmarks.

Result: Compressed geospatial vision transformers via manifold-constrained DLRT preserve accuracy while reducing parameters.

Conclusion: DLRT enables strong structured low-dimensional parameterizations that achieve substantial parameter reduction with minimal accuracy degradation across geospatial tasks, outperforming standard low-rank methods like LoRA and facilitating edge deployment.

Abstract: Deploying geospatial foundation models on resource-constrained edge devices demands compact architectures that maintain high downstream performance. However, their large parameter counts and the accuracy loss often induced by compression limit practical adoption. In this work, we leverage manifold-constrained optimization framework DLRT to compress large vision transformer-based geospatial foundation models during transfer learning. By enforcing structured low-dimensional parameterizations aligned with downstream objectives, this approach achieves strong compression while preserving task-specific accuracy. We show that the method outperforms of-the-shelf low-rank methods as LoRA. Experiments on diverse geospatial benchmarks confirm substantial parameter reduction with minimal accuracy loss, enabling high-performing, on-device geospatial models.

### [10] [Adaptive few-shot learning for robust part quality classification in two-photon lithography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08885)
*Sixian Jia,Ruo-Syuan Mei,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一个结合LDA新颖性检测、两阶段回放增量学习和少样本DANN领域适配的自适应CV框架，在TPL制造环境中实现了高精度、数据高效的质量模型维护与部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态的视觉模型难以应对动态生产中出现的新缺陷类别、样本稀缺下的模型更新以及新部件几何导致的分布差异，亟需一种数据高效且可持续维护的解决方案。

Method: 基于同一尺度鲁棒骨干模型，集成三种方法：1）基于线性判别分析（LDA）的统计假设检验用于新颖性检测；2）两阶段带回放的少样本增量学习策略；3）少样本领域对抗神经网络（DANN）用于领域适配。

Result: 在TPL数据集（半球为源域、立方体为目标域；类别：良好、轻微损伤、损伤）上：新颖性检测准确率99-100%；增量学习用K=20样本将新类集成至92%准确率；领域适配用K=5 shot将目标域准确率提升至96.19%。

Conclusion: 提出了针对两光子光刻（TPL）质量检测的自适应计算机视觉框架，实现了在动态制造环境中对新缺陷类别的检测、从少量样本高效增量学习以及跨零件几何域的快速自适应。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is an advanced additive manufacturing (AM) technique for fabricating high-precision micro-structures. While computer vision (CV) is proofed for automated quality control, existing models are often static, rendering them ineffective in dynamic manufacturing environments. These models typically cannot detect new, unseen defect classes, be efficiently updated from scarce data, or adapt to new part geometries. To address this gap, this paper presents an adaptive CV framework for the entire life-cycle of quality model maintenance. The proposed framework is built upon a same, scale-robust backbone model and integrates three key methodologies: (1) a statistical hypothesis testing framework based on Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for novelty detection, (2) a two-stage, rehearsal-based strategy for few-shot incremental learning, and (3) a few-shot Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) for few-shot domain adaptation. The framework was evaluated on a TPL dataset featuring hemisphere as source domain and cube as target domain structures, with each domain categorized into good, minor damaged, and damaged quality classes. The hypothesis testing method successfully identified new class batches with 99-100% accuracy. The incremental learning method integrated a new class to 92% accuracy using only K=20 samples. The domain adaptation model bridged the severe domain gap, achieving 96.19% accuracy on the target domain using only K=5 shots. These results demonstrate a robust and data-efficient solution for deploying and maintaining CV models in evolving production scenarios.

*Satyaki Roy Chowdhury,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAMSA-UNet uses Monte Carlo Dropout-based learned smoothing prior plus multi-scale attention to produce more coherent and efficient tumor segmentations


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce noisy boundaries and spurious fluctuations in brain tumor segmentation by learning a smoothing prior

Method: Introduce UAMSA-UNet and core techniques

Result: Improved Dice by up to 4.5% and IoU by up to 4.0% on BraTS datasets; reduced FLOPs by 42.5% versus U-Net++

Conclusion: Combining multi-scale attention with a learned smoothing prior yields better, more efficient segmentation and can be extended with transformer modules

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is essential for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet many CNN and U-Net based approaches produce noisy boundaries in regions of tumor infiltration. We introduce UAMSA-UNet, an Uncertainty-Aware Multi-Scale Attention-based Bayesian U-Net that in- stead leverages Monte Carlo Dropout to learn a data-driven smoothing prior over its predictions, while fusing multi-scale features and attention maps to capture both fine details and global context. Our smoothing-regularized loss augments binary cross-entropy with a variance penalty across stochas- tic forward passes, discouraging spurious fluctuations and yielding spatially coherent masks. On BraTS2023, UAMSA- UNet improves Dice Similarity Coefficient by up to 3.3% and mean IoU by up to 2.7% over U-Net; on BraTS2024, it delivers up to 4.5% Dice and 4.0% IoU gains over the best baseline. Remarkably, it also reduces FLOPs by 42.5% rel- ative to U-Net++ while maintaining higher accuracy. These results demonstrate that, by combining multi-scale attention with a learned smoothing prior, UAMSA-UNet achieves both better segmentation quality and computational efficiency, and provides a flexible foundation for future integration with transformer-based modules for further enhanced segmenta- tion results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Thermo-LIO fuses thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR and LIO to provide calibrated, synchronized, real-time, large-scale SHM, outperforming traditional 2D thermography in detecting anomalies and defects


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: overcome limitations of 2D thermography for complex geometries, inaccessible areas, and subsurface defects in SHM

Method: multimodal fusion of thermal imaging and LiDAR aligned with LIO

Result: Thermo-LIO enables calibrated, synchronized fusion of thermal and LiDAR data, integrated with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry for large-scale coverage; experimental cases show improved detection of thermal anomalies and structural defects, real-time processing, and expanded inspection coverage

Conclusion: multimodal sensor integration (thermal + LiDAR + LIO) significantly improves diagnostic precision, coverage, and real-time monitoring for large-scale civil infrastructure SHM

Abstract: Traditional two-dimensional thermography, despite being non-invasive and useful for defect detection in the construction field, is limited in effectively assessing complex geometries, inaccessible areas, and subsurface defects. This paper introduces Thermo-LIO, a novel multi-sensor system that can enhance Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) by fusing thermal imaging with high-resolution LiDAR. To achieve this, the study first develops a multimodal fusion method combining thermal imaging and LiDAR, enabling precise calibration and synchronization of multimodal data streams to create accurate representations of temperature distributions in buildings. Second, it integrates this fusion approach with LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), enabling full coverage of large-scale structures and allowing for detailed monitoring of temperature variations and defect detection across inspection cycles. Experimental validations, including case studies on a bridge and a hall building, demonstrate that Thermo-LIO can detect detailed thermal anomalies and structural defects more accurately than traditional methods. The system enhances diagnostic precision, enables real-time processing, and expands inspection coverage, highlighting the crucial role of multimodal sensor integration in advancing SHM methodologies for large-scale civil infrastructure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PoseMaskRefine策略，将高可见性姿态关键点纳入SAM迭代校正流程，通过选择推理时前三个可见关键点，增强对遮挡和错误提示的鲁棒性，并在多个数据集上提升精度，同时保持模型泛化能力。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SAM在遮挡场景下分割人体时由于关键点不可见或错误提示导致的性能下降，希望在最小改动下提升其对遮挡的鲁棒性并保持泛化能力。

Method: 基于SAM 2.1，提出PoseMaskRefine微调策略：将姿态关键点作为提示与SAM原有迭代校正流程结合，训练时使用高可见性关键点，推理时选择前三个可见关键点以简化提示并减少错误敏感性，允许从单个关键点预测准确掩码。

Result: Pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM 2.1 with minimal encoder changes to improve occlusion robustness in human segmentation.

Conclusion: 在不显著改变编码器的前提下，通过将可见的姿态关键点融入SAM的迭代修正过程，可以在遮挡场景下显著提高人体分割的准确性和鲁棒性，且仍保持原始SAM的泛化特性。

Abstract: Segment Anything (SAM) provides an unprecedented foundation for human segmentation, but may struggle under occlusion, where keypoints may be partially or fully invisible. We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model. The code and pretrained models will be available at https://mirapurkrabek.github.io/BBox-MaskPose.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D microscopy makes it hard to tell true agglomeration vs overlap due to depth; improve focus estimation to separate in-focus vs out-of-focus instances

Method: Instance camera focus prediction + instance segmentation

Result: Proposed focus prediction network (2-class) + instance segmentation yields higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy on ammonium perchlorate and sugar crystal datasets compared to baselines

Conclusion: 结合实例焦点预测的实例分割可有效减少由于景深重叠导致的误判，适用于不同晶体数据集，优于基线模型

Abstract: Agglomeration refers to the process of crystal clustering due to interparticle forces. Crystal agglomeration analysis from microscopic images is challenging due to the inherent limitations of two-dimensional imaging. Overlapping crystals may appear connected even when located at different depth layers. Because optical microscopes have a shallow depth of field, crystals that are in-focus and out-of-focus in the same image typically reside on different depth layers and do not constitute true agglomeration. To address this, we first quantified camera focus with an instance camera focus prediction network to predict 2 class focus level that aligns better with visual observations than traditional image processing focus measures. Then an instance segmentation model is combined with the predicted focus level for agglomeration classification. Our proposed method has a higher agglomeration classification and segmentation accuracy than the baseline models on ammonium perchlorate crystal and sugar crystal dataset.

### [15] [Changes in Visual Attention Patterns for Detection Tasks due to Dependencies on Signal and Background Spatial Frequencies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09008)
*Amar Kavuri,Howard C. Gifford,Mini Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: In simulated DBT images, lesion detectability and gaze behavior depend on lesion morphology and background complexity; decision failures dominate errors and spiculated lesions attract longer fixations due to spatial frequency effects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how image and signal properties affect visual attention during signal detection in complex digital images, using DBT as a model.

Method: Use simulated DBT breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT) with two lesion types (3-mm sphere and 6-mm spicule) inserted during projection; six human observers performed locating and detection tasks on reconstructed slices; collected eye-gaze data and analyzed gaze metrics, detection performance, and error sources.

Result: Detection performance constrained by later perceptual stages; decision failures largest error source. Detectability influenced jointly by target morphology and background complexity with interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions indicating differential engagement of visual attention based on background and signal spatial frequency.

Conclusion: Visual attention and detectability in DBT depend on both lesion shape and background anatomy; decision processes are key failure points and spatial frequency interactions modulate attention, implying that designing imaging and training should consider these factors.

Abstract: We aim to investigate the impact of image and signal properties on visual attention mechanisms during a signal detection task in digital images. The application of insight yielded from this work spans many areas of digital imaging where signal or pattern recognition is involved in complex heterogenous background. We used simulated tomographic breast images as the platform to investigate this question. While radiologists are highly effective at analyzing medical images to detect and diagnose diseases, misdiagnosis still occurs. We selected digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images as a sample medical images with different breast densities and structures using digital breast phantoms (Bakic and XCAT). Two types of lesions (with distinct spatial frequency properties) were randomly inserted in the phantoms during projections to generate abnormal cases. Six human observers participated in observer study designed for a locating and detection of an 3-mm sphere lesion and 6-mm spicule lesion in reconstructed in-plane DBT slices. We collected eye-gaze data to estimate gaze metrics and to examine differences in visual attention mechanisms. We found that detection performance in complex visual environments is strongly constrained by later perceptual stages, with decision failures accounting for the largest proportion of errors. Signal detectability is jointly influenced by both target morphology and background complexity, revealing a critical interaction between local signal features and global anatomical noise. Increased fixation duration on spiculated lesions suggests that visual attention is differentially engaged depending on background and signal spatial frequency dependencies.

### [16] [Depth-Wise Representation Development Under Blockwise Self-Supervised Learning for Video Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09040)
*Jonas Römer,Timo Dickscheid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blockwise self-supervised learning applied to masked video transformers works surprisingly well: it converges and produces representations comparable to end-to-end training, but shows different learning dynamics—early emergence of high-level structure, later-block saturation, and token-level shifts—pointing to interface formation as a source of remaining gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation by applying blockwise self-supervised learning, addressing spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure, and compare learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development to end-to-end training.

Method: Blockwise self-supervised learning for masked video transformers

Result: Across model sizes and partition granularities, blockwise training converges and yields representations close to end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies; it exposes higher-level structure earlier, causes late-block saturation, and can induce token-level shifts not visible in pooled metrics.

Conclusion: Blockwise masked video modeling is a viable alternative to end-to-end backpropagation, producing near-baseline representations while revealing distinct depth-wise dynamics; remaining performance gaps stem from late-block saturation and interface effects that warrant further investigation.

Abstract: End-to-end backpropagation couples all layers through a global error signal, enabling coordinated learning but requiring long-range credit assignment. Motivated by recent progress in blockwise self-supervised learning (BWSSL), we ask whether masked video transformers can be trained without end-to-end backpropagation. Applying BWSSL to masked video modeling remains relatively underexplored and must handle spatiotemporal context and long-range temporal structure. More broadly, analyses that compare BWSSL and end-to-end training in terms of learning dynamics and depth-wise representation development remain sparse. We apply blockwise learning to a masked autoencoding video vision transformer by partitioning the encoder into blocks, each of which is optimized with a local masked reconstruction loss. Across model sizes and partition granularities, training converges and yields representations close to matched end-to-end baselines under linear-probe and retrieval proxies. In order to compare intermediate representations, we analyze depth-wise decodability, inter-block similarity, and patch-level diagnostics. Blockwise training exposes higher-level structure earlier, while later blocks saturate and operate in a more geometry-preserving regime. It can also induce token-level shifts consistent with stronger early mixing that pooled metrics can miss. These findings point to late-block saturation and interface formation as contributors to the remaining gap.

*Junze Shi,Yang Yu,Jian Shi,Haibo Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出STDTrack：通过稠密视频采样、时序传播时空令牌、MFIFM融合历史信息和质量更新的STM，以及多尺度预测头，在轻量级跟踪器上实现接近高性能结果且保持高帧率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前轻量级Transformer跟踪器训练普遍采用稀疏采样（每序列仅一对图像），导致时空信息挖掘不足，性能与大型高性能跟踪器存在差距；因此需在保持实时性的前提下引入更充分的时空依赖。

Method: 1) 稠密视频采样：训练阶段从序列中抽取多帧而非单模板单搜索，以充分利用时空信息。2) 时序传播时空令牌：设计一个跨帧传播的令牌以引导每帧特征提取，增强时序一致性。3) MFIFM：多帧信息融合模块在STM中融合历史上下文以丰富当前表示。4) STM与质量更新机制：维护时空令牌池并依据质量评估更新，保证信息可靠性。5) 多尺度预测头：动态适应目标尺度变化。

Result: STDTrack在轻量级Transformer跟踪中引入稠密视频采样与时空令牌维护机制，提升了时序信息利用率并保持实时性。

Conclusion: STDTrack通过引入可靠的时空依赖和历史信息融合显著缩小了轻量级与高性能跟踪器间的性能差距，在多个基准上取得领先，同时兼顾GPU/CPU实时性。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer-based lightweight object tracking have established new standards across benchmarks, leveraging the global receptive field and powerful feature extraction capabilities of attention mechanisms. Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来行星任务将需要地面与空中机器人协作，精确定位是高级自主性的基础。但用于训练的带真实位姿标签的数据稀缺，且地面视角与航拍视角存在域差距，需新的方法来在有限实测数据下实现可靠跨视角定位。

Abstract: Accurate localisation in planetary robotics enables the advanced autonomy required to support the increased scale and scope of future missions. The successes of the Ingenuity helicopter and multiple planetary orbiters lay the groundwork for future missions that use ground-aerial robotic teams. In this paper, we consider rovers using machine learning to localise themselves in a local aerial map using limited field-of-view monocular ground-view RGB images as input. A key consideration for machine learning methods is that real space data with ground-truth position labels suitable for training is scarce. In this work, we propose a novel method of localising rovers in an aerial map using cross-view-localising dual-encoder deep neural networks. We leverage semantic segmentation with vision foundation models and high volume synthetic data to bridge the domain gap to real images. We also contribute a new cross-view dataset of real-world rover trajectories with corresponding ground-truth localisation data captured in a planetary analogue facility, plus a high volume dataset of analogous synthetic image pairs. Using particle filters for state estimation with the cross-view networks allows accurate position estimation over simple and complex trajectories based on sequences of ground-view images.

*Yanguang Sun,Chao Wang,Jian Yang,Lei Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEFT: parameter-efficient, wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning enabling large foundation models for ORSI segmentation, beating 21 SOTA methods across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately localizing and segmenting relevant objects from optical remote sensing images is critical, but existing methods use moderate-scale pre-trained models and full fine-tuning which is infeasible for large-scale models due to GPU/memory/computational costs. Need a parameter-efficient method to adapt large foundation models for ORSI segmentation.

Method: Design a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts and dynamically regulate outputs to produce trainable features. Build an expert-guided conditional adapter that injects these features into frozen features to enhance fine-grained perception and iteratively updates both feature types for efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Proposed WEFT (dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning) with fewer trainable parameters. Introduced task-specific wavelet expert extractor and expert-guided conditional adapter to inject trainable features into frozen features and iteratively update both. Outperforms 21 SOTA methods on three ORSI datasets and achieves top results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

Conclusion: WEFT efficiently adapts large-scale models to ORSI segmentation by leveraging wavelet experts and conditional adapters, reducing trainable parameters while improving performance; demonstrated superior results on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting relevant objects from optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) is critical for advancing remote sensing applications. Existing methods are typically built upon moderate-scale pre-trained models and employ diverse optimization strategies to achieve promising performance under full-parameter fine-tuning. In fact, deeper and larger-scale foundation models can provide stronger support for performance improvement. However, due to their massive number of parameters, directly adopting full-parameter fine-tuning leads to pronounced training difficulties, such as excessive GPU memory consumption and high computational costs, which result in extremely limited exploration of large-scale models in existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic wavelet expert-guided fine-tuning paradigm with fewer trainable parameters, dubbed WEFT, which efficiently adapts large-scale foundation models to ORSIs segmentation tasks by leveraging the guidance of wavelet experts. Specifically, we introduce a task-specific wavelet expert extractor to model wavelet experts from different perspectives and dynamically regulate their outputs, thereby generating trainable features enriched with task-specific information for subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we construct an expert-guided conditional adapter that first enhances the fine-grained perception of frozen features for specific tasks by injecting trainable features, and then iteratively updates the information of both types of feature, allowing for efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that our WEFT not only outperforms 21 state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three ORSIs datasets, but also achieves optimal results in camouflage, natural, and medical scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-Aug uses SAM-derived region priors and RegionSmoothLoss to regularize few-shot temporal segmentation, improving mIoU without extra labels


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve few-shot land cover mapping by using SAM to provide geometry-aware mask priors and enforce consistency across temporal frames, addressing scarcity of labeled data

Method: Proposed method; SAM-Aug with RegionSmoothLoss

Result: On PASTIS-R 5% labeled: mean test mIoU 36.21% averaged over seeds, +2.33 pp over SOTA (+6.89% relative); best split seed=42 yields 40.28% (11.2% relative gain)

Conclusion: Foundation models like SAM can be used as unsupervised geometric regularizers to boost few-shot remote sensing segmentation, offering a plug-and-play annotation-efficient approach.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation of time-series remote sensing images remains a critical challenge, particularly in regions where labeled data is scarce or costly to obtain. While state-of-the-art models perform well under full supervision, their performance degrades significantly under limited labeling, limiting their real-world applicability. In this work, we propose SAM-Aug, a new annotation-efficient framework that leverages the geometry-aware segmentation capability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to improve few-shot land cover mapping. Our approach constructs cloud-free composite images from temporal sequences and applies SAM in a fully unsupervised manner to generate geometry-aware mask priors. These priors are then integrated into training through a proposed loss function called RegionSmoothLoss, which enforces prediction consistency within each SAM-derived region across temporal frames, effectively regularizing the model to respect semantically coherent structures. Extensive experiments on the PASTIS-R benchmark under a 5 percent labeled setting demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SAM-Aug. Averaged over three random seeds (42, 2025, 4090), our method achieves a mean test mIoU of 36.21 percent, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline by +2.33 percentage points, a relative improvement of 6.89 percent. Notably, on the most favorable split (seed=42), SAM-Aug reaches a test mIoU of 40.28 percent, representing an 11.2 percent relative gain with no additional labeled data. The consistent improvement across all seeds confirms the generalization power of leveraging foundation model priors under annotation scarcity. Our results highlight that vision models like SAM can serve as useful regularizers in few-shot remote sensing learning, offering a scalable and plug-and-play solution for land cover monitoring without requiring manual annotations or model fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出 slow4fast-VLN 框架，模拟人类快慢认知，通过快推理模块实时决策并积累执行记忆，慢推理模块深度反思并提取结构化经验，反哺快推理以增强在未知环境和不一致指令下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 VLN 基于封闭集假设，在训练和测试时图像与指令风格一致，但现实世界开放多变，需提升在多样环境与不一致指令下的泛化能力，因此提出 GSA-VLN 并借鉴人类快慢认知机制以生成稳定的泛化策略。

Method: 构建快推理模块（端到端策略网络）用于实时动作输出并保存执行记录；构建慢推理模块用于分析历史记忆、深度反思并抽取可复用经验；将慢推理提取的结构化经验用于持续优化快推理模块，形成闭环交互。

Result: 框架实现了快慢模块的交互式学习，提升了面对未知环境和指令时的适应性与执行效率（抽象结果，原文未给出具体数值）。

Conclusion: slow4fast-VLN 通过快慢交互推理机制在 GSA-VLN 任务上提高了导航策略的泛化与适应性，使系统能在未见场景中持续优化并高效执行导航任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation aims to enable agents to navigate to a target location based on language instructions. Traditional VLN often follows a close-set assumption, i.e., training and test data share the same style of the input images and instructions. However, the real world is open and filled with various unseen environments, posing enormous difficulties for close-set methods. To this end, we focus on the General Scene Adaptation (GSA-VLN) task, aiming to learn generalized navigation ability by introducing diverse environments and inconsistent intructions.Towards this task, when facing unseen environments and instructions, the challenge mainly lies in how to enable the agent to dynamically produce generalized strategies during the navigation process. Recent research indicates that by means of fast and slow cognition systems, human beings could generate stable policies, which strengthen their adaptation for open world. Inspired by this idea, we propose the slow4fast-VLN, establishing a dynamic interactive fast-slow reasoning framework. The fast-reasoning module, an end-to-end strategy network, outputs actions via real-time input. It accumulates execution records in a history repository to build memory. The slow-reasoning module analyze the memories generated by the fast-reasoning module. Through deep reflection, it extracts experiences that enhance the generalization ability of decision-making. These experiences are structurally stored and used to continuously optimize the fast-reasoning module. Unlike traditional methods that treat fast-slow reasoning as independent mechanisms, our framework enables fast-slow interaction. By leveraging the experiences from slow reasoning. This interaction allows the system to continuously adapt and efficiently execute navigation tasks when facing unseen scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Qwen3-VL的端到端结构感知多模态推理框架，通过可学习的字符槽查询与跨注意力机制，从视觉特征中检索字符位置信息，并将字符感知表示以残差调制注入视觉token，使语言模型基于显式结构先验自回归生成，配合LoRA实现高效领域适配，在合成与真实低质车牌数据集上显著优于恢复-识别组合与通用VLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的“恢复-然后识别”方法因像素级恢复目标与语义识别目标不一致导致伪影干扰和误差累积；通用VLM缺乏对车牌字符序列固定长度和顺序等结构化建模，因此需要将结构先验引入多模态大模型以提升低质量车牌识别性能。

Method: 构建Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module(CMRM)，引入可学习的Character Slot Queries，利用跨注意力从视觉特征检索对应字符证据，再通过残差调制将字符感知表示注入视觉tokens，最后基于Qwen3-VL进行自回归生成；使用LoRA进行参数高效微调以实现领域适配。

Result: 在合成与真实严重退化的数据集上，本文方法在识别准确率上显著超过现有恢复-识别组合方法和通用VLM，验证了结构化推理在低质量文本识别任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 将结构化先验与大模型的多模态推理能力结合，可有效解决低质量车牌识别中的恢复与识别目标不一致问题，CMRM的字符槽查询与残差注入机制显著提升识别性能，并通过LoRA保持大模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-world License Plate Recognition (LPR) faces significant challenges from severe degradations such as motion blur, low resolution, and complex illumination. The prevailing "restoration-then-recognition" two-stage paradigm suffers from a fundamental flaw: the pixel-level optimization objectives of image restoration models are misaligned with the semantic goals of character recognition, leading to artifact interference and error accumulation. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated powerful general capabilities, they lack explicit structural modeling for license plate character sequences (e.g., fixed length, specific order). To address this, we propose an end-to-end structure-aware multimodal reasoning framework based on Qwen3-VL. The core innovation lies in the Character-Aware Multimodal Reasoning Module (CMRM), which introduces a set of learnable Character Slot Queries. Through a cross-attention mechanism, these queries actively retrieve fine-grained evidence corresponding to character positions from visual features. Subsequently, we inject these character-aware representations back into the visual tokens via residual modulation, enabling the language model to perform autoregressive generation based on explicit structural priors. Furthermore, combined with the LoRA parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, the model achieves domain adaptation while retaining the generalization capabilities of the large model. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world severely degraded datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing restoration-recognition combinations and general VLMs, validating the superiority of incorporating structured reasoning into large models for low-quality text recognition tasks.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of current vision-based rail defect detection methods, including high computational complexity, excessive parameter counts, and suboptimal accuracy. We propose a Lightweight Pyramid Cross-Attention Network (LPCANet) that leverages RGB-D data for efficient and accurate defect identification. The architecture integrates MobileNetv2 as a backbone for RGB feature extraction with a lightweight pyramid module (LPM) for depth processing, coupled with a cross-attention mechanism (CAM) for multimodal fusion and a spatial feature extractor (SFE) for enhanced structural analysis. Comprehensive evaluations on three unsupervised RGB-D rail datasets (NEU-RSDDS-AUG, RSDD-TYPE1, RSDD-TYPE2) demonstrate that LPCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 9.90 million parameters, 2.50 G FLOPs, and 162.60 fps inference speed. Compared to 18 existing methods, LPCANet shows significant improvements, including +1.48\% in $S_α$, +0.86\% in IOU, and +1.77\% in MAE over the best-performing baseline. Ablation studies confirm the critical roles of CAM and SFE, while experiments on non-rail datasets (DAGM2007, MT, Kolektor-SDD2) validate its generalization capability. The proposed framework effectively bridges traditional and deep learning approaches, offering substantial practical value for industrial defect inspection. Future work will focus on further model compression for real-time deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CenterPolar方法，通过类中心的离心扩展和向心约束两个阶段，动态扩展和收紧域分布，提升单域广义化深度度量学习（SDG-DML）对未见类别和域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SDG-DML方法依赖代理（proxy）为中心进行数据扩展，生成样本集中在类质心附近，无法模拟实际中更广泛、更远的域移位，限制了模型对未见域与类别的泛化能力。

Method: 提出两阶段协同的类中心极化：1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion (C^3E)：通过将源样本从类质心向外推移，进行离心扩展以生成更远的域样本；2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint (C^4)：将所有样本拉回类质心并通过类间分离约束保留判别信息，确保类不变性和可区分性。两阶段交替或协同训练以动态扩展并收紧域分布。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上进行了大量实验，CenterPolar在检索或度量学习任务指标上均优于基线和现有方法，证明该方法能生成更具多样性且有助泛化的域外样本和保持类内紧凑性。

Conclusion: CenterPolar在多个数据集（CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, Office-Home）上优于现有最先进方法，证明了其通过类中心的极化策略能更好地模拟远域分布并增强对未见类别和域的泛化能力。

Abstract: Single-domain generalized deep metric learning (SDG-DML) faces the dual challenge of both category and domain shifts during testing, limiting real-world applications. Therefore, aiming to learn better generalization ability on both unseen categories and domains is a realistic goal for the SDG-DML task. To deliver the aspiration, existing SDG-DML methods employ the domain expansion-equalization strategy to expand the source data and generate out-of-distribution samples. However, these methods rely on proxy-based expansion, which tends to generate samples clustered near class proxies, failing to simulate the broad and distant domain shifts encountered in practice. To alleviate the problem, we propose CenterPolar, a novel SDG-DML framework that dynamically expands and constrains domain distributions to learn a generalizable DML model for wider target domain distributions. Specifically, \textbf{CenterPolar} contains two collaborative class-centric polarization phases: (1) Class-Centric Centrifugal Expansion ($C^3E$) and (2) Class-Centric Centripetal Constraint ($C^4$). In the first phase, $C^3E$ drives the source domain distribution by shifting the source data away from class centroids using centrifugal expansion to generalize to more unseen domains. In the second phase, to consolidate domain-invariant class information for the generalization ability to unseen categories, $C^4$ pulls all seen and unseen samples toward their class centroids while enforcing inter-class separation via centripetal constraint. Extensive experimental results on widely used CUB-200-2011 Ext., Cars196 Ext., DomainNet, PACS, and Office-Home datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our CenterPolar over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released after acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用大模型在皮肤病学场景中受限于“扩散注意力”，难以从背景噪声中分离细微病变；作者认为仅靠参数放大不足以解决，应通过提升模型的几何表达能力和信息流效率来改进诊断精度。

Method: 引入Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder(Virtual-width DVE)以展开病变流形，并用两阶段强化学习——第一阶段对齐显式医学描述，第二阶段重建隐式诊断纹理，在受限语义空间内优化视觉信息传输。

Result: SkinFlow提出一种基于信息传输效率优化的皮肤科诊断框架，通过虚拟宽度动态视觉编码器和两阶段强化学习，在不增加模型参数的前提下提升对微小病变的分辨能力。实验证明在Fitzpatrick17k上显著优于大规模通用模型。

Conclusion: 优化几何容量与信息流比单纯参数扩展更能提升医学影像诊断性能，SkinFlow在皮肤病检测任务上显著领先。

Abstract: General-purpose Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), despite their massive scale, often falter in dermatology due to "diffuse attention" - the inability to disentangle subtle pathological lesions from background noise. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that parameter scaling is the only path to medical precision. We introduce SkinFlow, a framework that treats diagnosis as an optimization of visual information transmission efficiency. Our approach utilizes a Virtual-Width Dynamic Vision Encoder (DVE) to "unfold" complex pathological manifolds without physical parameter expansion, coupled with a two-stage Reinforcement Learning strategy. This strategy sequentially aligns explicit medical descriptions (Stage I) and reconstructs implicit diagnostic textures (Stage II) within a constrained semantic space. Furthermore, we propose a clinically grounded evaluation protocol that prioritizes diagnostic safety and hierarchical relevance over rigid label matching. Empirical results are compelling: our 7B model establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Fitzpatrick17k benchmark, achieving a +12.06% gain in Top-1 accuracy and a +28.57% boost in Top-6 accuracy over the massive general-purpose models (e.g., Qwen3VL-235B and GPT-5.2). These findings demonstrate that optimizing geometric capacity and information flow yields superior diagnostic reasoning compared to raw parameter scaling.

TL;DR: 提出SSVP方法，通过将DINOv3的多尺度结构先验与CLIP语义空间深度融合，并用跨模态注意力生成视觉条件提示与双门校准，提升无监督工业缺陷检测的细粒度感知能力，显著优于现有零样本方法，在MVTec-AD上达93.0% Image-AUROC与92.2% Pixel-AUROC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本异常检测仅依赖单一视觉主干，无法同时兼顾语义广泛性与结构细粒度判别，需引入多源视觉编码与动态语义提示以提升工业检测性能。

Method: 引入HSVS将DINOv3多尺度编码映射到CLIP语义空间，利用VCPG的跨模态注意力基于视觉特征动态生成文本提示，最后通过VTAM的双门校准将全局评分与局部证据对齐以提升定位精度。

Result: 在七个工业基准上的广泛评估表明，SSVP在MVTec-AD上实现93.0% Image-AUROC和92.2% Pixel-AUROC，显著超越现有零样本方法，展现出稳健性与优越的局部定位能力。

Conclusion: SSVP通过层级语义-视觉协同（HSVS）、视觉条件提示生成器（VCPG）和视觉-文本异常映射器（VTAM）三大模块，有效融合多尺度视觉特征与语义提示，解决了全局语义泛化与局部结构判别之间的矛盾，实现了领先的ZSAD性能和稳健性。

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enable supervision-free industrial inspection. However, existing ZSAD paradigms are constrained by single visual backbones, which struggle to balance global semantic generalization with fine-grained structural discriminability. To bridge this gap, we propose Synergistic Semantic-Visual Prompting (SSVP), that efficiently fuses diverse visual encodings to elevate model's fine-grained perception. Specifically, SSVP introduces the Hierarchical Semantic-Visual Synergy (HSVS) mechanism, which deeply integrates DINOv3's multi-scale structural priors into the CLIP semantic space. Subsequently, the Vision-Conditioned Prompt Generator (VCPG) employs cross-modal attention to guide dynamic prompt generation, enabling linguistic queries to precisely anchor to specific anomaly patterns. Furthermore, to address the discrepancy between global scoring and local evidence, the Visual-Text Anomaly Mapper (VTAM) establishes a dual-gated calibration paradigm. Extensive evaluations on seven industrial benchmarks validate the robustness of our method; SSVP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 93.0\% Image-AUROC and 92.2\% Pixel-AUROC on MVTec-AD, significantly outperforming existing zero-shot approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在自然破坏（如雪、雨）下稳定性不足，尤其在安全敏感任务中，需要方法提升模型面对自然变异时的鲁棒性和校准能力。

Method: 使用学习到的nuisance变换模型生成真实感破坏，并提出混合策略（随机覆盖加对抗细化）；在CURE-TSR数据集上对雪和雨破坏分别评估准确率、校准和训练复杂度。

Result: 模型基方法普遍优于Vanilla、对抗训练和AugMix；模型基对抗训练在所有破坏下最稳健但计算成本高；模型基数据增强在计算消耗更低的情况下达到与之相近的鲁棒性，性能降幅在统计上不显著。

Conclusion: 学习到的nuisance模型能有效提升在自然破坏下的鲁棒性，模型基的对抗训练最强但计算代价高，模型基的数据增强在计算复杂性低的同时保持相近性能。

Abstract: Robustness to natural corruptions remains a critical challenge for reliable deep learning, particularly in safety-sensitive domains. We study a family of model-based training approaches that leverage a learned nuisance variation model to generate realistic corruptions, as well as new hybrid strategies that combine random coverage with adversarial refinement in nuisance space. Using the Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Traffic Sign Recognition dataset (CURE-TSR), with Snow and Rain corruptions, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and training complexity across corruption severities. Our results show that model-based methods consistently outperform baselines Vanilla, Adversarial Training, and AugMix baselines, with model-based adversarial training providing the strongest robustness under across all corruptions but at the expense of higher computation and model-based data augmentation achieving comparable robustness with $T$ less computational complexity without incurring a statistically significant drop in performance. These findings highlight the importance of learned nuisance models for capturing natural variability, and suggest a promising path toward more resilient and calibrated models under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 评估GenAI文本到图像系统在高度规则化领域（建筑史）再现准确性的能力，识别误差模式并为政策、教学和数据集治理提出建议。

Method: 选取30条覆盖建筑风格、类型与规范化元素的提示，每个平台每条生成4张图像，共600张；两位建筑史学家按预先定义标准独立评分，分歧通过共识解决；以每组0-4张正确图像汇总设定准确率指标并比较平台与提示频度（Common vs Rare）。

Result: GenAI图像平台在建筑图像生成的准确性有限，存在重复错误模式，需要改进与监管。

Conclusion: 当前主流GenAI图像生成器在再现建筑细节和风格上存在显著不足，不能可靠替代专业历史学家或教材资源；需要建立数据溯源与标注规范，并在教育场景中限制使用或补充人工校审。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) text-to-image systems are increasingly used to generate architectural imagery, yet their capacity to reproduce accurate images in a historically rule-bound field remains poorly characterized. We evaluated five widely used GenAI image platforms (Adobe Firefly, DALL-E 3, Google Imagen 3, Microsoft Image Generator, and Midjourney) using 30 architectural prompts spanning styles, typologies, and codified elements. Each prompt-generator pair produced four images (n = 600 images total). Two architectural historians independently scored each image for accuracy against predefined criteria, resolving disagreements by consensus. Set-level performance was summarized as zero to four accurate images per four-image set. Image output from Common prompts was 2.7-fold more accurate than from Rare prompts (p < 0.05). Across platforms, overall accuracy was limited (highest accuracy score 52 percent; lowest 32 percent; mean 42 percent). All-correct (4 out of 4) outcomes were similar across platforms. By contrast, all-incorrect (0 out of 4) outcomes varied substantially, with Imagen 3 exhibiting the fewest failures and Microsoft Image Generator exhibiting the highest number of failures. Qualitative review of the image dataset identified recurring patterns including over-embellishment, confusion between medieval styles and their later revivals, and misrepresentation of descriptive prompts (for example, egg-and-dart, banded column, pendentive). These findings support the need for visible labeling of GenAI synthetic content, provenance standards for future training datasets, and cautious educational use of GenAI architectural imagery.

TL;DR: 提出了Non monotonic Efficient IoU (N EIoU)损失，通过非单调聚焦与宽高解耦重构定位梯度，提升难样本回归信号。在自采的水稻病叶数据集上，相较于CIoU提升mAP至90.3%（+4.3%），并在Android上通过TFLite Float16量化实现156ms/帧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对农业病叶图像中常见的小目标、低对比度以及低重叠难检样本，现有IoU类损失难以提供充足的回归梯度，导致定位与检测性能下降，因此提出N EIoU以增强弱回归信号并降低梯度干扰，提升边缘设备上的检测效果。

Method: 设计了一种基于非单调梯度聚焦与宽高解耦的N EIoU定位损失，重塑定位梯度以增强低IoU样本的信号并减弱梯度干扰；将该损失集成于轻量级YOLOv9t并在自采水稻病叶数据集上训练与评估，最后使用TFLite Float16量化部署在Android设备进行推理速度测试。

Conclusion: N EIoU有效改善了低重叠、难回归样本的定位信号，提升了小目标与低对比度病斑检测准确率，同时保持了轻量模型的实时性，适合边缘农业监测。

Abstract: In this work, we propose N EIoU YOLOv9, a lightweight detection framework based on a signal aware bounding box regression loss derived from non monotonic gradient focusing and geometric decoupling principles, referred to as N EIoU (Non monotonic Efficient Intersection over Union). The proposed loss reshapes localization gradients by combining non monotonic focusing with decoupled width and height optimization, thereby enhancing weak regression signals for hard samples with low overlap while reducing gradient interference. This design is particularly effective for small and low contrast targets commonly observed in agricultural disease imagery. The proposed N EIoU loss is integrated into a lightweight YOLOv9t architecture and evaluated on a self collected field dataset comprising 5908 rice leaf images across four disease categories and healthy leaves. Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance gains over the standard CIoU loss, achieving a mean Average Precision of 90.3 percent, corresponding to a 4.3 percent improvement over the baseline, with improved localization accuracy under stricter evaluation criteria. For practical validation, the optimized model is deployed on an Android device using TensorFlow Lite with Float16 quantization, achieving an average inference time of 156 milliseconds per frame while maintaining accuracy. These results confirm that the proposed approach effectively balances accuracy, optimization stability, and computational efficiency for edge based agricultural monitoring systems.

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏是将研究模型转换为运维友好、部署就绪的临床组件的可行路径，能在不额外改变部署管线的前提下降低模型容量并提升效率。

Abstract: Deploying medical image segmentation models in routine clinical workflows is often constrained by on-premises infrastructure, where computational resources are fixed and cloud-based inference may be restricted by governance and security policies. While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point-Seg integrates synthetic-data-trained point tracking into a transformer segmentation model, using tracked landmark trajectories and a temporal smoothing loss to produce temporally consistent myocardium segmentation, improving performance on low-quality echo and offering motion outputs for downstream analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve temporal consistency and reduce drift in myocardium segmentation across echocardiography video frames without relying on memory-based feature accumulation

Method: Transformer-based point-tracking guided segmentation

Result: Comparable Dice on high-quality echoes and improved accuracy and temporal stability on low-quality echoes; provides pixel-level myocardium motion information for downstream tasks

Conclusion: Point tracking is an effective temporal cue for stable, generalizable myocardium video segmentation, avoiding error accumulation from memory propagation and enabling pixel-level motion estimation.

Abstract: Purpose: Myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos is a challenging task due to low contrast, noise, and anatomical variability. Traditional deep learning models either process frames independently, ignoring temporal information, or rely on memory-based feature propagation, which accumulates error over time. Methods: We propose Point-Seg, a transformer-based segmentation framework that integrates point tracking as a temporal cue to ensure stable and consistent segmentation of myocardium across frames. Our method leverages a point-tracking module trained on a synthetic echocardiography dataset to track key anatomical landmarks across video sequences. These tracked trajectories provide an explicit motion-aware signal that guides segmentation, reducing drift and eliminating the need for memory-based feature accumulation. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal smoothing loss to further enhance temporal consistency across frames. Results: We evaluate our approach on both public and private echocardiography datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that Point-Seg has statistically similar accuracy in terms of Dice to state-of-the-art segmentation models in high quality echo data, while it achieves better segmentation accuracy in lower quality echo with improved temporal stability. Furthermore, Point-Seg has the key advantage of pixel-level myocardium motion information as opposed to other segmentation methods. Such information is essential in the computation of other downstream tasks such as myocardial strain measurement and regional wall motion abnormality detection. Conclusion: Point-Seg demonstrates that point tracking can serve as an effective temporal cue for consistent video segmentation, offering a reliable and generalizable approach for myocardium segmentation in echocardiography videos.

Motivation: 现有跨模态方法依赖配对NBI-WLI图像，获取成本高、不可扩展，大量非配对临床数据未被利用。需要一种无需配对但能在语义上对齐模态知识的方案。

Method: 在组级别进行两个模块的蒸馏：GKD-Pro通过共享的lesion-aware queries提取模态不变的语义原型并进行原型级蒸馏；GKD-Den用激活导出的关系图引导组感知注意力，实现局部结构的密集对齐。两模块联合维护全局语义一致性与局部结构相干性，无需图像一一配对。

Result: 在四个临床数据集上，PaGKD相较于最先进方法分别实现AUC提升3.3%、1.1%、2.8%和3.2%。

Conclusion: PaGKD在无需图像配对的情况下，能有效从NBI向WLI蒸馏知识，显著提升分类AUC，证明组级蒸馏能解决语义不匹配问题并开启了新的跨模态学习方向。

Abstract: White-Light Imaging (WLI) is the standard for endoscopic cancer screening, but Narrow-Band Imaging (NBI) offers superior diagnostic details. A key challenge is transferring knowledge from NBI to enhance WLI-only models, yet existing methods are critically hampered by their reliance on paired NBI-WLI images of the same lesion, a costly and often impractical requirement that leaves vast amounts of clinical data untapped. In this paper, we break this paradigm by introducing PaGKD, a novel Pairing-free Group-level Knowledge Distillation framework that that enables effective cross-modal learning using unpaired WLI and NBI data. Instead of forcing alignment between individual, often semantically mismatched image instances, PaGKD operates at the group level to distill more complete and compatible knowledge across modalities. Central to PaGKD are two complementary modules: (1) Group-level Prototype Distillation (GKD-Pro) distills compact group representations by extracting modality-invariant semantic prototypes via shared lesion-aware queries; (2) Group-level Dense Distillation (GKD-Den) performs dense cross-modal alignment by guiding group-aware attention with activation-derived relation maps. Together, these modules enforce global semantic consistency and local structural coherence without requiring image-level correspondence. Extensive experiments on four clinical datasets demonstrate that PaGKD consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving relative AUC improvements of 3.3%, 1.1%, 2.8%, and 3.2%, respectively, establishing a new direction for cross-modal learning from unpaired data.

Motivation: 现有方法仅在可见表面上预测可操作性，忽视被遮挡或未观测到的表面；而实际场景中常需对完整物体形状进行操作预测，因此需要从部分观察外推完整几何并在完整形状上定位可操作性。

Method: 1) 稀疏体素融合的多视角生成式重建，保持常数token复杂度；2) 基于流的可操作性定位，建模多模态分布；3) 可操作性驱动的主动视角选择，用于智能采样视角。

Result: Affostruction: generative framework for affordance grounding on full 3D shapes from partial RGBD observations; improves grounding and reconstruction significantly.

Conclusion: Affostruction能在缺失观测区域正确预测可操作性，通过生成式重建与建模可操作性分布的流模型，以及利用预测的可操作性进行主动视角选择，整体性能大幅优于仅在可见表面上定位的基线方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of affordance grounding from RGBD images of an object, which aims to localize surface regions corresponding to a text query that describes an action on the object. While existing methods predict affordance regions only on visible surfaces, we propose Affostruction, a generative framework that reconstructs complete geometry from partial observations and grounds affordances on the full shape including unobserved regions. We make three core contributions: generative multi-view reconstruction via sparse voxel fusion that extrapolates unseen geometry while maintaining constant token complexity, flow-based affordance grounding that captures inherent ambiguity in affordance distributions, and affordance-driven active view selection that leverages predicted affordances for intelligent viewpoint sampling. Affostruction achieves 19.1 aIoU on affordance grounding (40.4\% improvement) and 32.67 IoU for 3D reconstruction (67.7\% improvement), enabling accurate affordance prediction on complete shapes.

TL;DR: Introduces COOL-SD, a theoretically-grounded annealed relaxed speculative decoding method that optimizes resampling distribution and exploits annealing, improving speed-quality trade-offs in AR image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive (AR) image generation is slow due to sequential decoding and token ambiguity; prior relaxed speculative decoding lacks theoretical grounding. The paper aims to provide theoretical foundations and practical improvements.

Method: Analyze total variation distance to derive optimal resampling distribution minimizing an upper bound; use perturbation analysis to reveal annealing behaviour; design annealed resampling schedule and implement COOL-SD to accelerate AR image generation while preserving or improving quality.

Result: Proposes COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding, deriving an optimal resampling distribution via TV-distance analysis and showing annealing behaviour via perturbation analysis; achieves faster generation with comparable or better quality and validated improvements in experiments.

Conclusion: COOL-SD, grounded in TV-distance and perturbation analyses, provides an annealed speculative decoding scheme that improves generation latency or quality over prior relaxed speculative decoding methods, validated empirically.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in autoregressive image generation, inference remains slow due to the sequential nature of AR models and the ambiguity of image tokens, even when using speculative decoding. Recent works attempt to address this with relaxed speculative decoding but lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we establish the theoretical basis of relaxed SD and propose COOL-SD, an annealed relaxation of speculative decoding built on two key insights. The first analyzes the total variation (TV) distance between the target model and relaxed speculative decoding and yields an optimal resampling distribution that minimizes an upper bound of the distance. The second uses perturbation analysis to reveal an annealing behaviour in relaxed speculative decoding, motivating our annealed design. Together, these insights enable COOL-SD to generate images faster with comparable quality, or achieve better quality at similar latency. Experiments validate the effectiveness of COOL-SD, showing consistent improvements over prior methods in speed-quality trade-offs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve high-resolution, semantically meaningful image reconstruction from neural spike data by combining strong generative priors and multimodal feature guidance

Method: Two-stage generative decoding using VDVAE and Versatile Diffusion

Result: SpikeVAEDiff achieves high-resolution reconstructions; VISI region contributes most; VDVAE effective for preliminary reconstructions; ablations show specific brain regions improve performance

Conclusion: Combining VDVAE and Versatile Diffusion with region-specific spike mappings yields superior reconstructions compared to prior fMRI-based methods; brain-region selection matters for performance

Abstract: Reconstructing natural visual scenes from neural activity is a key challenge in neuroscience and computer vision. We present SpikeVAEDiff, a novel two-stage framework that combines a Very Deep Variational Autoencoder (VDVAE) and the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-resolution and semantically meaningful image reconstructions from neural spike data. In the first stage, VDVAE produces low-resolution preliminary reconstructions by mapping neural spike signals to latent representations. In the second stage, regression models map neural spike signals to CLIP-Vision and CLIP-Text features, enabling Versatile Diffusion to refine the images via image-to-image generation.
  We evaluate our approach on the Allen Visual Coding-Neuropixels dataset and analyze different brain regions. Our results show that the VISI region exhibits the most prominent activation and plays a key role in reconstruction quality. We present both successful and unsuccessful reconstruction examples, reflecting the challenges of decoding neural activity. Compared with fMRI-based approaches, spike data provides superior temporal and spatial resolution. We further validate the effectiveness of the VDVAE model and conduct ablation studies demonstrating that data from specific brain regions significantly enhances reconstruction performance.

Abstract: Infrared object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in complex environments (\eg, dark, snow, and rain) where visible imaging cameras are disabled by poor illumination. However, due to low contrast and weak edge information in infrared images, it is challenging to extract discriminative object features for robust detection. To deal with this issue, we propose a novel vision-language representation learning paradigm for infrared object detection. An additional textual supervision with rich semantic information is explored to guide the disentanglement of object and non-object features. Specifically, we propose a Semantic Feature Alignment (SFA) module to align the object features with the corresponding text features. Furthermore, we develop an Object Feature Disentanglement (OFD) module that disentangles text-aligned object features and non-object features by minimizing their correlation. Finally, the disentangled object features are entered into the detection head. In this manner, the detection performance can be remarkably enhanced via more discriminative and less noisy features. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on two benchmarks: M\textsuperscript{3}FD (83.7\% mAP), FLIR (86.1\% mAP). Our code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted.

Abstract: Person identification in forensic investigations becomes very challenging when common identification means for DNA (i.e., hair strands, soft tissue) are not available. Current methods utilize deep learning methods for face recognition. However, these methods lack effective mechanisms to model cross-domain structural correspondence between two different forensic modalities. In this paper, we introduce a SPOT-Face, a superpixel graph-based framework designed for cross-domain forensic face identification of victims using their skeleton and sketch images. Our unified framework involves constructing a superpixel-based graph from an image and then using different graph neural networks(GNNs) backbones to extract the embeddings of these graphs, while cross-domain correspondence is established through attention-guided optimal transport mechanism. We have evaluated our proposed framework on two publicly available dataset: IIT\_Mandi\_S2F (S2F) and CUFS. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our proposed framework. The experimental results show significant improvement in identification metrics ( i.e., Recall, mAP) over existing graph-based baselines. Furthermore, our framework demonstrates to be highly effective for matching skulls and sketches to faces in forensic investigations.

Motivation: Summarize why authors proposed this work

Method: Describe the method used in the paper

Result: Summarize key results claimed

Conclusion: Key takeaways and potential impacts

Abstract: Robust local feature representations are essential for spatial intelligence tasks such as robot navigation and augmented reality. Establishing reliable correspondences requires descriptors that provide both high discriminative power and computational efficiency. To address this, we introduce Cross-Layer Independent Deformable Description (CLIDD), a method that achieves superior distinctiveness by sampling directly from independent feature hierarchies. This approach utilizes learnable offsets to capture fine-grained structural details across scales while bypassing the computational burden of unified dense representations. To ensure real-time performance, we implement a hardware-aware kernel fusion strategy that maximizes inference throughput. Furthermore, we develop a scalable framework that integrates lightweight architectures with a training protocol leveraging both metric learning and knowledge distillation. This scheme generates a wide spectrum of model variants optimized for diverse deployment constraints. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves superior matching accuracy and exceptional computational efficiency simultaneously. Specifically, the ultra-compact variant matches the precision of SuperPoint while utilizing only 0.004M parameters, achieving a 99.7% reduction in model size. Furthermore, our high-performance configuration outperforms all current state-of-the-art methods, including high-capacity DINOv2-based frameworks, while exceeding 200 FPS on edge devices. These results demonstrate that CLIDD delivers high-precision local feature matching with minimal computational overhead, providing a robust and scalable solution for real-time spatial intelligence tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决变电站仪表缺陷样本稀缺问题，提供可控且真实的缺陷图像合成以提升工业检验模型的训练效果。

Method: 1) 使用DreamBooth风格对Stable Diffusion骨干进行知识嵌入微调，捕捉仪表结构纹理先验；2) 几何裂纹建模参数化缺陷属性生成像素级控制图；3) 轻量超网络根据控制图与高层描述动态调制去噪过程，实现可控合成。

Result: This paper proposes a Stable Diffusion based few-shot defect image generation framework for substation meters, integrating DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding, a geometric crack modeling module, and a hypernetwork-guided conditional control for pixel-level guidance and dynamic modulation during denoising.

Conclusion: 方法有效填补了自然图像预训练模型与工业设备场景间的域差，生成图像质量和多样性提升，基于增强数据训练的检测器mAP提高15.3%。

Abstract: Substation meters play a critical role in monitoring and ensuring the stable operation of power grids, yet their detection of cracks and other physical defects is often hampered by a severe scarcity of annotated samples. To address this few-shot generation challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates Knowledge Embedding and Hypernetwork-Guided Conditional Control into a Stable Diffusion pipeline, enabling realistic and controllable synthesis of defect images from limited data.
  First, we bridge the substantial domain gap between natural-image pre-trained models and industrial equipment by fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion backbone using DreamBooth-style knowledge embedding. This process encodes the unique structural and textural priors of substation meters, ensuring generated images retain authentic meter characteristics.
  Second, we introduce a geometric crack modeling module that parameterizes defect attributes--such as location, length, curvature, and branching pattern--to produce spatially constrained control maps. These maps provide precise, pixel-level guidance during generation.
  Third, we design a lightweight hypernetwork that dynamically modulates the denoising process of the diffusion model in response to the control maps and high-level defect descriptors, achieving a flexible balance between generation fidelity and controllability.
  Extensive experiments on a real-world substation meter dataset demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing augmentation and generation baselines. It reduces Frechet Inception Distance (FID) by 32.7%, increases diversity metrics, and--most importantly--boosts the mAP of a downstream defect detector by 15.3% when trained on augmented data. The framework offers a practical, high-quality data synthesis solution for industrial inspection systems where defect samples are rare.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeTracker通过运动解耦与跨帧特征融合，有效提升了不稳定卫星视频中微小目标的多目标跟踪性能；并提供了新的仿真基准SDM-Car-SU，实验证明其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星视频存在平台抖动与目标外观弱小的问题，这两者共同降低了多目标跟踪性能，现有方法在未稳定视频场景下效果不佳，因此需要专门针对平台运动与微小目标特征连续性进行设计。

Method: 提出了联合检测-跟踪框架DeTracker；设计Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD)模块做全局对齐与局部精化以分离平台运动与目标真实运动；设计Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP)模块进行跨帧特征融合以增强微小目标表征；构建了仿真基准SDM-Car-SU并在模拟与真实不稳定卫星视频上做大量实验。

Result: 在新构建的SDM-Car-SU数据集上达到61.1% MOTA，在真实不稳定卫星视频上达到47.3% MOTA，均显著优于现有方法，表明对平台运动解耦与时序特征融合的有效性。

Conclusion: DeTracker通过全局-局部运动解耦和时序依赖特征金字塔模块，有效提高了不稳定卫星视频中小目标的检测与跟踪性能，显著提升轨迹稳定性和表征连续性，实验结果在仿真与真实数据上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出A^2TG：为每个高斯splat引入基于梯度的自适应各向异性纹理分配，能在更低内存下提升或保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有带纹理的高斯splatting方法为每个基元分配固定方形纹理，导致内存浪费且不能适应场景中各向异性细节分布。为提高纹理利用率并支持各向异性细节表示，需要一种自适应、方向敏感的纹理分配机制。

Method: 在Gaussians Splatting框架中，为每个高斯体元引入各向异性纹理，并设计基于梯度的信息（可能是像素重构误差对纹理采样的梯度）来决定每个纹理的分辨率和纵横比，实现非均匀、重细节区域高分辨率的纹理分配；渲染时保留高效的实时splatting流程，同时通过这种纹理约束减少整体内存占用。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，A^2TG在显著降低内存需求的同时，实现与或优于固定方形纹理方法的渲染质量（图像保真度）；实验显示自适应各向异性纹理在细节还原和内存效率上具有一致优势。

Conclusion: A^2TG提出了一种为每个高斯基元分配各向异性纹理的方法，通过梯度引导的自适应规则共同确定纹理分辨率和长宽比，从而更有效地利用纹理内存并提升渲染质量。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a powerful representation for high-quality, real-time 3D scene rendering. While recent works extend Gaussians with learnable textures to enrich visual appearance, existing approaches allocate a fixed square texture per primitive, leading to inefficient memory usage and limited adaptability to scene variability. In this paper, we introduce adaptive anisotropic textured Gaussians (A$^2$TG), a novel representation that generalizes textured Gaussians by equipping each primitive with an anisotropic texture. Our method employs a gradient-guided adaptive rule to jointly determine texture resolution and aspect ratio, enabling non-uniform, detail-aware allocation that aligns with the anisotropic nature of Gaussian splats. This design significantly improves texture efficiency, reducing memory consumption while enhancing image quality. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that A TG consistently outperforms fixed-texture Gaussian Splatting methods, achieving comparable rendering fidelity with substantially lower memory requirements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过训练时附加可丢弃的LoRA分支来并行引入多样化的一对多标签分配策略，从而在不增加推理成本的情况下显著改善DETR式检测器的收敛和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR风格检测器一对一匹配端到端优雅但监督稀疏导致收敛慢；现有一对多方法复杂且架构专用，缺乏统一可扩展设计，故需一种轻量、通用且不增加推理成本的方案。

Method: 分析one-to-many监督的影响后，发现性能提升来源于分配策略的多样性而非监督数量；基于此，训练时在主模型中并行加入若干LoRA分支，每个分支对应不同的one-to-many规则，作为辅助模块提供多样监督梯度，训练结束后丢弃分支。

Result: 在多个基线和数据集上进行广泛实验，证明LoRA-DETR在保持原模型架构和推理成本不变的前提下，显著提升收敛速度和检测性能，达到了或超过现有最先进结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出LoRA-DETR，通过在训练阶段附加多个低秩适配(LoRA)分支实现多样化的one-to-many分配策略，从而提高DETR式检测器的收敛速度和性能，在推理时移除分支不增成本，保持架构简洁。

Abstract: Label assignment is a critical component in object detectors, particularly within DETR-style frameworks where the one-to-one matching strategy, despite its end-to-end elegance, suffers from slow convergence due to sparse supervision. While recent works have explored one-to-many assignments to enrich supervisory signals, they often introduce complex, architecture-specific modifications and typically focus on a single auxiliary strategy, lacking a unified and scalable design. In this paper, we first systematically investigate the effects of ``one-to-many'' supervision and reveal a surprising insight that performance gains are driven not by the sheer quantity of supervision, but by the diversity of the assignment strategies employed. This finding suggests that a more elegant, parameter-efficient approach is attainable. Building on this insight, we propose LoRA-DETR, a flexible and lightweight framework that seamlessly integrates diverse assignment strategies into any DETR-style detector. Our method augments the primary network with multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) branches during training, each instantiating a different one-to-many assignment rule. These branches act as auxiliary modules that inject rich, varied supervisory gradients into the main model and are discarded during inference, thus incurring no additional computational cost. This design promotes robust joint optimization while maintaining the architectural simplicity of the original detector. Extensive experiments on different baselines validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our work presents a new paradigm for enhancing detectors, demonstrating that diverse ``one-to-many'' supervision can be integrated to achieve state-of-the-art results without compromising model elegance.

Motivation: 现有VPR模型虽然性能好但内存及能耗高，不适合移动设备；紧凑模型又常表现出鲁棒性和泛化性不足。事件相机提供低延迟、低能耗的感测数据，结合高效SNN-VAE可在资源受限平台上实现可靠定位。

Result: 模型在作者新构建的室内VPR数据集上对16类场所实现了与现有方法可比的分类性能，并在多种光照条件下保持鲁棒。对未知场景的测试显示模型能区分已学场所与新场景，表明良好泛化能力与关键位置特征学习。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种结合事件相机与引导变分自编码器（VAE）的轻量化视觉场所识别（VPR）方法，能够在室内GPS不可用环境下为移动机器人提供高鲁棒性和泛化性的定位能力。

Abstract: Autonomous agents such as cars, robots and drones need to precisely localize themselves in diverse environments, including in GPS-denied indoor environments. One approach for precise localization is visual place recognition (VPR), which estimates the place of an image based on previously seen places. State-of-the-art VPR models require high amounts of memory, making them unwieldy for mobile deployment, while more compact models lack robustness and generalization capabilities. This work overcomes these limitations for robotics using a combination of event-based vision sensors and an event-based novel guided variational autoencoder (VAE). The encoder part of our model is based on a spiking neural network model which is compatible with power-efficient low latency neuromorphic hardware. The VAE successfully disentangles the visual features of 16 distinct places in our new indoor VPR dataset with a classification performance comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches while, showing robust performance also under various illumination conditions. When tested with novel visual inputs from unknown scenes, our model can distinguish between these places, which demonstrates a high generalization capability by learning the essential features of location. Our compact and robust guided VAE with generalization capabilities poses a promising model for visual place recognition that can significantly enhance mobile robot navigation in known and unknown indoor environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: address limitation of single-stage diffusion video generation models which entangle physical understanding and visual synthesis, causing failures to satisfy physical constraints

Method: PhyReason: large multimodal model for physical state reasoning + image generator for keyframes; PhyPlan: deterministic synthesis of coarse motion scaffold; PhyRefine: inject scaffold into diffusion sampling via latent fusion to refine appearance while keeping planned dynamics

Result: a training-free three-stage pipeline PhyRPR (PhyReason-PhyPlan-PhyRefine) that decouples physical reasoning from visual synthesis, enabling controllable, physically plausible video generation; experimentally improves physical plausibility and motion controllability

Conclusion: Staged design enables explicit physical control and better physics adherence during video synthesis; experiments show consistent improvements in physical plausibility and motion controllability

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based video generation models can synthesize visually plausible videos, yet they often struggle to satisfy physical constraints. A key reason is that most existing approaches remain single-stage: they entangle high-level physical understanding with low-level visual synthesis, making it hard to generate content that require explicit physical reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a training-free three-stage pipeline,\textit{PhyRPR}:\textit{Phy\uline{R}eason}--\textit{Phy\uline{P}lan}--\textit{Phy\uline{R}efine}, which decouples physical understanding from visual synthesis. Specifically, \textit{PhyReason} uses a large multimodal model for physical state reasoning and an image generator for keyframe synthesis; \textit{PhyPlan} deterministically synthesizes a controllable coarse motion scaffold; and \textit{PhyRefine} injects this scaffold into diffusion sampling via a latent fusion strategy to refine appearance while preserving the planned dynamics. This staged design enables explicit physical control during generation. Extensive experiments under physics constraints show that our method consistently improves physical plausibility and motion controllability.

Abstract: Delineating wildfire affected areas using satellite imagery remains challenging due to irregular and spatially heterogeneous spectral changes across the electromagnetic spectrum. While recent deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy when high-resolution multispectral data are available, their applicability in operational settings, where a quick delineation of the burn scar shortly after a wildfire incident is required, is limited by the trade-off between spatial resolution and temporal revisit frequency of current satellite systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning model, namely BAM-MRCD, which employs multi-resolution, multi-source satellite imagery (MODIS and Sentinel-2) for the timely production of detailed burnt area maps with high spatial and temporal resolution. Our model manages to detect even small scale wildfires with high accuracy, surpassing similar change detection models as well as solid baselines.

Conclusion: BrainSegNet通过结合SAM的可迁移特征和U-Net等精细化模块，实现了高精度多标签全脑分割，优于若干最先进方法并能处理复杂形状及边界。

Abstract: Whole-brain parcellation from MRI is a critical yet challenging task due to the complexity of subdividing the brain into numerous small, irregular shaped regions. Traditionally, template-registration methods were used, but recent advances have shifted to deep learning for faster workflows. While large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer transferable feature representations, they are not tailored for the high precision required in brain parcellation. To address this, we propose BrainSegNet, a novel framework that adapts SAM for accurate whole-brain parcellation into 95 regions. We enhance SAM by integrating U-Net skip connections and specialized modules into its encoder and decoder, enabling fine-grained anatomical precision. Key components include a hybrid encoder combining U-Net skip connections with SAM's transformer blocks, a multi-scale attention decoder with pyramid pooling for varying-sized structures, and a boundary refinement module to sharpen edges. Experimental results on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that BrainSegNet outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher accuracy and robustness in complex, multi-label parcellation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses limitations in 3D Gaussian Splatting for simulating brittle fracture due to lack of volumetric interiors and fracture-aware simulation methods.

Method: Densify internal Gaussians guided by generative models to produce textured interiors; integrate an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method for brittle fracture simulation; handle mixed materials and multi-stage fracture; render in real-time.

Result: They propose GaussianFluent which densifies internal Gaussians via generative models and integrates optimized CD-MPM for high-speed brittle fracture simulation; supports mixed materials and multi-stage fracture; enables photorealistic, real-time rendering with coherent interiors.

Conclusion: GaussianFluent successfully combines interior densification and fracture-aware simulation to achieve realistic, real-time fracture and rendering, enabling applications in VR and robotics.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent 3D representation for high-fidelity and real-time rendering. Prior work has coupled physics simulation with Gaussians, but predominantly targets soft, deformable materials, leaving brittle fracture largely unresolved. This stems from two key obstacles: the lack of volumetric interiors with coherent textures in GS representation, and the absence of fracture-aware simulation methods for Gaussians. To address these challenges, we introduce GaussianFluent, a unified framework for realistic simulation and rendering of dynamic object states. First, it synthesizes photorealistic interiors by densifying internal Gaussians guided by generative models. Second, it integrates an optimized Continuum Damage Material Point Method (CD-MPM) to enable brittle fracture simulation at remarkably high speed. Our approach handles complex scenarios including mixed-material objects and multi-stage fracture propagation, achieving results infeasible with previous methods. Experiments clearly demonstrate GaussianFluent's capability for photo-realistic, real-time rendering with structurally consistent interiors, highlighting its potential for downstream application, such as VR and Robotics.

Motivation: 传统文本解析方法缺乏图像说明能力，通用多模态大模型（MLLM）在特定领域的知识不足，故需构建具备领域知识和图像描述能力的专用模型。

Method: 三阶段训练：1) 使用Mermaid工具与LLM合成约7K图文对进行初始监督微调；2) ICT领域专家手工标注约2K图文对用于第二阶段监督微调；3) 专家与LLM联合合成约1.5K视觉问答数据进行指令式微调。构建了标准评估体系并与多个SOTA模型比较指标（如BLEU、准确率）。

Conclusion: 该文提出了在ICT领域中用于图像描述的多阶段渐进训练策略（DICModel），通过合成数据、人工注释和指令微调相结合，显著提升了小模型（7B）在域内图像理解和生成性能。

Abstract: In the information and communications technology (ICT) industry, training a domain-specific large language model (LLM) or constructing a retrieval-augmented generation system requires a substantial amount of high-value domain knowledge. However, the knowledge is not only hidden in the textual modality but also in the image modality. Traditional methods can parse text from domain documents but dont have image captioning ability. Multi-modal LLM (MLLM) can understand images, but they do not have sufficient domain knowledge. To address the above issues, this paper proposes a multi-stage progressive training strategy to train a Domain-specific Image Captioning Model (DICModel) in ICT, and constructs a standard evaluation system to validate the performance of DICModel. Specifically, this work first synthesizes about 7K image-text pairs by combining the Mermaid tool and LLMs, which are used for the first-stage supervised-fine-tuning (SFT) of DICModel. Then, ICT-domain experts manually annotate about 2K image-text pairs for the second-stage SFT of DICModel. Finally, experts and LLMs jointly synthesize about 1.5K visual question answering data for the instruction-based SFT. Experimental results indicate that our DICModel with only 7B parameters performs better than other state-of-the-art models with 32B parameters. Compared to the SOTA models with 7B and 32B parameters, our DICModel increases the BLEU metric by approximately 56.8% and 20.8%, respectively. On the objective questions constructed by ICT domain experts, our DICModel outperforms Qwen2.5-VL 32B by 1% in terms of accuracy rate. In summary, this work can efficiently and accurately extract the logical text from images, which is expected to promote the development of multimodal models in the ICT domain.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in clinical diagnostics, yet it remains hindered by long acquisition times and motion artifacts. Multi-contrast MRI reconstruction has emerged as a promising direction by leveraging complementary information from fully-sampled reference scans. However, existing approaches suffer from three major limitations: (1) superficial reference fusion strategies, such as simple concatenation, (2) insufficient utilization of the complementary information provided by the reference contrast, and (3) fixed under-sampling patterns. We propose an efficient and interpretable frequency error-guided reconstruction framework to tackle these issues. We first employ a conditional diffusion model to learn a Frequency Error Prior (FEP), which is then incorporated into a unified framework for jointly optimizing both the under-sampling pattern and the reconstruction network. The proposed reconstruction model employs a model-driven deep unfolding framework that jointly exploits frequency- and image-domain information. In addition, a spatial alignment module and a reference feature decomposition strategy are incorporated to improve reconstruction quality and bridge model-based optimization with data-driven learning for improved physical interpretability. Comprehensive validation across multiple imaging modalities, acceleration rates (4-30x), and sampling schemes demonstrates consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

Motivation: 传统线性探针通常只使用最后一层特征，然而任务相关信息分布在网络各层，尤其当下游任务与预训练域差异较大时，中间层信息更有用。因此需要一种方法利用跨层信息而保持计算与存储高效。

Conclusion: 本文结论是中间层表征对下游任务有重要价值，通过对 Vision Transformer 各层进行注意力加权融合的探针方法（attentive probing），在不微调骨干网络的情况下显著提升线性探针性能。

Abstract: With the rise of large-scale foundation models, efficiently adapting them to downstream tasks remains a central challenge. Linear probing, which freezes the backbone and trains a lightweight head, is computationally efficient but often restricted to last-layer representations. We show that task-relevant information is distributed across the network hierarchy rather than solely encoded in any of the last layers. To leverage this distribution of information, we apply an attentive probing mechanism that dynamically fuses representations from all layers of a Vision Transformer. This mechanism learns to identify the most relevant layers for a target task and combines low-level structural cues with high-level semantic abstractions. Across 20 diverse datasets and multiple pretrained foundation models, our method achieves consistent, substantial gains over standard linear probes. Attention heatmaps further reveal that tasks different from the pre-training domain benefit most from intermediate representations. Overall, our findings underscore the value of intermediate layer information and demonstrate a principled, task aware approach for unlocking their potential in probing-based adaptation.

Motivation: 视频任务因密集帧处理导致内存开销大，基于稀疏抽样的方法可能丢失关键信息，尤其对长视频。需要一种在受限内存下既保留信息又高效的框架。

Method: SMORE通过三步实现：1) 基于检索查询生成query-guided captions以对齐用户意图的语义；2) 使用query-aware importance modulation给相关片段分配更高权重；3) 采用自适应帧压缩在保留关键信息的同时压缩冗余帧。

Result: 在QVHighlights、Charades-STA和ActivityNet-Captions数据集上，SMORE取得了SOTA性能，证明其在效率与准确性间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: SMORE在保持高信息分辨率的同时极大提高了内存效率，从而在多项基准上实现了领先的时刻检索性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved image recognition and reasoning, but video-related tasks remain challenging due to memory constraints from dense frame processing. Existing Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methodologies rely on sparse frame sampling, risking potential information loss, especially in lengthy videos. We propose SMORE (See MORE, store less), a framework that enhances memory efficiency while maintaining high information resolution. SMORE (1) uses query-guided captions to encode semantics aligned with user intent, (2) applies query-aware importance modulation to highlight relevant segments, and (3) adaptively compresses frames to preserve key content while reducing redundancy. This enables efficient video understanding without exceeding memory budgets. Experimental validation reveals that SMORE achieves state-of-the-art performance on QVHighlights, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet-Captions benchmarks.

### [52] [Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning: A Fidelity-Guided Criterion for Extreme Structured Channel Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09352)
*Wei Liu,Xing Deng,Haijian Shao,Yingtao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCAP用频域自编码器重建复杂交互场的频谱，重建好者可剪，实验表明在激进压缩下保留较高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望在通道级别衡量功能冗余，找到能被低维谱流形紧凑表示的可压缩通道，从而更有效地进行激进剪枝。

Method: 对每层构造复数交互场：实部为完整输入通道激活，虚部为某单个输出通道激活（广播到输入通道），将其变换到频域，训练低容量自编码器重建归一化频谱，重建精度作为重要性评分，结合L1范数可阈值剪枝并保持结构一致性。

Result: 在VGG16/CIFAR-10上，阈值0.6时，实现90.11% FLOP减小、96.30%参数减小，微调后Top-1绝对降幅仅1.67%。

Conclusion: 本文提出SCAP，通过频谱重建保留信息量高的通道以实现剪枝，在CIFAR-10上能在激进压缩下保持较高精度。

Abstract: We propose Spectral Complex Autoencoder Pruning (SCAP), a reconstruction-based criterion that measures functional redundancy at the level of individual output channels. For each convolutional layer, we construct a complex interaction field by pairing the full multi-channel input activation as the real part with a single output-channel activation (spatially aligned and broadcast across input channels) as the imaginary part. We transform this complex field to the frequency domain and train a low-capacity autoencoder to reconstruct normalized spectra. Channels whose spectra are reconstructed with high fidelity are interpreted as lying close to a low-dimensional manifold captured by the autoencoder and are therefore more compressible; conversely, channels with low fidelity are retained as they encode information that cannot be compactly represented by the learned manifold. This yields an importance score (optionally fused with the filter L1 norm) that supports simple threshold-based pruning and produces a structurally consistent pruned network. On VGG16 trained on CIFAR-10, at a fixed threshold of 0.6, we obtain 90.11% FLOP reduction and 96.30% parameter reduction with an absolute Top-1 accuracy drop of 1.67% from a 93.44% baseline after fine-tuning, demonstrating that spectral reconstruction fidelity of complex interaction fields is an effective proxy for channel-level redundancy under aggressive compression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过拉普拉斯金字塔细节损失与重复上/下采样，强调高频成分，提升超分模型（包括CNN与注意力模型）的细节复原能力，实验证明达到了SOTA或明显改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升超分辨率图像中高频细节的恢复能力，以改善图像质量和应用性能。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 基于拉普拉斯金字塔的细节损失（detail loss），将超分图像分解为超分主图与细节图，分别计算总损失以强调高频分量；2) 反复上采样与下采样（repeated upscaling and downscaling），从多个低分辨率特征中提取多样化信息以增强细节损失效果。将这两者应用于自设计的CNN模型及小规模的注意力模型上。

Result: 在实验中：自设计的CNN模型结合所提方法取得了SOTA结果，超越了所有现有的CNN方法并优于部分注意力方法；将细节损失添加到注意力模型也在各项实验中提升了性能，证明方法对不同结构均有效。

Conclusion: 基于拉普拉斯金字塔的细节损失与反复上/下采样能显著加强模型对高频信息的关注，从而提升超分辨率图像质量，这些方法具有结构通用性并能提升现有模型表现。

Abstract: With advances in artificial intelligence, image processing has gained significant interest. Image super-resolution is a vital technology closely related to real-world applications, as it enhances the quality of existing images. Since enhancing fine details is crucial for the super-resolution task, pixels that contribute to high-frequency information should be emphasized. This paper proposes two methods to enhance high-frequency details in super-resolution images: a Laplacian pyramid-based detail loss and a repeated upscaling and downscaling process. Total loss with our detail loss guides a model by separately generating and controlling super-resolution and detail images. This approach allows the model to focus more effectively on high-frequency components, resulting in improved super-resolution images. Additionally, repeated upscaling and downscaling amplify the effectiveness of the detail loss by extracting diverse information from multiple low-resolution features. We conduct two types of experiments. First, we design a CNN-based model incorporating our methods. This model achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing all currently available CNN-based and even some attention-based models. Second, we apply our methods to existing attention-based models on a small scale. In all our experiments, attention-based models adding our detail loss show improvements compared to the originals. These results demonstrate our approaches effectively enhance super-resolution images across different model structures.

*Yaxi Chen,Zi Ye,Shaheer U. Saeed,Oliver Yu,Simin Ni,Jie Huang,Yipeng Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过图像组学+分层二分类（带可训练权重的分层损失），本文在患者级独立测试上显著提升了骨肉瘤坏死/可行区域自动识别的性能并提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对病人级独立测试集评估时，先前报道的基于patch/tiles的深度学习模型性能显著下降，说明单纯依赖像素级卷积特征泛化不足；引入影像组学和任务分层旨在增强泛化能力与可解释性并提升临床可信度。

Method: 首先提取图像衍生的影像组学特征并作为额外输入与卷积神经网络融合；其次将原先的三类任务拆分为两个层级二分类（肿瘤/非肿瘤、可行/不可行肿瘤），采用可训练权重的分层损失函数联合优化；在TCIA OS Tumor Assessment数据集上以患者级独立抽样的测试集评估并做消融实验。

Result: 在公开数据集上，单独使用影像组学或分层损失均能改善分类性能，二者结合时达到最佳效果，作者宣称在该任务上达到了新的开源数据集基准（state-of-the-art）；并提供代码与训练模型复现。

Conclusion: 本文提出将影像组学特征与深度学习模型多模态融合，并以分层的二分类任务替代平面三类分类，能够在患者级独立测试集上显著提升骨肉瘤活性/坏死区域的识别性能，从而提高自动化坏死率量化的可靠性。

Abstract: Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification. Evaluating on test data, independently sampled on patient-level, revealed that the deep learning model performance dropped significantly from the tile-level generalization ability reported in previous studies. First, this work proposes the use of radiomic features as additional input in model training. We show that, despite that they are derived from the images, such a multimodal input effectively improved the classification performance, in addition to its added benefits in interpretability. Second, this work proposes to optimize two binary classification tasks with hierarchical classes (i.e. tumor-vs-non-tumor and viable-vs-non-viable), as opposed to the alternative ``flat'' three-class classification task (i.e. non-tumor, non-viable tumor, viable tumor), thereby enabling a hierarchical loss. We show that such a hierarchical loss, with trainable weightings between the two tasks, the per-class performance can be improved significantly. Using the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset, we experimentally demonstrate the benefits from each of the proposed new approaches and their combination, setting a what we consider new state-of-the-art performance on this open dataset for this application.

*Rui Zhu,Xin Shen,Shuchen Wu,Chenxi Miao,Xin Yu,Yang Li,Weikang Li,Deguo Xia,Jizhou Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Video-MSR，一个用于视频中多跳空间推理（MSR）的基准，包含3052个视频与4993问答，设计四类任务并评测20个SOTA MLLM，发现多步推理表现显著下降；并提供MSR-9K指令调优数据与微调Qwen-VL提升7.82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多集中于单步感知判定，无法充分评估动态视频场景下需要多步视觉-空间逻辑推理的能力，因而需要专门的多跳空间推理评测。

Method: 构建视频数据集并设计四类MSR任务（受限定位、链式参考检索、路线规划、反事实物理推断）；利用大模型生成候选QA并经人工验证，形成高质量数据集；对20款模型进行全面评测；构建MSR-9K指令调优集并微调Qwen-VL。

Result: Video-MSR包含3052视频与4993问答，评测显示模型在MSR任务上性能明显下降并易出空间迷失与幻觉；微调后Qwen-VL在Video-MSR上提升7.82%。

Conclusion: 现有MMLLs在表层感知上表现尚可，但在多跳空间逻辑链上存在明显不足，Video-MSR能有效暴露并推动相关能力提升；使用MSR-9K指令微调可显著改善性能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), drawing increasing attention and rapid advancement. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on single-step perception-to-judgment tasks, leaving scenarios requiring complex visual-spatial logical chains significantly underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Video-MSR, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate Multi-hop Spatial Reasoning (MSR) in dynamic video scenarios. Video-MSR systematically probes MSR capabilities through four distinct tasks: Constrained Localization, Chain-based Reference Retrieval, Route Planning, and Counterfactual Physical Deduction. Our benchmark comprises 3,052 high-quality video instances with 4,993 question-answer pairs, constructed via a scalable, visually-grounded pipeline combining advanced model generation with rigorous human verification. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations, revealing that while models demonstrate proficiency in surface-level perception, they exhibit distinct performance drops in MSR tasks, frequently suffering from spatial disorientation and hallucination during multi-step deductions. To mitigate these shortcomings and empower models with stronger MSR capabilities, we further curate MSR-9K, a specialized instruction-tuning dataset, and fine-tune Qwen-VL, achieving a +7.82% absolute improvement on Video-MSR. Our results underscore the efficacy of multi-hop spatial instruction data and establish Video-MSR as a vital foundation for future research. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/ruiz-nju/Video-MSR.

Abstract: Automated analysis of ancient coins has the potential to help researchers extract more historical insights from large collections of coins and to help collectors understand what they are buying or selling. Recent research in this area has shown promise in focusing on identification of semantic elements as they are commonly depicted on ancient coins, by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This paper is the first to apply the recently proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) deep learning architecture to the task of identification of semantic elements on coins, using fully automatic learning from multi-modal data (images and unstructured text). This article summarises previous research in the area, discusses the training and implementation of ViT and CNN models for ancient coins analysis and provides an evaluation of their performance. The ViT models were found to outperform the newly trained CNN models in accuracy.

We demonstrate PrivLEX's ability to identify personal data concepts that are present in images. We further analyse the sensitivity of such concepts as perceived by human annotators of image privacy datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出将运动推理与外观渲染解耦的两阶段适配框架，极大提高将通用视频扩散模型转为可控驾驶世界模型的效率与可控性，实验证明在计算成本和效果上均领先开源方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用视频扩散模型生成逼真视频但缺乏作为自动驾驶世界模型所需的结构化运动与物理一致性；直接在驾驶域微调代价高且需大量领域数据，因此需要一种低成本、高效的适配方法。

Method: 两阶段流程：第一阶段在简化表示（骨架化的代理和场景元素视频）上训练模型以学习结构化运动，强调物理和社交合理性；第二阶段复用同一主干网络，根据这些运动序列合成逼真的RGB视频（“着色”运动），形成推理-渲染范式。作者在不同规模的基模型（如SVD、LTX）上验证了方法的高效性与可控性。

Result: 在SVD基线上，用不到先前SOTA模型6%的计算资源即可匹配效果；在LTX基线上，所提出的MAD-LTX超越所有开源竞品，并支持文本、车辆（ego）与目标对象等多种控制方式。

Conclusion: 该论文提出一种高效的适配框架，将通用视频扩散模型转为可控的驾驶世界模型，主要通过将运动学习与外观合成解耦，从而以极少的监督和计算资源实现物理与社会合理的动作预测并生成真实RGB视频。

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models generate photorealistic, temporally coherent videos, yet they fall short as reliable world models for autonomous driving, where structured motion and physically consistent interactions are essential. Adapting these generalist video models to driving domains has shown promise but typically requires massive domain-specific data and costly fine-tuning. We propose an efficient adaptation framework that converts generalist video diffusion models into controllable driving world models with minimal supervision. The key idea is to decouple motion learning from appearance synthesis. First, the model is adapted to predict structured motion in a simplified form: videos of skeletonized agents and scene elements, focusing learning on physical and social plausibility. Then, the same backbone is reused to synthesize realistic RGB videos conditioned on these motion sequences, effectively "dressing" the motion with texture and lighting. This two-stage process mirrors a reasoning-rendering paradigm: first infer dynamics, then render appearance. Our experiments show this decoupled approach is exceptionally efficient: adapting SVD, we match prior SOTA models with less than 6% of their compute. Scaling to LTX, our MAD-LTX model outperforms all open-source competitors, and supports a comprehensive suite of text, ego, and object controls.

*Ritabrata Chakraborty,Hrishit Mitra,Shivakumara Palaiahnakote,Umapada Pal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将数据集分为setting-agnostic与setting-specific，跨数据集检测在相同类型间迁移稳定，跨类型尤其从specific到agnostic迁移性能下降严重；标签对齐（CLIP映射）有帮助但无法完全消除领域差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中目标检测器在分布外表现差烈，需理解不同基准之间的迁移行为并给出评估与改进的实践建议，特别是区分因场景特异性和标签不一致导致的性能下降。

Method: 对若干代表性数据集按setting-specificity分组；用标准检测器家族在所有训练-测试组合上评估；设计open-label协议：用CLIP相似度将预测类别映射到目标标签，从而分离标签不匹配与领域差异的影响；比较closed-label与open-label结果并分析转移矩阵与不对称性。

Result: This paper analyzes cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) by grouping datasets into setting-agnostic and setting-specific, evaluating detector transfer across all train-test pairs. It finds stable transfer within same setting type but substantial, often asymmetric drops across types, worst when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets; domain shift dominates and open-label alignment gives limited gains. Dataset mapping via CLIP helps reveal label mismatches.

Conclusion: CD-OD受setting-specificity影响显著：同类场景间迁移稳健，异类间（特別是specific到agnostic）性能大幅下降且不对称；标签不匹配仅部分解释性能差距，领域差异是主要原因。

Abstract: Object detectors often perform well in-distribution, yet degrade sharply on a different benchmark. We study cross-dataset object detection (CD-OD) through a lens of setting specificity. We group benchmarks into setting-agnostic datasets with diverse everyday scenes and setting-specific datasets tied to a narrow environment, and evaluate a standard detector family across all train--test pairs. This reveals a clear structure in CD-OD: transfer within the same setting type is relatively stable, while transfer across setting types drops substantially and is often asymmetric. The most severe breakdowns occur when transferring from specific sources to agnostic targets, and persist after open-label alignment, indicating that domain shift dominates in the hardest regimes. To disentangle domain shift from label mismatch, we compare closed-label transfer with an open-label protocol that maps predicted classes to the nearest target label using CLIP similarity. Open-label evaluation yields consistent but bounded gains, and many corrected cases correspond to semantic near-misses supported by the image evidence. Overall, we provide a principled characterization of CD-OD under setting specificity and practical guidance for evaluating detectors under distribution shift. Code will be released at \href{[https://github.com/Ritabrata04/cdod-icpr.git}{https://github.com/Ritabrata04/cdod-icpr}.

*Edgar Sucar,Eldar Insafutdinov,Zihang Lai,Andrea Vedaldi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出V-DPM，将DPMs扩展到视频输入，通过在VGGT上用少量合成数据微调，实现无需后处理的动态深度与完整点级3D运动恢复，取得SOTA表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) from image pairs to video input to enable direct prediction of 3D motion over time without post-processing optimization, improving utility for dynamic scene reconstruction.

Method: Formulate video DPMs maximizing representational power and compatibility with pretrained models; implement on VGGT and fine-tune with limited synthetic dynamic data to predict DPMs directly from video frames.

Result: V-DPM: a video-capable DPM formulation implemented by adapting VGGT with synthetic data fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art 3D and 4D reconstruction and recovering full 3D motion of every scene point.

Conclusion: V-DPM successfully generalizes DPMs to videos, enabling neural network prediction of dynamic point maps and full per-point 3D motion; modest synthetic fine-tuning of a static-scene reconstructor suffices to reach state-of-the-art dynamic reconstruction.

Abstract: Powerful 3D representations such as DUSt3R invariant point maps, which encode 3D shape and camera parameters, have significantly advanced feed forward 3D reconstruction. While point maps assume static scenes, Dynamic Point Maps (DPMs) extend this concept to dynamic 3D content by additionally representing scene motion. However, existing DPMs are limited to image pairs and, like DUSt3R, require post processing via optimization when more than two views are involved. We argue that DPMs are more useful when applied to videos and introduce V-DPM to demonstrate this. First, we show how to formulate DPMs for video input in a way that maximizes representational power, facilitates neural prediction, and enables reuse of pretrained models. Second, we implement these ideas on top of VGGT, a recent and powerful 3D reconstructor. Although VGGT was trained on static scenes, we show that a modest amount of synthetic data is sufficient to adapt it into an effective V-DPM predictor. Our approach achieves state of the art performance in 3D and 4D reconstruction for dynamic scenes. In particular, unlike recent dynamic extensions of VGGT such as P3, DPMs recover not only dynamic depth but also the full 3D motion of every point in the scene.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频自监督预训练依赖像素级重建，容易捕捉背景等无关信息；改用嵌入级预测可促使模型关注语义性更强且与表情相关的特征，从而提升FER效果与泛化。

Method: 采用V-JEPA对视频编码器进行无监督预训练：随机mask视频区域并从未mask区域的嵌入预测被mask区域的嵌入；之后冻结或微调编码器，使用浅层分类器在RAVDESS和CREMA-D上训练与评测。

Result: V-JEPA用于面部表情识别，通过预测被mask区域的嵌入向量而非像素重建，从而学习忽略无关像素信息。使用预训练编码器在RAVDESS和CREMA-D上训练浅层分类器，在RAVDESS上达SOTA，在CREMA-D上领先其他视觉方法+1.48 WAR，且跨数据集泛化良好。代码已开源。

Conclusion: 纯嵌入预测的预训练（V-JEPA）能学到对表情识别有用且更具鲁棒性的编码器，推动FER性能并提高泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Video Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPAs) for Facial Expression Recognition (FER). Departing from conventional pre-training methods for video understanding that rely on pixel-level reconstructions, V-JEPAs learn by predicting embeddings of masked regions from the embeddings of unmasked regions. This enables the trained encoder to not capture irrelevant information about a given video like the color of a region of pixels in the background. Using a pre-trained V-JEPA video encoder, we train shallow classifiers using the RAVDESS and CREMA-D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on RAVDESS and outperforming all other vision-based methods on CREMA-D (+1.48 WAR). Furthermore, cross-dataset evaluations reveal strong generalization capabilities, demonstrating the potential of purely embedding-based pre-training approaches to advance FER. We release our code at https://github.com/lennarteingunia/vjepa-for-fer.

TL;DR: 通过构建层次化数据服务器并用二部图模式匹配为目标域每个模式挑选最优来源模式，得到更小域差的训练集，提升re-ID和检测任务的无监督域适应效果，可与现有UDA方法结合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当目标域可访问但无法实时标注时，希望从大规模数据服务器检索构建训练集；目标域通常呈多模态（语义簇），若训练集缺失某些目标模式会损害性能，因此需在服务器中找到覆盖目标模式的来源数据。

Method: 设计分层数据服务器（树形结构）并提出二部模式匹配算法（BMM），对目标域的每个模式在服务器树中寻找最优来源模式匹配，通过二分图一一匹配实现模式对齐，生成与目标域模式分布更接近的训练集；可与现有模型端UDA方法（如伪标签）结合。

Result: 经在目标识别（re-ID）和目标检测任务上实验，BMM搜到的训练集与目标域的域差更小，基于这些训练集训练的模型准确率显著提升；与模型端UDA方法联合能进一步提高性能。

Conclusion: 本论文提出通过优化数据服务器结构来构建更匹配目标域的训练集，从而提升无监督域适应下的模型性能。

Abstract: We explore a situation in which the target domain is accessible, but real-time data annotation is not feasible. Instead, we would like to construct an alternative training set from a large-scale data server so that a competitive model can be obtained. For this problem, because the target domain usually exhibits distinct modes (i.e., semantic clusters representing data distribution), if the training set does not contain these target modes, the model performance would be compromised. While prior existing works improve algorithms iteratively, our research explores the often-overlooked potential of optimizing the structure of the data server. Inspired by the hierarchical nature of web search engines, we introduce a hierarchical data server, together with a bipartite mode matching algorithm (BMM) to align source and target modes. For each target mode, we look in the server data tree for the best mode match, which might be large or small in size. Through bipartite matching, we aim for all target modes to be optimally matched with source modes in a one-on-one fashion. Compared with existing training set search algorithms, we show that the matched server modes constitute training sets that have consistently smaller domain gaps with the target domain across object re-identification (re-ID) and detection tasks. Consequently, models trained on our searched training sets have higher accuracy than those trained otherwise. BMM allows data-centric unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) orthogonal to existing model-centric UDA methods. By combining the BMM with existing UDA methods like pseudo-labeling, further improvement is observed.

### [64] [Hot-Start from Pixels: Low-Resolution Visual Tokens for Chinese Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09566)
*Shuyang Xiang,Hao Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文尝试用低分辨率的字符图像（如8x8灰度图）替代中文字符的离散索引作为解码器输入，发现性能接近索引基线并在训练初期收敛更快，说明字符的视觉结构能作为有效信号用于中文语言建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汉字作为表意文字，其视觉结构包含语义与语音线索，传统的索引令牌忽视了这些信息。研究旨在探索是否能用视觉信息作为字符级建模的替代或补充，以提高效率或在低资源设置下获得优势。

Method: 将每个中文字符渲染为低分辨率灰度图（最低8x8），并将这些图像直接输入解码器进行语言建模，比较与传统索引（token ID）模型的准确率和训练曲线，观察早期收敛（hot-start）现象和最终性能。

Result: 在8x8灰度图输入下，模型取得39.2%准确率，与索引基线39.1%相当；在训练的0.4%阶段即达到超过12%准确率，显著领先于索引模型的<6%，表明视觉输入能带来显著的早期性能提升。

Conclusion: 低分辨率视觉输入可替代传统的索引式字符表示，在中文语言建模中达到与索引基线相当的最终精度（39.2% vs 39.1%），且在训练早期表现更好（hot-start效应），证明视觉结构是有价值的补充或替代表征方式。

Abstract: Large language models typically represent Chinese characters as discrete index-based tokens, largely ignoring their visual form. For logographic scripts, visual structure carries semantic and phonetic information, which may aid prediction. We investigate whether low-resolution visual inputs can serve as an alternative for character-level modeling. Instead of token IDs, our decoder receives grayscale images of individual characters, with resolutions as low as $8 \times 8$ pixels. Remarkably, these inputs achieve 39.2\% accuracy, comparable to the index-based baseline of 39.1\%. Such low-resource settings also exhibit a pronounced \emph{hot-start} effect: by 0.4\% of total training, accuracy reaches above 12\%, while index-based models lag at below 6\%. Overall, our results demonstrate that minimal visual structure can provide a robust and efficient signal for Chinese language modeling, offering an alternative perspective on character representation that complements traditional index-based approaches.

*Tianli Tao,Ziyang Wang,Delong Yang,Han Zhang,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DF-DiffCom uses deformation fields via KAN-enhanced diffusion to complete longitudinal brain MRIs, yielding higher fidelity and flexibility across modalities, outperforming SOTA on OASIS-3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Longitudinal brain MRI has missing data due to attrition; existing deep generative models only use image intensity causing limited fidelity and restricted usage flexibility.

Method: Introduces DF-DiffCom: diffusion model enhanced with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks to leverage deformation fields; trained on OASIS-3; modality-agnostic approach allowing extension to segmentation maps and other MRI modalities.

Result: DF-DiffCom, a KAN-enhanced diffusion model using deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion, trained on OASIS-3, improves PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12; modality-agnostic and extends to varied MRI modalities and attribute maps.

Conclusion: Incorporating deformation fields and KAN into diffusion models yields more trustworthy, flexible longitudinal MRI completion, improving quantitative metrics and supporting modality-agnostic applications.

Abstract: Longitudinal brain MRI is essential for lifespan study, yet high attrition rates often lead to missing data, complicating analysis. Deep generative models have been explored, but most rely solely on image intensity, leading to two key limitations: 1) the fidelity or trustworthiness of the generated brain images are limited, making downstream studies questionable; 2) the usage flexibility is restricted due to fixed guidance rooted in the model structure, restricting full ability to versatile application scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DF-DiffCom, a Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)-enhanced diffusion model that smartly leverages deformation fields for trustworthy longitudinal brain image completion. Trained on OASIS-3, DF-DiffCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods, improving PSNR by 5.6% and SSIM by 0.12. More importantly, its modality-agnostic nature allows smooth extension to varied MRI modalities, even to attribute maps such as brain tissue segmentation results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出OpenVoxel：一个基于稀疏体素栅格和MLLM的训练-free分组与caption方法，可生成物体群组及其文本描述，支持开放词汇3D分割与指代表达分割，实验表明在RES等任务上优于近期方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一个无需训练的算法OpenVoxel，用于将稀疏体素分组并为其生成文本描述，以支持开放词汇的3D场景理解任务。目标是在不使用额外训练或文本编码器嵌入的情况下，利用已由多视图图像得到的稀疏体素栅格（SVR）模型，以及强大的视觉-语言模型（VLMs）和多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），实现物体分组、场景映射和开放词汇分割/指代表达分割任务。

Method: 基于SVR输出的稀疏体素表面，设计训练-free的分组策略生成表示不同物体的群组。随后利用VLM和MLLM进行文本到文本检索和描述生成（而非使用CLIP/BERT之类的文本编码器嵌入），对每个群组进行captioning，从而构建信息化的场景地图。最终通过映射群组与文本描述来支持OVS和RES等下游任务。

Result: 在大量实验中，OpenVoxel在若干任务上表现优异，尤其是在复杂的指代表达分割（RES）任务中，相比近期方法取得更好的性能。算法不需训练且无需引入文本编码器嵌入，但仍能生成有意义的分组与高质量描述。

Conclusion: OpenVoxel展示了通过结合SVR与强大的多模态语言模型，在无需训练的条件下也能实现有效的开放词汇3D场景理解和指代表达分割。代码将开源，有望推动零训练方法在3D理解场景的应用。

Abstract: We propose OpenVoxel, a training-free algorithm for grouping and captioning sparse voxels for the open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding tasks. Given the sparse voxel rasterization (SVR) model obtained from multi-view images of a 3D scene, our OpenVoxel is able to produce meaningful groups that describe different objects in the scene. Also, by leveraging powerful Vision Language Models (VLMs) and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), our OpenVoxel successfully build an informative scene map by captioning each group, enabling further 3D scene understanding tasks such as open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) or referring expression segmentation (RES). Unlike previous methods, our method is training-free and does not introduce embeddings from a CLIP/BERT text encoder. Instead, we directly proceed with text-to-text search using MLLMs. Through extensive experiments, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to recent studies, particularly in complex referring expression segmentation (RES) tasks. The code will be open.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于微分熵的对称配准目标（IDEM），在细致刚性点云配准任务中比RMSE等欧氏距离指标更鲁棒，能处理密度差、噪声、孔洞及部分重叠问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point cloud registration methods based on Euclidean distances (RMSE, Chamfer, Hausdorff) fail when point clouds have density differences, noise, holes, or partial overlap, and require choosing a fixed cloud—lack commutativity. The paper introduces a differential entropy-based metric to address these issues.

Method: 将两点云视为连续概率分布，利用微分熵计算重合程度，构建可微的目标函数并在刚性变换空间中进行迭代优化（IDEM），对比RMSE、Chamfer和Hausdorff进行多组案例实验。

Result: A new differential entropy-based metric within an optimization framework (IDEM) that is symmetric (does not depend on choosing a fixed cloud) and exhibits a clear minimum at best alignment. Experiments show IDEM outperforms RMSE under density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap.

Conclusion: 微分熵度量为点云配准提供了更鲁棒的目标函数，避免了选择固定点云的限制，实验证明在多种困难情况下均能更好地定位最佳对齐。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a central theme in computer vision, with alignment algorithms continuously improving for greater robustness. Commonly used methods evaluate Euclidean distances between point clouds and minimize an objective function, such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). However, these approaches are most effective when the point clouds are well-prealigned and issues such as differences in density, noise, holes, and limited overlap can compromise the results. Traditional methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), require choosing one point cloud as fixed, since Euclidean distances lack commutativity. When only one point cloud has issues, adjustments can be made, but in real scenarios, both point clouds may be affected, often necessitating preprocessing. The authors introduce a novel differential entropy-based metric, designed to serve as the objective function within an optimization framework for fine rigid pairwise 3D point cloud registration, denoted as Iterative Differential Entropy Minimization (IDEM). This metric does not depend on the choice of a fixed point cloud and, during transformations, reveals a clear minimum corresponding to the best alignment. Multiple case studies are conducted, and the results are compared with those obtained using RMSE, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance. The proposed metric proves effective even with density differences, noise, holes, and partial overlap, where RMSE does not always yield optimal alignment.

*Jeremiah Coholich,Justin Wit,Robert Azarcon,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANGO translates simulated robot images to realistic unseen viewpoints using a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE and regularized discriminator, improving imitation policy performance on novel views (up to 60% success).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic vision policies fail under camera viewpoint shifts; real-world demo data lacks viewpoint diversity; simulation can provide diverse viewpoints but visual gap (sim2real) hinders direct use.

Method: Unpaired image translation from sim to real with three key components: segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, highly-regularized discriminator architecture, and modified PatchNCE loss; train using small fixed-camera real dataset and diverse simulated viewpoints; generate translated images for augmentation and train imitation policies.

Result: MANGO, an unpaired image translation method with segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, regularized discriminator, and modified PatchNCE loss, preserves viewpoint consistency and produces realistic translations of simulated views using only limited fixed-camera real data.

Conclusion: MANGO effectively bridges sim-to-real for viewpoint augmentation; policies trained with MANGO-augmented data significantly improve robustness to novel camera viewpoints compared to other translation baselines.

Abstract: Vision-based policies for robot manipulation have achieved significant recent success, but are still brittle to distribution shifts such as camera viewpoint variations. Robot demonstration data is scarce and often lacks appropriate variation in camera viewpoints. Simulation offers a way to collect robot demonstrations at scale with comprehensive coverage of different viewpoints, but presents a visual sim2real challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose MANGO -- an unpaired image translation method with a novel segmentation-conditioned InfoNCE loss, a highly-regularized discriminator design, and a modified PatchNCE loss. We find that these elements are crucial for maintaining viewpoint consistency during sim2real translation. When training MANGO, we only require a small amount of fixed-camera data from the real world, but show that our method can generate diverse unseen viewpoints by translating simulated observations. In this domain, MANGO outperforms all other image translation methods we tested. Imitation-learning policies trained on data augmented by MANGO are able to achieve success rates as high as 60\% on views that the non-augmented policy fails completely on.

### [70] [GRCF: Two-Stage Groupwise Ranking and Calibration Framework for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09606)
*Manning Gao,Leheng Zhang,Shiqin Han,Haifeng Hu,Yuncheng Jiang,Sijie Mai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRCF: a two-stage method—advantage-weighted dynamic-margin ranking for preserving fine-grained ordinal relations, then MAE calibration for absolute score alignment—improves robustness and correlation, achieving SOTA and generalizing to classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point-wise regression is sensitive to label noise and ignores relative ordering; pairwise ordinal methods capture order but treat all comparisons equally and use static margins, failing to focus hard samples and reflect semantic distances.

Method: Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) combining advantage-weighted dynamic margin ranking and MAE calibration

Result: Introduces GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss (Stage 1) and MAE-driven calibration (Stage 2); achieves SOTA on regression benchmarks and generalizes to classification tasks like humor and sarcasm detection.

Conclusion: GRCF effectively balances relative ranking and absolute calibration, adaptively focuses on hard-to-rank samples, and yields improved performance across multimodal sentiment regression and related classification tasks.

Abstract: Most Multimodal Sentiment Analysis research has focused on point-wise regression. While straightforward, this approach is sensitive to label noise and neglects whether one sample is more positive than another, resulting in unstable predictions and poor correlation alignment. Pairwise ordinal learning frameworks emerged to address this gap, capturing relative order by learning from comparisons. Yet, they introduce two new trade-offs: First, they assign uniform importance to all comparisons, failing to adaptively focus on hard-to-rank samples. Second, they employ static ranking margins, which fail to reflect the varying semantic distances between sentiment groups. To address this, we propose a Two-Stage Group-wise Ranking and Calibration Framework (GRCF) that adapts the philosophy of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our framework resolves these trade-offs by simultaneously preserving relative ordinal structure, ensuring absolute score calibration, and adaptively focusing on difficult samples. Specifically, Stage 1 introduces a GRPO-inspired Advantage-Weighted Dynamic Margin Ranking Loss to build a fine-grained ordinal structure. Stage 2 then employs an MAE-driven objective to align prediction magnitudes. To validate its generalizability, we extend GRCF to classification tasks, including multimodal humor detection and sarcasm detection. GRCF achieves state-of-the-art performance on core regression benchmarks, while also showing strong generalizability in classification tasks.

TL;DR: Introduces CogRail benchmark for cognitive intrusion perception, evaluates and fine-tunes VLMs, and proposes joint multi-task fine-tuning, showing improved adaptation while revealing limitations of existing foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The motivation is to improve railway intrusion detection by enabling cognitive spatio-temporal reasoning beyond static object classification and rule heuristics.

Method: They create CogRail benchmark, evaluate VLMs with multimodal prompts, fine-tune VLMs, and propose a joint fine-tuning framework integrating position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis.

Result: Current large-scale multimodal models struggle with spatio-temporal reasoning in this domain; joint fine-tuning framework significantly improves performance and interpretability.

Conclusion: Structured multi-task fine-tuning enables foundation models to better handle domain-specific spatio-temporal reasoning for railway intrusion perception, but significant gaps remain in current VLM capabilities.

Abstract: Accurate and early perception of potential intrusion targets is essential for ensuring the safety of railway transportation systems. However, most existing systems focus narrowly on object classification within fixed visual scopes and apply rule-based heuristics to determine intrusion status, often overlooking targets that pose latent intrusion risks. Anticipating such risks requires the cognition of spatial context and temporal dynamics for the object of interest (OOI), which presents challenges for conventional visual models. To facilitate deep intrusion perception, we introduce a novel benchmark, CogRail, which integrates curated open-source datasets with cognitively driven question-answer annotations to support spatio-temporal reasoning and prediction. Building upon this benchmark, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art visual-language models (VLMs) using multimodal prompts to identify their strengths and limitations in this domain. Furthermore, we fine-tune VLMs for better performance and propose a joint fine-tuning framework that integrates three core tasks, position perception, movement prediction, and threat analysis, facilitating effective adaptation of general-purpose foundation models into specialized models tailored for cognitive intrusion perception. Extensive experiments reveal that current large-scale multimodal models struggle with the complex spatial-temporal reasoning required by the cognitive intrusion perception task, underscoring the limitations of existing foundation models in this safety-critical domain. In contrast, our proposed joint fine-tuning framework significantly enhances model performance by enabling targeted adaptation to domain-specific reasoning demands, highlighting the advantages of structured multi-task learning in improving both accuracy and interpretability. Code will be available at https://github.com/Hub-Tian/CogRail.

TL;DR: 论文通过质心基线在嵌入空间成功去匿名化 T2I 模型生成图像，证明排行榜匿名机制易被突破，建议加强匿名化防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着 T2I 模型普及，投票式排行榜成为比较模型质量的标准，但排行榜依赖于对模型输出的匿名化以保持公平性，作者质疑并验证了这种匿名性是否可靠。

Method: 作者收集了22个模型、280个提示词、约15万张生成图像，基于图像嵌入计算每个模型的质心并进行最近质心分类，提出质心为基础的简单去匿名化方法；还定义提示级可区分性度量并进行大规模分析。

Result: 质心方法在数据集中取得高准确率，揭示系统性的模型特征；某些提示词能导致近乎完美的可区分性，表明匿名化防护目前不足。

Conclusion: 该论文表明基于投票的无名 T2I 排行榜存在根本性安全缺陷，模型生成图像在嵌入空间呈现出可区分的簇，从而可被去匿名化。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly popular, producing a large share of AI-generated images online. To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space, enabling accurate deanonymization without prompt control or training data. Using 22 models and 280 prompts (150K images), our centroid-based method achieves high accuracy and reveals systematic model-specific signatures. We further introduce a prompt-level distinguishability metric and conduct large-scale analyses showing how certain prompts can lead to near-perfect distinguishability. Our findings expose fundamental security flaws in T2I leaderboards and motivate stronger anonymization defenses.

Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖多视角捕捉和昂贵的可微分仿真进行优化，要么只能预测几何而无法得到仿真所需的物理材料参数；同时缺乏图像到物理参数的大规模数据集。为此，作者提出通过结合视觉-语言微调与小样本物理测量映射来弥补数据缺口与计算开销。

Method: 方法分两步：1) 在视觉-语言模型上进行微调，使其从真实图像推断材质组成和面料属性；2) 训练一个轻量的物理参数预测器，将预测到的属性映射到物理面料参数，使用小规模材料-物理测量数据集进行监督。引入了两个新数据集（FTAG和T2P），并在无需多视角或可微分仿真的前提下实现从单图到仿真就绪服装的生成。

Result: 作者构建的估计器在材质组成识别和面料属性预测上优于现有方法，并通过物理参数估计器得到的参数在物理仿真中展现出比现有单图到服装方法更高的保真度。提出的数据集（FTAG、T2P）有助于训练和评估。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个端到端、无需迭代优化的单张图像到可用于物理仿真的服装估计框架，能够同时预测材质组成、面料属性和物理参数，从而生成高保真可仿真服装。

Abstract: Estimating physically accurate, simulation-ready garments from a single image is challenging due to the absence of image-to-physics datasets and the ill-posed nature of this problem. Prior methods either require multi-view capture and expensive differentiable simulation or predict only garment geometry without the material properties required for realistic simulation. We propose a feed-forward framework that sidesteps these limitations by first fine-tuning a vision-language model to infer material composition and fabric attributes from real images, and then training a lightweight predictor that maps these attributes to the corresponding physical fabric parameters using a small dataset of material-physics measurements. Our approach introduces two new datasets (FTAG and T2P) and delivers simulation-ready garments from a single image without iterative optimization. Experiments show that our estimator achieves superior accuracy in material composition estimation and fabric attribute prediction, and by passing them through our physics parameter estimator, we further achieve higher-fidelity simulations compared to state-of-the-art image-to-garment methods.

TL;DR: LiteEmbed：在 CLIP 词表子空间中用 PCA 引导的轻量优化，联合粗对齐与细分离目标，为少样本新类生成可插拔文本嵌入，显著提升对罕见/未见类别的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP 在零样本下对常见类别表现良好，但对预训练中罕见或未见过的类别（如新兴实体或文化特定类别）效果差；希望用一种轻量、无需重训练编码器的方法，为 CLIP 快速添加新类并提升少样本识别性能。

Method: 基于 PCA 将 CLIP 词向量空间分解为粗语义方向与细粒度变化子空间，在此子空间内对文本嵌入进行约束优化；优化目标由“粗对齐”（保持全局语义一致性）与“细分离”（增强相似类别间可分辨性）两部分构成；优化后嵌入可即插即用替换 CLIP 原始文本特征，无需重训练视觉或文本编码器。

Result: 大量实验显示 LiteEmbed 在多个任务上显著优于先前方法，对罕见、欠代表或未见类别的识别能力有大幅提升，并证明其在分类、检索、分割和检测场景的泛化性与实用性。

Conclusion: LiteEmbed 能在不重训练编码器的情况下，通过对 CLIP 文本嵌入在词表子空间内的轻量优化，实现对少样本/新兴/文化特定类别的个性化扩展，从而在分类、检索、分割和检测等任务上显著提升对罕见类的识别性能。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but struggle with classes that are rarely seen during pretraining, including newly emerging entities and culturally specific categories. We introduce LiteEmbed, a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables new classes to be added without retraining its encoders. LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes.

TL;DR: 将长期动物识别转为固定个体数的全局聚类，自监督、低显存、无需人工标签，达成或超过有监督精度（>97%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需大量人工标注或内存密集的对比学习/跟踪策略，不适合长视频和资源受限场景，故提出一种高效且无需标签的识别框架。

Method: 输入为每帧检测框和已知个体数；采样帧对并用冻结的预训练骨干提取特征；在小批量内用匈牙利算法进行伪标签分配与自举；使用改编的二元交叉熵损失（来自视觉-语言模型）进行训练；不依赖时序一致性，内存占用低。

Result: 提出一种高效自监督个体识别方法，将识别任务视为全局聚类而非时序跟踪，假设视频中个体数固定已知，仅需边界框和总数，通过采样帧对、冻结预训练骨干、匈牙利算法批内伪标签分配和自举机制学习判别特征，并改用类似视觉-语言模型的二元交叉熵损失，实现>97%精度且每批显存<1GB，在3D-POP鸽子和8只小牛喂食数据集上超越/匹配监督基线，并公布代码。

Conclusion: 所提方法在假设固定个体数的条件下，能在资源受限硬件上实现高精度动物个体识别，显著减少人工标注成本并具备广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Identifying individual animals in long-duration videos is essential for behavioral ecology, wildlife monitoring, and livestock management. Traditional methods require extensive manual annotation, while existing self-supervised approaches are computationally demanding and ill-suited for long sequences due to memory constraints and temporal error propagation. We introduce a highly efficient, self-supervised method that reframes animal identification as a global clustering task rather than a sequential tracking problem. Our approach assumes a known, fixed number of individuals within a single video -- a common scenario in practice -- and requires only bounding box detections and the total count. By sampling pairs of frames, using a frozen pre-trained backbone, and employing a self-bootstrapping mechanism with the Hungarian algorithm for in-batch pseudo-label assignment, our method learns discriminative features without identity labels. We adapt a Binary Cross Entropy loss from vision-language models, enabling state-of-the-art accuracy ($>$97\%) while consuming less than 1 GB of GPU memory per batch -- an order of magnitude less than standard contrastive methods. Evaluated on challenging real-world datasets (3D-POP pigeons and 8-calves feeding videos), our framework matches or surpasses supervised baselines trained on over 1,000 labeled frames, effectively removing the manual annotation bottleneck. This work enables practical, high-accuracy animal identification on consumer-grade hardware, with broad applicability in resource-constrained research settings.

Motivation: 单目SLAM在资源受限平台和互联网视频中广泛应用，但帧对帧方法缺乏全局尺度约束，导致随时间积累的尺度漂移。需在保持实时性的同时引入全局尺度一致性约束。

Result: 在KITTI、Waymo和vKITTI数据集上进行实验，结果显示在保持36 FPS实时性的同时显著降低轨迹绝对误差。在KITTI上相比最优先前方法减少绝对轨迹误差8.36米，并在大尺度场景中实现尺度一致性。

Conclusion: 该文章提出通过场景坐标嵌入（scene coordinate embeddings）在单目视觉SLAM中维持尺度一致性，从而减少长期序列中的尺度漂移问题。

Abstract: Monocular visual SLAM enables 3D reconstruction from internet video and autonomous navigation on resource-constrained platforms, yet suffers from scale drift, i.e., the gradual divergence of estimated scale over long sequences. Existing frame-to-frame methods achieve real-time performance through local optimization but accumulate scale drift due to the lack of global constraints among independent windows. To address this, we propose SCE-SLAM, an end-to-end SLAM system that maintains scale consistency through scene coordinate embeddings, which are learned patch-level representations encoding 3D geometric relationships under a canonical scale reference. The framework consists of two key modules: geometry-guided aggregation that leverages 3D spatial proximity to propagate scale information from historical observations through geometry-modulated attention, and scene coordinate bundle adjustment that anchors current estimates to the reference scale through explicit 3D coordinate constraints decoded from the scene coordinate embeddings. Experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and vKITTI demonstrate substantial improvements: our method reduces absolute trajectory error by 8.36m on KITTI compared to the best prior approach, while maintaining 36 FPS and achieving scale consistency across large-scale scenes.

TL;DR: STEP3-VL-10B 通过统一预训练、强化后训练与并行协同推理，在仅10B参数下实现超越或匹配百B级模型的多模态智能性能，并开源模型供社区使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在保持模型小巧（10B参数）和计算高效的前提下，追求或超越大规模（数十到上百B参数）多模态模型的能力，提供一个开源且可复现的高效基线。

Method: 采用两步策略：1) 在1.2T多模态token上进行统一且完全不冻结的预训练，将语言对齐的感知编码器与Qwen3-8B解码器整合以建立视觉-语言内在协同；2) 进行超过1000次迭代的强化学习式后训练，并在推理阶段引入PaCoRe（并行协同推理）以扩展感知推理计算，探索并综合多种视觉假设。

Result: 在公开基准上取得领先成绩：MMBench 92.2%、MMMU 80.11%、AIME2025 94.43%、MathVision 75.95%，并在对比测试中超越如GLM-4.6V-106B、Qwen3-VL-235B以及部分私有旗鼓相当的模型。

Conclusion: STEP3-VL-10B 在小模型参数下通过统一预训练与大规模后训练并结合并行协同推理，实现了与更大模型相当或更好性能，展示出高效的视觉语言推理能力。

Abstract: We present STEP3-VL-10B, a lightweight open-source foundation model designed to redefine the trade-off between compact efficiency and frontier-level multimodal intelligence. STEP3-VL-10B is realized through two strategic shifts: first, a unified, fully unfrozen pre-training strategy on 1.2T multimodal tokens that integrates a language-aligned Perception Encoder with a Qwen3-8B decoder to establish intrinsic vision-language synergy; and second, a scaled post-training pipeline featuring over 1k iterations of reinforcement learning. Crucially, we implement Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe) to scale test-time compute, allocating resources to scalable perceptual reasoning that explores and synthesizes diverse visual hypotheses. Consequently, despite its compact 10B footprint, STEP3-VL-10B rivals or surpasses models 10$\times$-20$\times$ larger (e.g., GLM-4.6V-106B, Qwen3-VL-235B) and top-tier proprietary flagships like Gemini 2.5 Pro and Seed-1.5-VL. Delivering best-in-class performance, it records 92.2% on MMBench and 80.11% on MMMU, while excelling in complex reasoning with 94.43% on AIME2025 and 75.95% on MathVision. We release the full model suite to provide the community with a powerful, efficient, and reproducible baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出SRENDER：用扩散模型只生成关键帧，基于3D重建和渲染补齐中间帧，并用一个预测器自适应选择关键帧数量，实现比纯扩散方法快40x以上且保持高质量的视频合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成视频虽质量高但计算耗时大，不适合实时或交互应用；通过降低生成帧数并利用3D渲染保持几何一致性来提升效率。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成关键帧，将关键帧提升为3D表示（可能基于NeRF或多视图几何），对中间帧进行渲染；引入一个预测模型自适应地决定关键帧数量，以根据相机轨迹复杂度分配计算资源；最终系统SRENDER在简单轨迹使用很稀疏关键帧，在复杂轨迹使用更密集的关键帧。

Result: 在生成20秒视频时，比扩散基线快40倍以上，同时保持高视觉保真度和时间稳定性；模型能根据轨迹复杂性动态调整关键帧密度。

Conclusion: 提出通过生成稀疏关键帧并基于3D重建与渲染合成中间帧，以显著降低扩散模型视频生成的计算成本，同时保持视觉质量和时间一致性。

Abstract: Modern video generative models based on diffusion models can produce very realistic clips, but they are computationally inefficient, often requiring minutes of GPU time for just a few seconds of video. This inefficiency poses a critical barrier to deploying generative video in applications that require real-time interactions, such as embodied AI and VR/AR. This paper explores a new strategy for camera-conditioned video generation of static scenes: using diffusion-based generative models to generate a sparse set of keyframes, and then synthesizing the full video through 3D reconstruction and rendering. By lifting keyframes into a 3D representation and rendering intermediate views, our approach amortizes the generation cost across hundreds of frames while enforcing geometric consistency. We further introduce a model that predicts the optimal number of keyframes for a given camera trajectory, allowing the system to adaptively allocate computation. Our final method, SRENDER, uses very sparse keyframes for simple trajectories and denser ones for complex camera motion. This results in video generation that is more than 40 times faster than the diffusion-based baseline in generating 20 seconds of video, while maintaining high visual fidelity and temporal stability, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable video synthesis.

*Tony Danjun Wang,Tolga Birdal,Nassir Navab,Lennart Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COMPOSE通过超图划分和几何剪枝在多视角关键点匹配上引入高阶一致性约束，显著提升了3D姿态估计精度并保持可计算性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅用成对关联并将全局一致性作为软约束，容易在多视角下由于错误传播导致脆弱匹配，需一种能显式建模高阶一致性的稳健方法。

Method: 提出将匹配问题转为整数线性规划形式的超图划分，并设计几何剪枝策略来大幅缩减搜索空间，使得理论上指数复杂度在实际中可行；采用超边建模多视图间高阶一致性以强化全局循环一致性约束。

Result: 在若干基准上，COMPOSE相较于先前优化方法平均精度提升最多23%，并比自监督端到端学习方法提升最多11%，表明该方法在稀疏多视角场景下具有明显优势。

Conclusion: COMPOSE通过将多视角关键点匹配建模为超图划分问题，克服了以往基于两两关联方法易受错误传播影响的问题，在稀疏多视角3D姿态估计上显著提升了匹配精度。

Abstract: 3D pose estimation from sparse multi-views is a critical task for numerous applications, including action recognition, sports analysis, and human-robot interaction. Optimization-based methods typically follow a two-stage pipeline, first detecting 2D keypoints in each view and then associating these detections across views to triangulate the 3D pose. Existing methods rely on mere pairwise associations to model this correspondence problem, treating global consistency between views (i.e., cycle consistency) as a soft constraint. Yet, reconciling these constraints for multiple views becomes brittle when spurious associations propagate errors. We thus propose COMPOSE, a novel framework that formulates multi-view pose correspondence matching as a hypergraph partitioning problem rather than through pairwise association. While the complexity of the resulting integer linear program grows exponentially in theory, we introduce an efficient geometric pruning strategy to substantially reduce the search space. COMPOSE achieves improvements of up to 23% in average precision over previous optimization-based methods and up to 11% over self-supervised end-to-end learned methods, offering a promising solution to a widely studied problem.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出无训练的SAM3-DMS，通过对每个目标进行解耦的细粒度记忆选择，提高多目标视频分割的身份保留和跟踪稳定性，密集目标场景下效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始SAM3在多目标场景下采用群体同步的记忆选择策略，基于并发目标的平均表现做决策，导致在复杂场景中忽略个体可靠性，从而影响跟踪和身份保持。

Method: 提出一种无需训练的解耦策略，对每个目标执行细粒度记忆选择，从而避免原始SAM3在群体级别记忆选择中因以平均性能为条件而忽视个体可靠性的问题。

Result: 实验表明，SAM3-DMS在身份保持和跟踪稳定性方面表现更好，且随着目标密度增加，优势更加明显，为野外多目标同时视频分割奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SAM3-DMS通过对多目标视频分割中的记忆选择进行解耦，提升了身份保留和跟踪稳定性，尤其在目标密集场景中效果更突出。

Abstract: Segment Anything 3 (SAM3) has established a powerful foundation that robustly detects, segments, and tracks specified targets in videos. However, in its original implementation, its group-level collective memory selection is suboptimal for complex multi-object scenarios, as it employs a synchronized decision across all concurrent targets conditioned on their average performance, often overlooking individual reliability. To this end, we propose SAM3-DMS, a training-free decoupled strategy that utilizes fine-grained memory selection on individual objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves robust identity preservation and tracking stability. Notably, our advantage becomes more pronounced with increased target density, establishing a solid foundation for simultaneous multi-target video segmentation in the wild.

TL;DR: Fast-ThinkAct distills latent chain-of-thoughts into compact verbalizable representations for fast reasoning and planning in vision-language-action tasks, achieving major inference speedups while keeping strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce high inference latency of explicit chain-of-thought reasoning in VLA tasks while preserving planning and adaptation capabilities.

Method: Summarize methods: proposes Fast-ThinkAct, latent CoTs distilled from teacher with preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories; connects reasoning to policy learning for embodied control.

Result: Experiments on embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks show strong performance, up to 89.3% reduced inference latency, maintains long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, failure recovery.

Conclusion: Fast-ThinkAct provides compact verbalizable latent reasoning enabling efficient planning and action execution, balancing reasoning quality and inference speed for VLA tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact yet performant planning through verbalizable latent reasoning. Fast-ThinkAct learns to reason efficiently with latent CoTs by distilling from a teacher, driven by a preference-guided objective to align manipulation trajectories that transfers both linguistic and visual planning capabilities for embodied control. This enables reasoning-enhanced policy learning that effectively connects compact reasoning to action execution. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied manipulation and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-ThinkAct achieves strong performance with up to 89.3\% reduced inference latency over state-of-the-art reasoning VLAs, while maintaining effective long-horizon planning, few-shot adaptation, and failure recovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决精神科入院评估中数据稀缺和患者不诚实时影响评估准确性的问题，通过建模患者欺瞒行为生成可公开发布的高保真合成记录。

Method: 基于DAIC-WOZ访谈数据扩展患者档案，定义四角色（Patient/Assessor/Evaluator/Diagnostician）并按流程生成病例；通过诊断一致性、Chain-of-thought消融、人类临床现实性评价和LLM比较评估进行验证。

Result: 提出一个多智能体合成框架，从实际访谈构建丰富患者档案，模拟患者、评估者、面试者和诊断者四角色流程，输出包含自评、他评、访谈文本、诊断摘要与诚实状态的病例语料库。

Conclusion: 该框架可生成跨病种和严重程度的高质量合成病例，经过多维评估证明在诊断一致性、严重度划分及不诚实建模上具有实用性，促进不诚实感知评估和自适应对话系统的发展。

Abstract: Data scarcity and unreliable self-reporting -- such as concealment or exaggeration -- pose fundamental challenges to psychiatric intake and assessment. We propose a multi-agent synthesis framework that explicitly models patient deception to generate high-fidelity, publicly releasable synthetic psychiatric intake records. Starting from DAIC-WOZ interviews, we construct enriched patient profiles and simulate a four-role workflow: a \emph{Patient} completes self-rated scales and participates in a semi-structured interview under a topic-dependent honesty state; an \emph{Assessor} selects instruments based on demographics and chief complaints; an \emph{Evaluator} conducts the interview grounded in rater-administered scales, tracks suspicion, and completes ratings; and a \emph{Diagnostician} integrates all evidence into a diagnostic summary. Each case links the patient profile, self-rated and rater-administered responses, interview transcript, diagnostic summary, and honesty state. We validate the framework through four complementary evaluations: diagnostic consistency and severity grading, chain-of-thought ablations, human evaluation of clinical realism and dishonesty modeling, and LLM-based comparative evaluation. The resulting corpus spans multiple disorders and severity levels, enabling controlled study of dishonesty-aware psychiatric assessment and the training and evaluation of adaptive dialogue agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable automated, cross-domain SQL exploratory data analysis using LLMs and GUI to make exploration accessible

Method: Describe system TiInsight and its components

Result: A deployed production system with HDC generation, question clarification/decomposition, TiSQL, TiChart, and demo video; showed capability on representative datasets at PingCAP

Conclusion: TiInsight advances automated cross-domain EDA by integrating LLMs with structured pipelines and GUI, but paper should further evaluate cross-domain generalization and LLM limitations.

Abstract: The SQL-based exploratory data analysis has garnered significant attention within the data analysis community. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has facilitated the paradigm shift from manual to automated data exploration. However, existing methods generally lack the ability for cross-domain analysis, and the exploration of LLMs capabilities remains insufficient. This paper presents TiInsight, an SQL-based automated cross-domain exploratory data analysis system. First, TiInsight offers a user-friendly GUI enabling users to explore data using natural language queries. Second, TiInsight offers a robust cross-domain exploratory data analysis pipeline: hierarchical data context (i.e., HDC) generation, question clarification and decomposition, text-to-SQL (i.e., TiSQL), and data visualization (i.e., TiChart). Third, we have implemented and deployed TiInsight in the production environment of PingCAP and demonstrated its capabilities using representative datasets. The demo video is available at https://youtu.be/JzYFyYd-emI.
