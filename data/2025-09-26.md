Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉-语言模型（VLM）逐词预测概率（next-token probabilities, NTPs）的轻量级现场（on-the-fly）幻觉检测方法。作者构建了1400条人工标注的VLM生成语句数据集，验证了低NTP对应高不确定性与幻觉高度相关。将基于视觉+语言的NTP与仅语言的NTP结合，以及融合VLM自身的幻觉评分，可进一步提升检测性能，且简单ML模型可达到与强VLM相当的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用VLM自身或另一个模型检测幻觉的方法计算量大、延迟高。本研究寻求一种低开销、实时可用的幻觉检测方法，利用模型内部的预测置信度（NTPs）快速识别幻觉，从而提高VLM在实用场景中的可靠性。

Method: 收集并标注1400条VLM生成语句为幻觉或非幻觉；从VLM提取视觉-语言的逐词预测概率（NTPs）作为不确定性信号；计算语言-only NTPs（仅将生成文本输入VLM）作为补充特征；用轻量级传统机器学习模型（如逻辑回归、树模型）训练和评估幻觉检测器；比较仅NTP、NTP+语言NTP、以及融合VLM幻觉评分的性能，并与强VLM方法对比。

Result: 实验证明基于NTP的特征显著预测幻觉，轻量级ML模型在检测性能上可以逼近强VLM；加入语言-only NTPs进一步提高效果；将VLM的幻觉预测分数融入模型后，性能优于单一来源的方法。

Conclusion: NTPs是有效的幻觉检测信号，简单的机器学习模型基于NTPs即可实现接近强VLM的检测效果。结合语言-only NTPs与VLM输出的幻觉评分能进一步提升性能，提供一种计算效率高、延迟低的解决方案以增强VLM可靠性。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Use small genuine SPD samples to fit Riemannian GMM, sample synthetic SPD populations as positive/negative writers, train metric learning, test on real signature datasets achieving low error rates


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Writer-independent offline signature verification lacks sufficient labeled data and needs generalization to unseen writers; existing methods rely on real-world datasets

Method: Paper proposes quasi-synthetic data generation in SPD Riemannian space

Result: Riemannian Gaussian Mixture on SPD seeds generates synthetic writers; metric learning trained on synthetic pairs works well on real datasets

Conclusion: Generating synthetic SPD data via Riemannian Gaussian sampling provides effective training data for writer-independent signature verification, improving generalization across datasets

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

### [3] [Seedream 4.0: Toward Next-generation Multimodal Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20427)
*Team Seedream,Yunpeng Chen,Yu Gao,Lixue Gong,Meng Guo,Qiushan Guo,Zhiyao Guo,Xiaoxia Hou,Weilin Huang,Yixuan Huang,Xiaowen Jian,Huafeng Kuang,Zhichao Lai,Fanshi Li,Liang Li,Xiaochen Lian,Chao Liao,Liyang Liu,Wei Liu,Yanzuo Lu,Zhengxiong Luo,Tongtong Ou,Guang Shi,Yichun Shi,Shiqi Sun,Yu Tian,Zhi Tian,Peng Wang,Rui Wang,Xun Wang,Ye Wang,Guofeng Wu,Jie Wu,Wenxu Wu,Yonghui Wu,Xin Xia,Xuefeng Xiao,Shuang Xu,Xin Yan,Ceyuan Yang,Jianchao Yang,Zhonghua Zhai,Chenlin Zhang,Heng Zhang,Qi Zhang,Xinyu Zhang,Yuwei Zhang,Shijia Zhao,Wenliang Zhao,Wenjia Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0 is a unified multimodal image generation/editing system using an efficient diffusion transformer and compressed VAE, large-scale pretraining and multimodal post-training; employs multiple inference accelerations to produce high-res images fast and achieves SOTA on T2I and editing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unify T2I, image editing, multi-image composition; efficient high-res generation; strong generalization via large-scale pretraining and multimodal post-training

Method: Analyze architecture and techniques

Result: Efficient diffusion transformer with powerful VAE reducing tokens; pretraining on billions pairs; multimodal post-training with VLM; inference optimizations (distillation, distribution matching, quantization, speculative decoding); achieves SOTA and 1.8s for 2K image

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0 advances multimodal generation by combining token-efficient VAE, diffusion transformer, large-scale data, and inference optimizations to enable fast, high-quality, interactive high-res image synthesis and editing.

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过在大量未标注乳腺影像上进行ResNet-50的半监督对比学习并用少量标注数据微调，论文声称实现了在INbreast和MIAS上96.7%准确率，解决了标注数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受限于医学图像标注困难和标注数据稀缺，传统深度学习方法在乳腺癌检测上难以充分训练；对比学习能利用海量未标注数据提升特征表示，从而在小标注集上取得更好性能。

Method: 在大量未标注乳腺X线（mammogram）图像上，用各种数据增强和变换训练ResNet-50的对比学习表征；随后用小规模标注数据微调模型并使用相似性指标进行训练/评估。

Result: 作者报告在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上达到96.7%检测准确率，且据称超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于对比学习的半监督方法，用于乳腺肿瘤检测，宣称在有限标注数据下仍能取得优秀性能。

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

### [5] [Are Foundation Models Ready for Industrial Defect Recognition? A Reality Check on Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20479)
*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMs that excel on public image anomaly benchmarks fail on real industrial images; benchmarks don't reflect real-world manufacturing challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether the zero-shot generalization of foundation models can replace supervised models for automated quality inspection in series manufacturing and reduce labeling effort.

Method: Tested multiple recent foundation models on custom real-world industrial image datasets and on public image benchmark datasets, comparing zero-shot anomaly detection performance.

Result: The paper evaluates foundation models (FMs) for zero-shot anomaly detection in industrial manufacturing images and finds that while FMs perform well on public benchmarks, they fail on custom real-world industrial data. The study highlights the gap between benchmark performance and real-world applicability.

Conclusion: Current FMs are not reliable for zero-shot anomaly detection in real-world industrial manufacturing settings despite strong benchmark results, indicating a need for domain-specific adaptation or better evaluation datasets.

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 构建一个轻量CNN的编码器-解码器生成通用Neural Space，支撑多种成像与视觉任务共享特征，从而减少重复设计并提升跨域泛化与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决针对每个高精度视觉/成像任务定制模型导致的低效性，通过建立一个通用的特征空间（Neural Space）实现多任务共享，从而减少冗余并提升跨域泛化能力。

Method: 设计轻量级CNN编码器-解码器预计算并输出通用特征；训练时引入变换感知目标以增强表示的可迁移性；在相同NS上串接或并行训练多种下游模块（如去马赛克、去噪、深度估计、语义分割）以验证共享特征的有效性，并与大型Transformer骨干比较效率与泛化表现。

Result: 提出了一个基于编码器-解码器的Neural Space（NS）框架，利用轻量CNN骨干学习变换感知的通用表示，使去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割等下游模块能在同一特征空间中高效运行。

Conclusion: NS能有效整合多模任务，降低模型冗余，提升在域偏移下的泛化能力，并能在资源受限硬件上高效部署，为多任务视觉流水线提供可行基础。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

TL;DR: 在边缘相机场景下，采用高置信度流式选择加多样性采样，可用更少的数据查询成本训练出与更多标注数据近似的高质量小模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是边缘相机部署环境不断变化，需要经常更新模型，但带宽和计算资源有限。将复杂教师模型集中运行并选择性地将最有用的图像传输回服务器以标注，能在降低通信成本的同时提高训练效率。研究如何选择最有价值的图像以以最小的查询/传输代价获得最大化的模型质量。

Method: 方法包括：在中心有强教师模型标注图像，边缘设备上训练小型学生模型；提出并比较多种图像选择策略，重点是高置信度流式选择（只上传模型高置信度预测的样本）与多样性驱动的补充采样（保证数据集覆盖多样特征）；在相似训练负载下评估模型质量与查询成本。

Result: 结果表明：与其他采样策略相比，高置信度流式策略结合多样性方法，在保持相同性能（训练迭代）下显著减少了数据查询量，从而降低传输成本，同时训练出的学生模型质量较高。

Conclusion: 本文结论是：在边缘相机系统中，采用高置信度的流式选择策略结合基于多样性的采样，可在相同训练迭代量下，通过极少的数据查询（降低传输成本）训练出高质量的小模型。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON用VLM和分割模型自动生成基于文本的遮罩，把虚拟试衣当作图像条件修补，去掉手动画遮罩、支持复杂风格指令与多轮生成，可与现有模型结合达到最优效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化并提高虚拟试衣的可控性，使用户能通过自然语言对单件或多件服装进行细粒度、复杂的风格控制，消除对精确遮罩的需求，并处理遮罩方法难以实现的情形。

Method: 将虚拟试衣视为图像引导的修补任务；用VLM解析自由文本指令并与图像分割模型联合生成目标二值遮罩；在必要时自动执行多轮生成流程以实现无法单次遮罩得到的效果；与现有虚拟试衣模型接口互操作以完成最终合成。

Result: 提出InstructVTON：把虚拟试衣表述为基于图像的条件图像修补任务，结合视觉-语言模型与图像分割实现自动二值遮罩生成；可接受自由文本指令并自动执行多轮生成，能与现有虚拟试衣模型互操作并实现SOTA风格可控结果。

Conclusion: InstructVTON显著简化用户流程，扩展虚拟试衣的风格可控性与场景覆盖，解决了传统遮罩方法的局限，并能与现有方法互操作以提升结果质量。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

*Dana A Abdullah,Dana Rasul Hamad,Bishar Rasheed Ibrahim,Sirwan Abdulwahid Aula,Aso Khaleel Ameen,Sabat Salih Hamadamin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DeepAFRNet using VGG16 embeddings and cosine similarity to verify altered fingerprints; achieves strong per-difficulty accuracies on real altered dataset but is highly sensitive to similarity threshold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust recognition of deliberately altered fingerprint samples to ensure reliable biometric verification in high-security applications

Method: DeepAFRNet VGG16-based verification

Result: High accuracies on SOCOFing Real-Altered subset (96.7%, 98.76%, 99.54%) at strict threshold; severe performance drop with relaxed threshold (to 7.86%, 27.05%, 29.51%)

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet shows promising real-world readiness for AFR, but success depends critically on threshold selection and evaluation on real altered samples.

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Motivation: 自监督ViT捕获的类语义注意力能作为通用视觉先验，帮助机器人在缺乏大规模标注的情况下更好地聚焦关键物体与交互区域，从而改进双臂操控性能。

Method: 从预训练的DINOv2 ViT提取像素级注意力图，将其作为每像素显著性分数；通过相机参数把显著性投射并聚合到3D体素网格，得到体素级特征；将这些注意力特征与原始体素观测一并输入行为克隆的策略网络进行训练与测试。

Result: 在RLBench双臂任务上，加入注意力引导的体素特征令基线体素策略平均绝对提升8.2%，相对提升21.9%，表明方法在多任务操作场景中有明显效果。

Conclusion: 将DINOv2注意力图融入体素表示并用于体素为基础的策略，在RLBench双臂基准上平均绝对提升8.2%、相对提升21.9%，证明了无监督视觉先验对操作任务的实用性。

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

Motivation: 蓝莓在自然环境中检测受光照变化、遮挡与运动模糊影响，实际部署需要兼顾精度、速度和内存，现有研究缺乏大规模、多样化且公开的蓝莓检测数据集与系统性模型比较。

Method: 收集并标注661张智能手机拍摄的蓝莓树冠图像（2022–2023），总计85,879实例；在此数据集上训练与评估36个模型（YOLOv8–v12、RT-DETR v1–v2多种规模）；评估指标主要为mAP@50和推理时间；此外用2024年由地面机器视觉平台采集的1,035张未标注图像，通过Unbiased Mean Teacher半监督方法对所有模型进行微调以提升性能。

Result: 提出了一个用于蓝莓检测的新数据集并比较了36个实时目标检测器（YOLOv8-v12与RT-DETR v1-v2）；数据集包含661张带标注的树冠图像，共85,879个实例（成熟与未成熟）；最佳模型为RT-DETRv2-X（微调后mAP@50达94.8%），YOLOv12m表现也优异（mAP@50 93.3%）；中等规模模型在速度与精度间折中较好；使用Unbiased Mean Teacher半监督学习在1,035张跨域未标注图像上进行微调，提升范围为-1.4%至2.9%；数据集和代码公开。

Conclusion: 在自然条件下的蓝莓检测任务中，现代实时检测器能取得高精度（mAP@50≈93–95%）；RT-DETRv2-X为最佳单模型；半监督学习（Unbiased Mean Teacher）对跨域未标注数据有时能带来小幅提升但需进一步研究；中等规模模型通常是部署的较优选择。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文在有限数据条件下，通过训练时将整张乳腺X光图像以一定概率替换为从无标签边界框库随机裁切的ROI（可加扰动），提出轻量级ROI增强策略。在Mini-DDSM数据集上进行严格病人级交叉验证，报告ROC-AUC、PR-AUC及训练效率指标。最佳参数(p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10)下ROC-AUC有小幅提升，PR-AUC持平或略降，推理成本不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受限分辨率和小样本量限制了深度学习在乳腺X光解读中的性能，作者探索无需额外标注和复杂模型改动的轻量数据增强方法来提升分类效果。

Method: 构建一个无标签的边界框库，从中随机采样ROI并加入可选的扰动（jitter）。训练时以概率p_roi将整图替换为ROI裁剪，保留原图与ROI混合训练。评估采用病人级严格交叉验证，同时测量训练吞吐量和GPU显存占用。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM上，最佳ROI增强配置带来平均ROC-AUC小幅提升，但各折间表现不一致；PR-AUC无显著提升甚至略有下降；训练期效率可能受ROI策略影响，但推理成本保持不变。

Conclusion: 在数据受限的乳腺X光分类任务中，简单的训练期ROI增强能够在不增加标签或改动模型架构的前提下，带来有限的ROC-AUC提升且不增加推理开销，但效果在不同交叉验证折间存在波动。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用镜面反射把单张图像变成多视角输入，通过构建物理有效的虚拟相机与对称感知损失，实现通用且鲁棒的单帧/逐帧3D重建；并在合成与真实数据上验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 镜面反射在场景中常见，可同时在一张图中观测到真实与反射视角，提供额外立体信息。利用此特性可在单张图像下获得多视角信息，简化采集流程并兼容强大的前馈重建模型以提高泛化性与鲁棒性。

Result: 在自建的16个Blender合成场景（含点云与相机位姿真值）以及真实世界数据上，实验表明方法在几何恢复和位姿估计上效果显著，且能处理动态含镜面反射场景。

Conclusion: 该论文展示了利用镜面反射将单张图像扩展为多视角立体重建的方法，能在像素域生成物理有效的虚拟视角，并通过对称感知损失提高姿态估计，且可扩展到动态场景。整体在合成与真实数据上均有良好表现。

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: FacadeTrack links panoramic street video to parcels, rectifies facades, extracts interpretible attributes, and uses one-stage or two-stage decision strategies; two-stage yields better F1 and recall; provides auditable outputs for emergency workflows


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: determine building habitability post-disaster using street-view imagery linked to parcels; overcome limitations of overhead imagery

Method: analysis of methods

Result: two-stage approach: perception + conservative reasoning; one-stage rule baseline; reported metrics for both approaches; intermediate attributes for diagnostics

Conclusion: FacadeTrack offers scalable, interpretable occupancy assessment from street-level imagery with good precision/recall and diagnostic capabilities for quality control

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Humans label simple animated social interactions with diverse semantic terms; semantic (especially verb-based) embeddings from descriptions explain human similarity judgments beyond visual features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand which semantic representations humans use, beyond visual features, when perceiving social interactions from simple moving shapes.

Method: Study1: collected free-labels for animations; Study2: similarity judgments for 27 interactions compared to models (visual features, labels, semantic embeddings).

Result: Paper investigates semantic representations in human perception of simple moving-shape social interactions.

Conclusion: Social perception of minimal displays relies on semantic structure (verb-focused) that complements visual features, linking visual and abstract representations.

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

TL;DR: EGS通过E(2)-Steerable CNN提升旋转/视角鲁棒性，并用含超节点的图网络融合全局语义与局部细节，从而在两个主流基准上显著改进跨视角地理定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于克服现有CVGL方法在跨域泛化和在强烈外观变化（UAV不同方向与视角）下的稳健性不足，同时改善对全局场景语义与局部细粒度细节之间可靠对应的建模能力。

Method: 方法包括两部分：1) 使用E(2)-Steerable CNN作为编码器，以旋转和视角不变特征表征提高对UAV方向和视野变化的鲁棒性；2) 构建图结构并加入一个虚拟超节点（super-node），该节点与所有局部节点相连，用于聚合全局语义并将其分配到局部区域，从而强化全局与局部信息的对应关系。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准上进行的大量实验表明，EGS在跨域CVGL任务上持续带来显著性能提升，并在这些数据集上建立了新的最先进（SOTA）结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出了名为EGS的CVGL框架，通过引入E(2)-Steerable CNN编码器和含有超节点的图结构，有助于提高跨域鲁棒性与全局-局部一致性，从而显著提升地图匹配性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

TL;DR: 提出双路径边缘网络：一条路径用局部+全局自注意力（Transformer）进行语义建模，另一条路径用多尺度泰勒差分算子细化边缘，两者通过注意力门控融合，提高红外小目标在复杂背景下的检测与定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrared small targets lack distinctive textures/morphology and blend into cluttered/noisy backgrounds; need both high-res spatial details and robust semantic context, current methods insufficient (fixed gradients/simple attention).

Method: Dual-Path Edge Network with Bidirectional Interaction and Multi-Edge Refiner

Result: Proposed Dual-Path Edge Network decouples edge enhancement and semantic modeling; uses Bidirectional Interaction Module with Local and Global Self-Attention (Transformer) for multi-scale dependencies, and Multi-Edge Refiner with cascaded Taylor finite difference operators plus attention gating for precise edge localization and noise suppression; improves detection/localization of infrared small targets.

Conclusion: 将结构化语义与精细边缘增强解耦并融合，能更准确地检测与定位不同尺度的红外小目标，且对噪声抑制有效。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: Neptune-X有效结合高保真海事场景生成与任务相关样本选择，显著提高下游海事目标检测性能，并提供了用于研究的Maritime Generation Dataset和开源代码。

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

TL;DR: This work presents STELLA, the first full CBN system for year-long lunar mapping, and CRESENT-365, a benchmark dataset. STELLA achieves meter-level and sub-degree accuracy under realistic long-term, oblique, variable-illumination conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend crater-based navigation (CBN) from short-duration, nadir, well-lit landing scenarios to long-duration lunar mapping with sparse, oblique, varying-illumination imagery.

Method: Combination of Mask R-CNN crater detection, descriptor-less crater identification, perspective-n-crater pose solver, and batch orbit determination; evaluated on realistic synthetic dataset CRESENT-365 with SPICE-based illumination and motion.

Result: STELLA: end-to-end pipeline (Mask R-CNN crater detector, descriptor-less identification, robust pose solver, batch orbit determination) and CRESENT-365 dataset (15,283 rendered images simulating year-long mission). Achieves metre-level position and sub-degree attitude accuracy across diverse conditions.

Conclusion: CBN can work for long-duration lunar mapping when using a robust pipeline and batch orbit determination; results guide operational constraints for future missions.

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

*Zoe Wanying He,Sean Trott,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unimodal vision and language models converge on shared semantic representations in mid-to-late layers that align with human judgments; exemplar averaging strengthens this alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how and where deep vision-only and language-only models, trained on separate modalities, produce aligned representations and whether this alignment corresponds to semantic content and human judgments.

Method: Systematic layer-wise analysis of representation alignment, semantic perturbation experiments, forced-choice human vs model 'Pick-a-Pic' comparisons, and experiments averaging embeddings across exemplars.

Result: Alignment peaks in mid-to-late layers of both model types, is robust to appearance changes but sensitive to semantic changes, mirrors human preferences in image-caption matching tasks, holds bidirectionally for many-to-one mappings, and is amplified by averaging embeddings across exemplars.

Conclusion: Unimodal networks develop a shared semantic code aligning with human judgments; alignment emerges in mid-to-late layers, is semantic, bidirectionally captures many-to-many matches, and is amplified by exemplar aggregation.

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动或2D限制的方法在对象插入时难以实现精确的几何控制且常忽略插入对象与背景的风格一致性；此外希望避免大量训练，使方法对任意场景通用。

Method: 该方法先将2D目标对象转换为3D模型，进行基于3D的交互编辑（如形状、视角修改），然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像，作为几何控制信号；同时使用扩散适配器(diffusion adapters)来提供风格和内容控制，最终在扩散模型中融合渲染图与适配器信号生成编辑后图像。

Result: 通过结合3D重建/生成与扩散适配器，FreeInsert能实现带几何约束（形状与视角）且风格一致的对象插入，且无需对目标场景进行大量训练。实验表明在几何精度和视觉真实感方面优于若干基线方法。

Conclusion: FreeInsert提出了一个无训练(或少量训练)的3D引导图像插入框架，旨在解决现有基于扩散模型的图像编辑在几何控制和风格一致性方面的不足。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Conclusion: CustomEnhancer provides a practical, efficient enhancement to personalized diffusion models enabling precise, fast, and diverse identity-preserving generation without additional controller training

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

Abstract: With the increasing use of neural network (NN)-based computer vision
applications that process image and video data as input, interest has emerged
in video compression technology optimized for computer vision tasks. In fact,
given the variety of vision tasks, associated NN models and datasets, a

introduced as a comprehensive evaluation platform where new coding tools
compete to efficiently compress the input of vision network while retaining
task accuracy in the context of two different inference scenarios: "remote" and
"split" inferencing. Our study showcases various use cases of the evaluation
platform incorporated with standard codecs (under development) by examining the
compression gain on several datasets in terms of bit-rate versus task accuracy.
This evaluation platform has been developed as open-source software and is
adopted by the Moving Pictures Experts Group (MPEG) for the development the

Motivation: 在医疗图像分割中，域移位和标注成本高问题。现有半监督域泛化方法假设每个源域都有标注与未标注数据，但实际训练集中标注与未标注数据往往跨域分布不一致，亟需处理标注与未标注间的域差异。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

### [26] [Real-Time Object Detection Meets DINOv3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20787)
*Shihua Huang,Yongjie Hou,Longfei Liu,Xuanlong Yu,Xi Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEIMv2在DEIM基础上结合DINOv3特征与轻量化骨干，推出覆盖X到Atto八种规模的实时DETR训练框架，通过Spatial Tuning Adapter将单尺度语义增强的DINOv3输出转为多尺度细节特征，加上HGNetv2裁剪和简化解码器，在性能-成本上取得SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实时DETR训练框架虽已优于YOLO但在不同算力平台（GPU/edge/mobile）间缺乏统一且高效的规模适配；DINOv3带来强语义但为单尺度输出，缺少细粒度多尺度信息；需在保持精度的同时极致压缩参数以适配超轻量部署。

Method: 核心方法包括：1) 对X/L/M/S采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏骨干，并引入Spatial Tuning Adapter(STA)将单尺度DINOv3输出转为多尺度特征；2) 对Nano/Pico/Femto/Atto使用经深度和宽度裁剪的HGNetv2以满足严苛资源预算；3) 使用简化解码器与升级的Dense O2O训练框架；4) 统一设计以兼顾不同部署场景并优化性能-成本。

Result: 实验在COCO上表明：DEIMv2-X 50.3M参数达到57.8 AP，优于此前需>60M参数达到56.5 AP的模型；DEIMv2-S 9.71M参数达50.9 AP，为首个<10M突破50 AP的模型；DEIMv2-Pico 1.5M参数达38.5 AP，与YOLOv10-Nano(2.3M)性能相当但参数更少。

Conclusion: DEIMv2在各规模均实现了优异的性能-参数比：X型以50.3M参数达57.8 AP，S型以9.71M参数突破50 AP，Pico仅1.5M参数却达到38.5 AP，整体优于同类YOLO及先前X尺度模型。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

*Ved Umrajkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TL;DR: DAC-LoRA adds an adversarial curriculum to LoRA-style PEFT, using FOSC and TRADES-inspired loss to boost robustness of CLIP-based VLMs with little performance drop


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation: VLMs like CLIP used widely; PEFT methods efficient but still vulnerable to attacks; need lightweight robust adaptation to protect backbone

Method: Method: propose DAC-LoRA integrating adversarial training into PEFT with a dynamic curriculum guided by FOSC and TRADES loss

Result: Result: Substantial adversarial robustness improvements with minimal clean accuracy loss; integrates easily into PEFT pipeline; applicable to iterative attacks

Conclusion: Conclusion: DAC-LoRA is an effective, lightweight framework for improving adversarial robustness in PEFT of VLMs and can be broadly applied

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

*Jianhan Wu,Xiaoyang Qu,Zhangcheng Huang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FedDSPG：在联邦学习中通过生成器学习域特定软提示，训练阶段整合内容与域知识，推理阶段为未知域生成提示，提升跨域泛化性并在多数据集上达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt learning is efficient for adapting CLIP; federated learning faces domain shifts across clients and learned soft prompts lack diversity and ignore unknown domains. Need a generative approach to produce domain-specific prompts for unseen domains.

Method: Generative prompt-based federated domain generalization

Result: Proposed FedDSPG: introduce domain-specific soft prompts per domain, train a generator integrating content and domain knowledge across clients; at inference, generate DSPs for unseen targets to guide tasks. Achieves SOTA on public datasets, outperforms strong baselines.

Conclusion: FedDSPG通过生成多样化域特定软提示解决了联邦域泛化中提示多样性不足和未知域信息缺失的问题，在实验中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LumbarCLIP，一种基于CLIP的多模态框架，将腰椎MRI与放射学报告对齐以辅助诊断；在标注数据上通过ResNet-50/ViT/Swin与BERT编码器、线性/非线性投影头及soft CLIP损失训练，在线性投影下表现最佳，测试集分类最高达95.00%准确率和94.75% F1。

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

### [30] [Poisoning Prompt-Guided Sampling in Video Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20851)
*Yuxin Cao,Wei Song,Jingling Xue,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TL;DR：PoisonVID是第一个针对提示引导帧采样的黑盒投毒攻击，通过闭环优化生成通用扰动并利用影子模型与GPT-4o-mini构建多样化描绘集，在多模型多策略上实现82%–99%攻击成功率，暴露了VideoLLM采样机制的安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机：随着VideoLLM采样策略从均匀采样进化到语义相似度和提示引导策略，提示引导采样被认为更鲁棒但其安全性未受检验。作者指出潜在风险，即攻击者可通过对输入视频施加精心设计的扰动，使提示引导的采样机制忽略或降低对有害内容的敏感，从而规避检测和内容审核。

Method: 方法：PoisonVID通过闭环优化迭代地生成一个通用扰动，扰动作用于视频输入以抑制关键帧的相关性评分。核心包括：1）利用影子VideoLLM构建描绘集（depiction set），通过GPT-4o-mini对有害描述进行改写以增强多样性；2）在黑盒设定下通过查询反馈优化扰动，使其在多种提示引导的帧采样策略上都能降低相关性得分；3）通用扰动为视频级别可复用且与具体提示和模型解耦。

Result: 结果：在三个Prompt-guided采样策略和三款先进VideoLLM（具体模型未在摘要列出）上，PoisonVID取得82%–99%的攻击成功率，说明该攻击在多种设置下均有效。

Conclusion: 论文结论：提出了针对VideoLLMs的首个黑盒投毒攻击PoisonVID，能有效破坏基于提示的帧采样策略，使有害内容被忽略或未被选取，从而显著降低视频理解模型对有害语义的识别能力。实验表明在三种采样策略和三款先进VideoLLM上攻击成功率达到82%–99%。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

*Abdur Rehman,S M A Sharif,Md Abdur Rahaman,Mohamed Jismy Aashik Rasool,Seongwan Kim,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Game of Regularizer(G oR)，用2个可训练参数动态平衡TS与KD损失，改善收敛并提升低比特量化模型性能；扩展到EKD-GoR用于多教师蒸馏，甚至可超越全精度模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT-KD方法在低位量化下，任务损失与蒸馏损失梯度尺度不一致，导致训练难以收敛和性能下降，需一种简单有效的动态权重机制来平衡两类监督信号。

Method: 在训练损失中引入一个可学习的正则化器Game of Regularizer，包含两个标量参数，用于并列调节任务损失与蒸馏损失的权重；训练过程中根据梯度或损失动态更新这两个参数以减少冲突；并提出EKD-GoR通过多教师集成蒸馏进一步提升性能。

Result: GoR在QAT-KD场景下，用仅两个可训练参数自适应权衡任务损失与蒸馏损失，减少监督信号冲突，提升小量化模型表现，并能在低功耗设备实现更快推理。

Conclusion: GoR有效缓解TS与KD梯度量级不一致问题，通过简单可学习权重动态调节损失比例，实验涵盖分类、检测与LLM压缩，均优于现有QAT-KD方法；EKD-GoR在多教师条件下性能更佳，有潜力在实际部署中替代全精度模型。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展自动化植物识别系统到覆盖十万级别或大陆级植物组群，解决专家标注资源不足，通过利用网络海量图像资源探索规模与数据质量的权衡。

Method: 组织LifeCLEF 2017竞赛，构建三源数据：专家标注数据、网络抓取的噪声大数据、以及Pl@ntNet产生的测试集；邀请团队提交基于深度学习的图像分类系统，评估并比较不同训练数据策略的表现。

Result: The paper reports on the LifeCLEF 2017 plant identification challenge, comparing large noisy web-collected training data vs smaller expert-verified datasets, using Pl@ntNet app queries as test data, summarizing resources, participant methods, and outcomes.

Conclusion: 使用大量噪声但规模大的网络数据，在某些情况下能接近或超过小规模专家标注数据，结合多源数据与深度学习模型是可行路径，但数据清洗与标签噪声处理仍关键。

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

*Xiaonan Hu,Xuebing Li,Jinyu Xu,Abdulkadir Duran Adan,Letian Zhou,Xuhui Zhu,Yanan Li,Wei Guo,Shouyang Liu,Wenzhong Liu,Hao Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TasselNetV4，一种基于Vision Transformer并结合局部计数与提取-匹配范式的跨物种植物计数模型，通过多分支框感知局部计数器增强跨尺度鲁棒性，在两个新数据集上优于现有无类计数方法，效率高，可作为植物计数领域的基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于检测或回归的植物计数方法受物种多样性限制，难以构建所有物种的专属模型；植物具有动态、非刚性结构，使得现有面向刚性目标的无类计数和开放世界检测方法在植物计数上表现欠佳，因此需要面向跨物种、跨尺度的通用计数方法。

Method: 基于plain Vision Transformer，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想与类无关计数的extract-and-match范式，设计多分支框感知（box-aware）局部计数器以增强跨尺度鲁棒性；训练并评估于两个新收集的数据集（PAC-105与PAC-Somalia）。

Result: 在PAC-105与PAC-Somalia两个挑战性数据集上，TasselNetV4相较于当前最先进的类无关计数模型在计数精度和效率上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4在跨场景、跨尺度、跨物种的植物计数任务上表现优于现有CAC模型，兼顾精度与效率，具备成为植物计数视觉基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督OCT分割方法常产生解剖学不合理的结果，无法有效建模层与病变之间的关系，且缺乏拓扑正确性的保证；因此需要一种可强制拓扑约束并能在部分标注数据上泛化的模型。

Method: 设计了一个可微分的生物标志物拓扑引擎，结合风格-空间因子解耦的表示学习，支持在半监督设置下使用未标注和部分标注数据进行联合训练，实现层与病变的相互约束与生成。

Result: 在公开及内部OCT数据集上的实验显示，该方法在层和病变分割上均优于当前最先进方法，并能利用部分标注数据将层分割泛化到病理情况。

Conclusion: 该论文提出一种基于生物标志物拓扑引擎的半监督学习模型，能保证视网膜OCT图像中层与病变分割的解剖学合理性，并实现层间与病变间的双向影响学习，从而提升分割准确性和拓扑正确性。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve LLM reasoning in KB-VQA by reducing noisy caption info and providing context examples

Method: Prompting+Caption Rerank

Result: LLM-6.7B achieves 38.8% on OK-VQA and 34.6% on A-OKVQA

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA enhances LLM understanding and reasoning for KB-VQA via caption summarization and reranking, yielding strong results on OK-VQA/A-OKVQA.

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IQA指标与感知优化目标间存在显著不对称：优秀的评估器不等于好的损失函数；判别器在优化中重要但其表示不易迁移到IQA模型；判别器架构决定优化质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究感知优化目标（保真度目标与对抗目标）与图像质量评估（IQA）指标之间的对应关系及差异，尤其在对抗训练下的表现偏差。

Method: 系统性分析：比较多种保真度指标与对抗损失在优化中与评估中的表现差异；研究判别器表示的迁移能力；比较不同判别器架构（patch-level、卷积、vanilla、Transformer）对优化结果的影响。

Result: 发现一个意外的不对称性：在IQA上表现优秀的保真度指标并不一定适合用作感知优化的损失；在对抗训练中这种不匹配更明显；判别器能在优化中抑制伪影但其表示作为IQA模型初始化时效果有限；判别器的设计（patch-level及卷积结构）对细节重建更有利，优于原始或Transformer判别器。

Conclusion: 感知损失的选择不能仅基于其在IQA任务上的表现；对抗判别器设计需优先考虑patch-level和卷积结构以获得更忠实的细节重建；将判别器表示直接用于IQA初始化收益有限，需更有针对性的迁移策略。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

TL;DR: IOG-VQA结合对象交互自注意力与GAN去偏，旨在减少VQA数据偏差并更好建模对象关系，在VQA-CP数据集上取得优越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型容易依赖训练数据中的表面偏差，导致泛化能力差。为此提出同时从建模对象关系和数据去偏两方面改进模型。

Method: 提出IOG-VQA模型，包含Object Interaction Self-Attention用于建模图像中对象间的复杂相互作用，以及一个GAN-based debiasing框架用于生成更均衡的样本分布并训练去偏判别器。将视觉-文本特征融合后进行问答预测。

Result: 在VQA-CP v1与VQA-CP v2上进行大量实验，结果显示在处理偏置与数据不平衡方面优于现有方法，表明两部分设计对提升泛化能力有效。

Conclusion: IOG-VQA通过融合对象交互自注意力与基于GAN的去偏技术，旨在增强模型对视觉上下文的理解并减轻数据偏见，从而提升VQA性能。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

*Tristan S. W. Stevens,Oisín Nolan,Jean-Luc Robert,Ruud J. G. van Sloun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过将低秩时序先验与扩散生成模型后验采样相结合，替代稀疏误差假设，实现更真实的视频恢复；在心脏超声去雾任务上优于RPCA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统鲁棒PCA假设噪声为稀疏，但真实视频噪声和雾霾包含复杂、非稀疏结构，导致RPCA恢复受限；引入强表征能力的扩散生成模型可以更好捕捉残余复杂性。

Method: 先用核范数或时序低秩项建模背景/结构（低秩），再用扩散模型作为图像/帧级生成先验，通过后验采样补偿低秩分解未能解释的复杂残差，形成迭代恢复流程。

Result: 提出一种结合低秩时序建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架“Nuclear Diffusion”，用于视频去雾/消除结构噪声。方法在心脏超声去雾任务上优于传统鲁棒PCA，在对比度增强(gCNR)和信号保留(KS统计)上表现更好。

Conclusion: 融合基于模型的时序低秩先验与基于学习的扩散先验能更好地建模视频中复杂噪声与动态内容，从而提升恢复质量。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

TL;DR: 利用局部像素依赖重建图像暴露生成图像的纹理与边缘不连续，提出参数仅1.1M的FerretNet，在仅用ProGAN训练下于22种模型的开域基准上获97.1%平均准确率，超越现有方法约10.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对生成模型不断提高的逼真度，需要能泛化到多种模型的检测方法；作者认为生成过程引入的潜在分布偏差与解码器平滑效应会在局部像素依赖上留下可检测的伪证据。

Method: 基于马尔可夫随机场的LPD假设，利用邻域像素重建图像以暴露纹理与边缘破坏，随后输入到轻量神经网络FerretNet进行判别；模型训练仅使用ProGAN数据。

Result: This paper proposes FerretNet, a lightweight neural network for detecting synthetic images by exploiting local pixel dependencies (LPD) to reveal artifacts from latent distribution deviations and decoding-induced smoothing; trained on ProGAN only, it generalizes well across many generative models.

Conclusion: 通过基于LPD的重建来放大生成图像在局部纹理、边缘和色彩过渡上的不一致性，FerretNet在跨模型检测上表现优异且参数量小，证明了该方法的泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

TL;DR: 本文提出MoTIF，一种将概念瓶颈模型扩展到视频分类的Transformer风格架构，处理任意长度序列并从全局、局部和时间依赖三方面解释概念对动作的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，难以捕捉视频中的时间依赖性；需要一种能解释视频中动作/事件的概念化可解释方法，支持任意长度序列。

Method: 提出MoTIF架构：基于Transformer设计的模块对视频帧的概念进行编码，生成全局概念重要性、局部窗口内的概念相关性和概念随时间的依赖建模；概念定义为重复出现在时间上的语义实体或高层组件（如'bow','mount','shoot'）。

Result: 实验证明MoTIF能在视频分类任务上达到有竞争力的性能，同时提供更好的概念贡献解释，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 概念驱动的模型范式成功迁移到视频领域，MoTIF在保持竞争性能的同时提供了跨时间的概念可解释性，支持全局/局部/时间维度的概念分析。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可见光与热成像之间存在显著互补性，但标注数据通常稀缺，尤其是在多光谱条件下。因而需要设计能在少量标注下仍能有效利用跨模态信息的检测方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的FSMODNet通过跨模态特征融合在少样本多光谱目标检测任务上取得了较好效果，特别是在光照条件复杂和数据稀少的情形下表现稳健。

Abstract: Few-shot multispectral object detection (FSMOD) addresses the challenge of
detecting objects across visible and thermal modalities with minimal annotated
data. In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework
named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve
detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and
environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show
effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes,
outperforming several baselines we established from state-of-the-art models.

*Julius Pesonen,Arno Solin,Eija Honkavaara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Use particle filters with camera poses and image segmentation to localise distant objects (e.g., wildfire) without dense depth or reconstruction, effective in simulation and drone experiments


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dense depth estimation or full 3D reconstruction infeasible for distant objects or limited compute, so need lightweight localisation from camera poses + image segments

Method: particle filter for camera-based 3D localisation

Result: particle filter successfully localises single and multiple targets in 3D simulation and drone data using GNSS-camera poses and segmentation, works where other methods fail

Conclusion: Particle filtering is a flexible, detection-agnostic, computationally feasible solution for 3D localisation from camera-segment sequences and is suitable for drone-based wildfire monitoring when paired with segmentation models.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SwinMamba：在Swin风格多阶段网络中结合局部重叠偏移窗口的Mamba扫描与后续全局扫描，提升遥感影像语义分割的细节与上下文建模，实验证明优于SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba虽具全局感受野和低复杂度，但全局扫描易忽视局部关键特征（纹理、边缘），在遥感影像中会降低分割精度；因此需融合局部感知与全局建模能力。

Method: 在Swin Transformer架构启发下，前两阶段使用局部（重叠偏移窗口）Mamba式扫描以捕捉细粒度特征，后两阶段转为全局Mamba式扫描以融合广域上下文；通过重叠的偏移窗口增强区域间信息交换。

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的大量实验表明，SwinMamba在语义分割指标上超过现有最先进方法，证明其在遥感影像分割中的有效性。

Conclusion: SwinMamba结合局部与全局Mamba式扫描，在遥感影像语义分割中能更好地捕获细节与上下文，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PackMIL：把可变长切片特征打包为定长、残差分支回收被丢弃特征形成超切片、注意力下采样减少冗余，提升准确率并大幅节省训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI序列极长且长度变化大，有限监督下容易导致数据异质性与冗余，传统方法在效率与优化上折中。为兼顾保留异质性与训练效率，提出打包与残差回收机制并结合注意力下采样。

Method: 1) Pack机制：将来自多个WSI的可变长特征序列采样并拼包为定长输入，实现batched训练；2) 残差分支：收集采样时丢弃的特征，组合成超切片并配以定制标签进行监督，提供多切片信息并补偿采样损失；3) 注意力下采样器：在两条分支上对特征进行注意力驱动的压缩以减少冗余；4) 训练策略与损失设计以兼顾样本异质性与效率。

Result: 提出了一种用于病理全切片图像的pack-based MIL框架，通过将多个可变长特征序列打包为定长序列实现批量训练，并引入残差分支将丢弃特征组合成超切片进行多切片监督；同时使用注意力驱动的下采样器压缩冗余特征。实验证明在PANDA(UNI)上可在仅用12%训练时间的情况下提高最多8%的准确率。

Conclusion: 聚焦序列长度异质性与冗余问题，通过打包与残差超切片及注意力下采样，PackMIL在保持数据多样性的同时显著提升性能与训练效率，适合CPath大规模和基础模型场景。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

Motivation: 解决现有基于模拟器的运动投影层在扩散生成过程中计算昂贵且无法并行化的问题

Method: 将模拟器投影视为扩散指导（分类器或无分类器形式），并将环境参数作为条件输入到去噪网络，从而在训练和推理阶段直接生成符合物理约束的动作

Result: 提出SimDiff：将环境参数（重力、风等）直接条件化到去噪过程中，从而无需在推理时反复调用模拟器即可高效生成物理合理的人体运动，并支持对物理系数的细粒度控制和对未见参数组合的泛化

Conclusion: SimDiff通过在扩散去噪过程中融入环境参数，实现了无需重复模拟器调用的高效物理约束生成，并展现出对未见环境参数组合的泛化能力

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Method: Empirical + theoretical analysis

Result: 通过对1174个预训练模型的大规模评估，识别出四个一致的设计模式（更大stem核、更小输入分辨率、平均池化、监督ViT优于CLIP ViT），这些改变可带来显著的鲁棒性和精度提升；并提供理论证明支持经验观察

Conclusion: 将鲁棒性分解为可解释模块，理论解释观察到的趋势，并提供即插即用的指南以提高模型对高斯噪声的鲁棒性。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and
training.

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality
control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device
implementation.

advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: 提出无需预训练的ASD适配器，通过随机伪标签、实例级分类与类迁移追踪生成簇级伪标签，从而使SSL学习器实现冷启动图像聚类，效果接近使用真标签的SSL方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有将自监督学习(SSL)应用于深度图像聚类时的先验需求问题，使SSL模型能够无需预训练或已有聚类模型即插即用地进行聚类。

Method: 1) 随机从无标签数据中采样并赋予伪标签；2) 训练实例级分类器以学习语义对齐的实例标签；3) 跟踪未标注数据上预测的类转移以提取实例类间的高级相似性；4) 基于此相似性为伪样本分配簇级标签；5) 使用得到的簇级伪标签触发通用SSL学习器在无标签数据上训练以完成图像聚类。

Result: 提出ASD适配器，采用随机伪标签与实例级分类器，追踪预测类别转移以构建类间相似性并分配簇级标签，最终驱动通用SSL学习器实现冷启动深度图像聚类；在多个基准上性能优于最新方法，与使用真实标签的SSL方法差距极小（CIFAR-10上仅1.33%）。

Conclusion: ASD实现了SSL模型在图像聚类任务中的无先验冷启动，显著提升了聚类性能并具备与有真标签SSL方法接近的效果，同时能增强已有SSL嵌入的聚类方法。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

TL;DR: 提出SiNGER方法，通过奇异值空间引导的扰动在教师特征中抑制高范数伪影同时保留信息，再蒸馏到学生，使用LoRA适配器高效实现，在多任务上提高学生性能并改善表征可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT存在高范数伪影，会在蒸馏过程中主导目标，导致学生过拟合伪影、忽视真实信息，从而削弱更大模型的益处；需要一种方法在抑制伪影的同时保留教师的有用信号。

Conclusion: SiNGER能在不牺牲有信息信号的前提下有效抑制高范数伪影，显著提升学生模型在下游任务的表现和表征清晰度，达到了多项任务的最先进结果。

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

*Qinqin He,Jiaqi Weng,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNCE uses a Sparse Autoencoder to disentangle text embeddings so single neurons correspond to atomic concepts; it identifies harmful neurons via modulated frequency scoring and suppresses them to erase concepts while preserving image quality and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing concept erasure methods struggle to precisely remove harmful concepts without degrading image quality; leveraging single-neuron control could allow surgical, minimal-impact erasure.

Method: Train a Sparse Autoencoder to produce sparse, disentangled latent space mapping text embeddings to neurons aligned with semantic concepts. Identify harmful concept neurons using modulated frequency scoring on activation patterns. Suppress the target neuron to erase the concept during generation.

Result: The paper introduces SNCE, a method for erasing harmful concepts in text-to-image models by manipulating a single neuron identified via a Sparse Autoencoder and a modulated frequency scoring of activations. It claims precise erasure with minimal quality loss and robustness to adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: SNCE can surgically remove harmful concepts by suppressing a single identified neuron, achieving state-of-the-art erasure with minimal impact on other generation abilities and superior adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出KD-SS——一种与传感器无关的KD树子采样方法，保留全分辨率点云，替代下采样与繁重预处理，能与现有分割模型联合用于多种植物与传感器模态的器官分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常针对特定植物或传感器，并且依赖大量预处理和下采样，导致分辨率丢失；需要一种与传感器无关且能保留全分辨率的轻量化子采样方案。

Method: 基于KD树的子采样(KD-SS)，在不下采样整体输入的情况下选择代表性点以保留局部结构细节，兼容不同传感器模式的数据。

Result: 将KD-SS与现有最先进分割模型结合，在多种模态（光度測量/摄影测量、激光三角测量、LiDAR）和不同植物种类上表现良好，证明其在不丢失分辨率的前提下提升了分割适用性与效率。

Conclusion: KD-SS是一种简单有效的生物点云子采样方法，保持分辨率，适用于多种传感器和植物种类，可与现有分割模型结合以处理全分辨率点云。

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FS-OOD前景-背景分解方法过度依赖局部类别相似性且使用固定的背景补丁提取策略，导致鲁棒性差。

Method: 1) 学习背景prompt以获得初始局部背景相似性；2) 用局部类别相似性对其精炼，得到更鲁棒的背景相似性；3) 同时利用精炼后的背景相似性与局部类别相似性进行背景补丁提取；4) 引入patch自校准调优，根据样本多样性动态选择背景补丁数量；5) 在真实数据集上进行广泛对比实验验证效果。

Conclusion: Mambo能减少对局部类别相似性的依赖，解决固定背景提取策略问题，并在多项现实数据集上取得SOTA的OOD和near-OOD检测效果。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at
https://github.com/YuzunoKawori/Mambo.

TL;DR: 为语义分割数据集划分提出两种分层方法，重点是用遗传算法最小化Wasserstein距离的WDES，理论保证全局最优并在多领域任务中提高划分代表性和评估稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机划分在分割任务中常产生不具代表性的测试集，导致评估偏差和泛化差，因而需要针对多标签和不平衡性质设计分层划分方法。

Method: IPS通过逐像素考虑标签分布进行分层采样；WDES构建遗传算法，个体表示划分，适应度基于各分割集之间标签分布的Wasserstein距离，使用选择、交叉、变异操作并证明在无限代数下能达到全局最优。

Result: 提出两种分割数据集的方法：迭代像素分层（IPS）和基于Wasserstein距离的进化分层（WDES）；WDES在足够代数下理论上全局最优；引入新的统计异质性指标评估分割数据划分；在多种任务上实验证明WDES生成更具代表性的划分，降低性能方差并改善评估，尤其在小型、类别不平衡和低多样性数据集上效果显著。

Conclusion: WDES能显著提高数据划分的代表性，减少模型评估偏差；IPS作为简单高效的基线也有帮助；在小样本和不平衡场景下优势明显。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

TL;DR: 通过将taxonomy作为监督信号融入端到端网络，EnGraf-Net在细粒度分类上提升了性能，避免了裁剪和人工标注依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于部件或自动注意力的细粒度分类方法常因局部特征表达不完整而受限；人类识别不仅依赖叶节点信息，还会利用语义层次结构进行联想，因此引入层次化语义信息可提供额外的判别线索。

Method: 在端到端的深度网络中引入层次化语义关联（taxonomy）作为监督信号，替代或补充部件级裁剪/注意力策略，训练时不需要额外的部件注释或裁剪操作。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft数据集上进行大量实验，EnGraf-Net优于多数现有细粒度模型，并在不需裁剪或人工标注的情况下与最新最优方法性能相当或更好。

Conclusion: 利用层次化语义关联作为监督信号能有效增强细粒度分类模型的判别能力。EnGraf-Net在不依赖裁剪或人工标注的前提下，在多个基准数据集上取得了优于多数已有方法且接近最新最优方法的结果。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

Motivation: 随着机器学习在安全关键领域的广泛应用，评估并理解ViT在现实世界样式对抗攻击（如衣物折痕导致的补丁）下的脆弱性十分重要，以改进防御策略并揭示预训练因素如何影响鲁棒性。

Method: 使用Creases Transformation生成现实感几何畸变的对抗补丁，并在四个微调的ViT二分类（人/非人）模型上测试攻击成功率，以评估CNN到ViT的迁移性和模型间鲁棒性差异。

Result: 四个ViT模型的攻击成功率分别为：google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k 40.04%，google/vit-base-patch16-224 66.40%，facebook/dino-vitb16 99.97%，facebook/dinov3-vitb16 65.17%；表明对抗补丁在不同ViT上的效果差异大，且预训练方法与数据规模显著影响鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 对抗补丁可从CNN迁移至ViT并有效导致误分类；模型的预训练数据规模与方法对鲁棒性影响显著，部分ViT（如facebook/dino-vitb16）极易被攻击。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: achieve precise and controllable video concept transfer by decomposing spatial components and diffusion timesteps

Method: analysis of UniTransfer architecture and methods

Result: proposed UniTransfer with spatial decomposition (foreground, background, motion), dual-to-single-stream DiT, self-supervised random masking pretraining, Chain-of-Prompt timestep decomposition guided by LLMs; created OpenAnimal dataset; outperforms baselines

Conclusion: UniTransfer provides a novel decomposed diffusion-based architecture and progressive generation strategy enabling fine-grained, controllable video concept transfer, supported by new dataset and strong empirical results.

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

Conclusion: VTTS’s iterative perception and scaling of perceptual compute at test time substantially improve MLLM reasoning and generalization across video conversation, reasoning, and spatio-temporal perception tasks.

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

TL;DR: 提出DTW驱动的过程奖励用于视频推理的强化学习微调，使模型推理过程更一致且提高视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析并解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中的过程不一致性问题，提升模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用规则化的DTW过程奖励在强化学习框架中进行微调，并通过动态状态预测任务和MOSS-Video基准进行训练与评估，避免了额外奖励模型。

Result: 提出MOSS-ChatV，一个基于强化学习且使用动态时间规整(DTW)的过程奖励框架；构建MOSS-Video基准；在多个模型和基准上取得性能提升并获得更一致的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: MOSS-ChatV通过DTW过程奖励有效对齐推理过程与时间标注参考，提高了视频推理的一致性和泛化能力，适用于不同模型架构并在多个基准上表现优异。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

Motivation: 现有方法分开学习相机与物体运动导致相对运动混淆，难以在存在相机与物体同时运动时保持一致性与泛化能力。

Method: 将相机与物体运动转换为像素级运动；利用稳定扩散网络学习与给定相机轨迹对应的参考运动图；提取语义物体先验；将运动图与先验输入图像到图像到视频网络生成视频。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，所提模型在定量与定性指标上大幅优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 方法能在指定相机轨迹下生成保持物体运动一致性的视频，实验显示优于现有方法。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究生成模型与判别器的对抗中，数据的维度和复杂度如何影响判别器识别合成图像的能力。结论是：维度增加通常有利于判别器，但数据复杂度呈非单调效应——极低或极高的复杂度都不利于判别，介于两者之间的中等复杂度最有利于检测合成图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成AI进步，合成与真实图像难以区分，本研究旨在找出判别器最脆弱的条件以指导检测方法和生成对抗训练策略。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂性作为数据内在结构的量化指标，理论分析生成器对不同复杂度分布的拟合能力以及判别器检测错误的可见性；结合维度作用推导出复杂度-可检测性之间的非单调关系。

Result: 理论证明并阐明了数据维度与复杂度对检测能力的相互作用：高维利于检测，中等复杂度最有利；极端复杂度（过于简单或极其多样）会削弱判别器效果。

Conclusion: 判别器在中等复杂度的数据上最具优势；维度增大会增强判别器，但当数据极其简单或极其复杂时，判别器识别合成图像的能力都会下降。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出WAVECLIP，一种基于小波分解的统一模型，使CLIP在单个模型中支持多分辨率自适应推理。模型从低分辨率开始，按需细化，通过键值缓存与跨层因果注意力复用计算，引入新信息仅在必要时进行。使用冻结CLIP教师的轻量蒸馏与基于置信度的门控实现零样本分类中的自适应提前退出，在保证准确性的同时显著降低计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少视觉-语言模型（如CLIP）在多分辨率场景中的重复计算与部署成本，使单一模型能适配不同计算资源与精度需求，同时保持零样本分类能力。

Method: 将图像的标准patch embedding替换为多层小波分解生成的token；在推理阶段自低分辨率开始，按需细化到更高分辨率；采用键值缓存和因果跨层注意力复用先前计算；通过从冻结的CLIP教师进行轻量蒸馏训练；使用置信度门控在零样本分类中实现提前退出。

Result: 在零样本分类任务上，WAVECLIP经轻量蒸馏可与教师模型保持竞争性准确率，同时通过置信度门控实现自适应提前退出，显著降低平均推理计算量。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP能在不牺牲精度的前提下，通过多层小波分解和跨层因果注意力实现按需细化与计算重用，结合轻量蒸馏和置信度门控实现单模型内的动态计算-精度权衡，实验显示在零样本分类中能显著节省计算并保持竞争性准确性。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 量化不仅能提高效率，还会复杂地影响CLIP的可靠性：依赖预训练来源，量化可改善或恶化校准，但不妨碍OOD检测提升；合适的QAT能实现多目标共赢。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究主要关注CLIP的准确率，而忽略了部署时关键的效率与可靠性权衡，特別是量化这个常用的效率手段对校准与鲁棒性的影响未被充分研究。

Method: 本文通过大规模实验评估不同量化方案（含后训练量化和量化感知训练QAT）对多种CLIP模型的影响，衡量指标包括零-shot准确率、置信度校准、OOD检测性能及其他可靠性度量，比较不同预训练数据源的模型响应。

Result: 量化通常改善了那些原本欠自信的预训练模型的校准；对过度自信模型则可能恶化校准，但这些模型在OOD检测上仍能获得提升。特定的QAT方法可同时提升零-shot准确率、校准和OOD鲁棒性，打破效率与性能的严格权衡。

Conclusion: 量化对CLIP模型的影响并非单一方向，而是依赖于预训练来源和具体量化方法，既能改善置信度校准，也可能在某些情况下使校准变差，但同时不影响甚至提升其他可靠性指标如OOD检测。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Motivation: 现有VTU基准依赖合成渲染、缺乏真实表格的复杂性与视觉多样性，且示例不可重构，阻碍模型泛化与可扩展评估。

Method: 构建包含4M示例、2M唯一表格的VTU数据集，每例包含图像与HTML表示、元数据和溯源信息，88%保留原始视觉化；用于微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B等VL模型进行增广训练与评估。

Result: 在TABLET上微调提升了模型在已见与未见VTU任务上的性能，并增强了对真实表格可视化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TABLET通过保留原始可视化、提供图像-HTML配对与可追溯元数据，为视觉表格理解提供了更真实、多样且可扩展的大规模训练与评估基线。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

Motivation: 提升基于图像的特征归因解释的可靠性与可控性，使解释能忠实反映黑盒模型的推理并允许用户控制解释的保真度。

Method: 基于conformal prediction构建框架，定义四种一致性函数来评估解释是否足以维持模型预测；对解释器输出进行阈值选择以得到显著特征子集；无需真实解释标签进行校准；通过与多种解释方法和数据集比较评估保真度与解释区域大小。

Result: 提出一种基于顺序预测（conformal prediction）的方法，能在无需真实解释标签校准下识别保证保持模型预测的显著特征子集；设计了四种一致性函数；在六个图像数据集、五个解释器上评估，FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率上表现最佳；超像素基础的一致性度量优于像素级度量。

Conclusion: 该方法允许直接控制解释的保真度并在多数据集、多解释器评估中证明了有效性；超像素级一致性度量更为有效，FastSHAP为首选。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

Motivation: 解决骨架数据在手语理解（SLU）中的语义对齐与细粒度/全局信息平衡问题，以提高跨模态学习效率和预训练语义一致性。

Method: 采用sign-aware早期融合将文本语义注入视觉骨架特征；在不同表示层进行分层对齐损失；统一预训练目标混合对比学习、文本匹配与语言建模。

Result: 提出Sigma框架，包括：1) sign-aware早期融合机制实现视觉与文本深度交互；2) 分层对齐学习策略在不同层次最大化跨模态特征一致性；3) 结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模的统一预训练。Sigma在多种基准上实现了ISLR、CSLR和无词汇表SLT的新SOTA。

Conclusion: 语义信息丰富的预训练与骨架作为独立输入能显著提升手语理解任务表现；Sigma证明了早期跨模态交互与分层对齐的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

Motivation: 当前文本-图像生成评估过度依赖未经充分验证的自动指标，而评估结果直接影响研究进展和模型选择，故需检验这些指标与人类偏好的一致性并揭示其局限。

Method: 对多种常用评估指标（包括VQA-based、embedding-based和image-only等）在多组组合性问题上进行大规模比较；不仅计算相关性，还分析指标在不同语义挑战（对象、属性、关系等）中的表现差异，并与人工判断对齐度进行对照。

Result: Comprehensive empirical evaluation of text-image alignment metrics

Conclusion: 研究表明需要根据具体组合性问题谨慎选择评估指标，并在使用这些指标作为奖励模型时保持透明；未来工作应针对不同任务开发或组合指标以更好匹配人类偏好。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是WSI中既存在远程的全局上下文信息也有局部的空间关系，单一模型难以同时兼顾两者，因此设计融合Mamba（长程）与GNN（短程）以获得更全面的表征。

Method: 方法包含两个并行分支：Mamba模块用于捕捉长程全局依赖，GNN用于建模短程细粒度空间交互；两分支输出通过基于预测熵的置信加权自适应融合策略进行动态组合；在基因融合/突变预测任务上与多种基线模型比较评估。

Result: SlideMamba在基因融合/突变预测任务上表现优越，PRAUC为0.751±0.05，显著优于MIL、Trans-MIL、单独Mamba、单独GNN及GAT-Mamba；同时在ROC AUC、灵敏度、特异性上也具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种将Mamba架构与图神经网络（GNN）结合的通用化深度学习框架SlideMamba，用于从全切片图像（WSI）中提取局部与全局的互补表征并进行预测任务，结论是融合结构和基于熵的自适应加权能提高基因融合和突变状态预测性能。

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain need for fine-grained cross-modal controls in 3D generation

Method: Summarize method and architecture

Result: improved accuracy and robustness

Conclusion: Adds controllability and robustness to 3D asset generation

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用视觉-语言模型（VLM）和自然语言提示自动生成语义注意力图，并通过辅助损失将CNN注意力与之对齐，以替代人工注释从而减少模型利用“捷径”。在ColoredMNIST和DecoyMNIST上表现良好，在ColorMNIST上达SOTA，并在DecoyMNIST上与需要大量注释的方法竞争，显示出更好的泛化和更符合人类直觉的注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN容易利用表面相关性（捷径）导致不可靠预测。认知科学表明人类依靠注意力进行稳健感知，因此引导模型注意力到语义相关区域可以提高模型可靠性。但现有方法依赖昂贵的人工概念注释，故提出自动化、可扩展的方法。

Method: 使用预训练视觉-语言模型与手工或自动的自然语言提示生成每张输入图像的语义注意力图（heatmap）。在训练CNN时加入一个额外的损失项，最小化模型内部注意力（例如Grad-CAM或其他可微注意力映射）与VLM生成的语言引导注意力图之间的差异，从而鼓励模型关注语义相关区域。

Result: 在ColoredMNIST和DecoyMNIST上实验：在ColoredMNIST上取得SOTA性能；在DecoyMNIST上与依赖人工注释的方法保持竞争力。整体表现为更好的一般化，降低对捷径的依赖，且模型注意力更符合人类直觉。

Conclusion: 利用VLM生成的语言引导注意力图并通过辅助对齐损失来指导CNN注意力，可减少对人工注释的依赖，提高模型对抗捷径的鲁棒性和可解释性，在合成数据集上验证了有效性。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在自然语言和二维视觉上已成功，但在MRI领域受限于数据稀缺、解剖覆盖窄、序列异质性大，导致自动化分析难以规模化和泛化；因此需要一个专门针对三维MRI、覆盖广泛临床变异的通用表示学习框架。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一个面向三维MRI的视觉-语言基础模型Decipher-MR，旨在通过大规模、多样化的MRI数据和报告引导的文本监督，构建可迁移、可扩展的表示；冻结编码器并仅调优轻量任务解码器，提高下游任务的效率和通用性。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for
MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research
domains.

TL;DR: Proposes SQ-InstructBLIP that iteratively generates image-aware sub-questions and answers via Questioner/Answerer and a Reasoner to improve VQA multi-step reasoning without relying on black-box LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of LLM-based multi-step reasoning in V+L tasks: LLMs can't access fine-grained image content and are black-boxes hard to reproduce.

Method: SQ-InstructBLIP

Result: A modular model (Questioner, Answerer, Reasoner) with shared architecture generates image-aware sub-questions/answers iteratively and uses them to improve VQA reasoning, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Using generated image-aware sub-questions as auxiliary information improves VQA reasoning accuracy compared to prior approaches.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

*Seyed Amir Kasaei,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Defines T2I hallucination as bias-driven deviations from prompts and taxonomy into attribute, relation, object hallucinations to improve evaluation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing T2I evaluations focus on alignment to prompts and miss content generated beyond prompts; need to surface bias-driven deviations

Method: analysis of T2I hallucination framing

Result: Proposes taxonomy of hallucination: attribute, relation, object; introduces evaluation upper bound and reveals hidden biases

Conclusion: Framing provides foundation for richer assessment and highlights limits of alignment-only evaluation

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对微动作识别的“个体无关”框架，结合分布式稳健优化，通过特征层（时域-频域对齐模块）和损失层（群不变正则化损失）两个可插拔组件，消除个体差异，提高泛化与鲁棒性。在MA-52数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微动作识别在真实场景中受个体差异影响严重，同一动作在不同人表现不同，导致模型难以泛化。为实现对未见个体的稳健识别，需要学习个体无关的表示并强化对难例的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module：双分支（时域分支采用Wasserstein正则化对齐，频域分支采用方差引导扰动），并通过一致性驱动融合；以及Group-Invariant Regularized Loss：构建伪群体，上调边界样本权重并正则化子群方差。两者均为可插拔模块嵌入现有模型中。

Result: 在大型MA-52数据集上，框架在准确率和鲁棒性上均优于现有方法，能在细粒度条件下保持稳定泛化表现。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效抑制个体间差异对微动作识别的影响，通过时域与频域的联合对齐和基于伪分组的损失正则化，提升了模型对难例与未见个体的泛化能力，实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 迁移VGGT到语义匹配：保留早期特征、微调后期并加语义头；用循环一致性、合成增强与渐进训练克服数据稀缺与对称性问题，显著提升几何感知和匹配质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法依赖2D基础模型特征导致几何歧义（对称结构难以区分）且使用逐像素最近邻匹配忽视跨图不可见性与流形保持，因而需要几何感知的像素描述子和整体密集匹配机制。VGGT作为3D几何基础模型具备几何指向的特征与整体匹配能力，适合填补这些缺陷。

Method: 方法包括：重用VGGT早期阶段特征、微调后期阶段并增加双向语义对应头；采用循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强（synthetic augmentation）、渐进式训练和别名伪影缓解等技术使模型适应跨实例语义匹配；训练时强调双向匹配和流形保持，避免单向最近邻规则的缺陷。

Result: 在大量实验中，所提方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面均优于先前基线，显示出更好的对称性歧义处理与跨实例语义对应能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种将3D几何基础模型VGGT迁移到语义匹配任务的方法，通过保留早期特征、微调后期层并添加语义头，以及引入循环一致性训练、合成数据增强和渐进训练来克服数据稀缺与对称性歧义问题，最终在几何感知和流形保持方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

TL;DR: 提出MedVSR：利用CSSP改善对齐、ISSR减少伪影并增强组织结构，针对医疗视频超分辨率效果更好且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对临床低分辨率医疗视频存在的摄像抖动、噪声、突变帧和组织结构细腻但易被伪影干扰的挑战，提出专门的VSR框架以提升诊断用视频的分辨率与可靠性。

Method: 核心方法包括CSSP（将远帧投影为状态空间控制矩阵，选择性传播稳定信息以辅助对齐）和ISSR（结合长程空间特征学习与大核短程聚合以增强组织细节、抑制伪影）。

Result: MedVSR针对医疗视频超分辨率中的对齐困难与伪影问题提出了专门设计的框架，通过跨状态空间传播（CSSP）与内部状态空间重建（ISSR）模块实现对远距离帧信息的选择性传播与组织结构增强。实验显示MedVSR在多种医疗场景数据集上在重建效果与效率上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MedVSR有效缓解医疗视频中由于抖动、噪声和帧突变导致的对齐误差，并通过大核与长程空间学习提升组织结构重建，实验验证了其在多数据集上的优越性。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 海洋科学中标注数据稀缺且昂贵，基础模型通过在大量无标签遥感数据上自监督预训练，有望提高下游任务在小样本条件下的性能并捕捉复杂空间特征，从而推动海洋监测与气候相关研究。

Method: 基于Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构，在大量Sentinel-3 OLCI无标签影像上进行自监督重建预训练，随后在两个下游任务上进行有标签微调：叶绿素浓度估算（与现有基线模型比较）和遥感初级生产力估计的细化，评估空间细节恢复和与点位观测的一致性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像合成任务中将指定对象无缝插入新场景，但现有方法在复杂光照与高分辨率下表现欠佳。扩散模型含有物理与分辨率先验，却缺乏不通过潜变量反演或脆弱的注意力手术即可利用这些先验的框架。

Method: 核心方法包括：1) manifold-steered anchor loss，借助IP-Adapter等预训练适配器在潜变量空间引导以保持主体特征；2) degradation-suppression guidance抑制低质退化；3) adaptive background blending进行自适应背景融合；整体无需额外训练。

Result: 提出SHINE，无需训练，利用manifold-steered anchor loss和预训练定制适配器引导潜变量以忠实表示主体并保留背景，同时提出degradation-suppression guidance与adaptive background blending来消除低质输出与可见接缝。在ComplexCompo与DreamEditBench上取得SOTA，在DINOv2、DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward等指标上均优。

Conclusion: SHINE在复杂光照和高分辨率条件下实现了更自然的对象插入，减少了反演与注意力手术带来的问题，同时提供新的挑战性基准ComplexCompo。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: QuantVGGT is a PTQ framework for billion-scale VGGTs combining Hadamard rotation + channel smoothing and outlier-filtered diverse calibration sampling to robustly quantize models, enabling practical 4-bit deployment with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGTs achieve strong 3D reconstruction but are too large for deployment; PTQ faces challenges due to special tokens causing heavy-tailed activations and unstable calibration sampling for multi-view 3D data.

Method: Post-Training Quantization for Visual Geometry Grounded Transformers (VGGTs)

Result: Proposed QuantVGGT with Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained Quantization and Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling; achieves state-of-the-art quantization across benchmarks and bit-widths, with 4-bit model giving 3.7x memory reduction, 2.5x speedup, and >98% reconstruction accuracy compared to full precision.

Conclusion: QuantVGGT effectively addresses heavy-tailed activations and unstable calibration in VGGTs, enabling aggressive PTQ (down to 4-bit) with significant resource savings and minor accuracy degradation; code is released.

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模文本到视频生成在运动物理一致性和可控性方面存在瓶颈，现有模型仅从外观学习运动分布，缺乏对底层动力学的理解，导致不现实的运动轨迹和难以调节的参数化控制。

Method: 核心方法是神经牛顿动力学（NND），它作为可训练模块学习牛顿力学下的运动规律并在潜在空间内预测位移/速度等动力学变量，生成器在采样时同时受数据驱动的外观先验和NND提供的动力学约束的影响。

Result: NewtonGen提出了一种将可学习的物理原理与数据驱动合成相结合的文本到视频生成框架，通过引入可训练的“神经牛顿动力学”（NND）模块，在潜在空间中建模和预测牛顿运动，从而为视频生成注入动力学约束。实验表明该方法能生成更符合物理规律的运动（例如避免物体向上掉落、速度和方向突变等问题），并支持在不同初始条件下对运动参数进行精确控制。

Conclusion: 通过在生成模型中引入NND，NewtonGen能显著改善视频中运动的物理一致性并提供精确参数控制，缓解现有模型单纯依赖外观导致的不合理运动问题。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
