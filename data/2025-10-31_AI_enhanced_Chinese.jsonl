However, these systems fall short in real-world interactive\nscenarios, where user intents evolve and queries must be refined over multiple\nturns. In applications such as finance and business analytics, users\niteratively adjust query constraints or dimensions based on intermediate\nresults. To evaluate such dynamic capabilities, we introduce DySQL-Bench, a\nbenchmark assessing model performance under evolving user interactions. Unlike\nprevious manually curated datasets, DySQL-Bench is built through an automated\ntwo-stage pipeline of task synthesis and verification. Structured tree\nrepresentations derived from raw database tables guide LLM-based task\ngeneration, followed by interaction-oriented filtering and expert validation.\nHuman evaluation confirms 100% correctness of the synthesized data. We further\npropose a multi-turn evaluation framework simulating realistic interactions\namong an LLM-simulated user, the model under test, and an executable database.\nThe model must adapt its reasoning and SQL generation as user intents change.\nDySQL-Bench covers 13 domains across BIRD and Spider 2 databases, totaling\n1,072 tasks.

Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and\nattribute disentanglement.

However,\ncurrent OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS\ninvolves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,\nand (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a\ncritical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,\ncompiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we\npresent OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured\nmanagement and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly\nintegrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models\n(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we\nconstruct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,\nwhich is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,\ncleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M\nsingle-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent\nleverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in\nretrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior\nperformance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,\nsurpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,\nGPT-4o).

To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faWOD-E2E\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8<0.03%\u53d1\u751f\u9891\u7387\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u7684Waymo\u57fa\u51c6\u96c6\uff084021\u6bb5\uff0c\u224812\u5c0f\u65f6\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165RFS\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e2025\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709E2E\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u51c6\u591a\u4e3a\u5e38\u89c4\u60c5\u5f62\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u6709\u590d\u6742\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53cd\u6620\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9a7e\u9a76\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u957f\u5c3e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eWaymo Open Dataset\u7cbe\u9009\u5e76\u6807\u6ce8\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u9a7e\u9a76\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u4ee58\u8def\u76f8\u673a360\u89c6\u89d2\u3001\u8def\u7531\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0eego\u72b6\u6001\u6784\u6210\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u7528RFS\u8861\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u6ce8\u957f\u5c3e\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6WOD-E2E\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807Rater Feedback Score (RFS)\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b4021\u6bb5\u7ea612\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u5c42\u5bfc\u822a\u3001ego\u72b6\u6001\u548c8\u8def360\u5ea6\u73af\u89c6\u76f8\u673a\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u9644\u5e26\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u3002", "conclusion": "WOD-E2E\u548cRFS\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709E2E\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9a7e\u9a76\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,\neach part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,\nenabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a\ncenter-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when\nexchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby\nmaintaining global coherence.

In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the\nmost common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,\nrickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto\n(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of\nauto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from\naccessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite\ndifficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially\nnon-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This\npaper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect\nauto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object\ndetection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of\n1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The\nresults show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw\ndetection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values\nabove 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse\ntraffic scenarios.

Researchers have investigated various\nmethods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including\nblur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are\noften of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we\npropose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework\nusing Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion\nrepresentations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality\nfrom a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key\ncomponents: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale\nfeature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new\ntraining method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained\nmotion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a\nmotion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach\nleveraging a \"learn from synthesis\" strategy. First, a diffusion model is\ntrained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human\nposes, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process\nenables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k\naccurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building\non this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for\nestimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework\ncombines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch\nfeature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose\nestimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee\ngeometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses\nwhile preserving accurate self-contacts.

The management of risks that occur\nin a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the\nsustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the\nsupply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential\nelement in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in\nthe context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed\nto analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to\npropose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric\nnetwork (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This\nnetwork is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to\nderive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the\nproposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The\nSupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction\nof delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The\nproduct classification and edge classification are performed using the\nSupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An\naverage accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk\nmanagement.

Concretely,\nCATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates\nmode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning\nsignals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit\nconstraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the\ngenerated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,\nCATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during\ngeneration, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the\nNavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and\nwas honored with the Innovation Award.", "AI": {"tldr": "CATG\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u65bd\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u5728NavSim v2\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u7f29\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5165\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c4\u5212\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08Constrained Flow Matching\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u65bd\u52a0\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u5c06\u9a7e\u9a76\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728NavSim v2\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faCATG\uff08Constrained Flow Matching\uff09\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5e76\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u7f29\u3001\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u9a7e\u9a76\u6fc0\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728NavSim v2\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u7b2c\u4e8c\u540d\uff0cEPDMS\u4e3a51.31\u5e76\u83b7\u521b\u65b0\u5956\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u5f0f\u574d\u7f29\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8f68\u8ff9\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6311\u6218\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their\nreal-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework\nintegrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our\nbenchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and\n$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to\n$300$ imaging tasks.

To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first\nlarge-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.\nBuilding upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based\nscheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A\ndedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and\noperational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative\nlearning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution\nfor AEOS constellation scheduling.

To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early\ndetection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently\nestablished based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer\n(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of\nexisting methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One\npotential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of\nbackbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them\n(\\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global\nfeature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to\neffectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the\ntheory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm\ntransforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via\na set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the\naggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively\ntune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the\nperformance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly\navailable DR grading datasets.

Under review as\n  a conference paper at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from\nsurveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because\nrecovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable\ndownstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by\nOCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and\nscene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these\ncomponents on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.\nAcross SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by\nup to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)\nwhile maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ.

However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,\nour approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural\ndistribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide\nextensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding\nof A-TPT.

Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability\nof pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous\nregions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.\nHowever, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can\nonly pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to\nidentify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment\nbetween image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving\nsub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose\nthe Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and\nfine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with\nautomatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel\nframework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,\nwhich consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and\nMulti-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics\ninto multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and\nconcatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and\nmulti-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align\nwith corresponding visual regions.

However, we\nidentify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating\nhigh-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles\nwith more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced\noptimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while\nhindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks.

However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,\nthe global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect\nthe high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a\nscale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional\nlong-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the\nconsistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic\nlevel affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform\nsemantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a\nTransformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a\nfeature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method\nimproves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior\nsegmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we\nintroduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization\ntechniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection\nproblem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video\nsummarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach\nemphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we\ndevelop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of\nvideo frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being\nselected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific\ndatasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of\n30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns.

In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for\ncross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while\nrequiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to\ndecouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight\nmodules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual\nadapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a\nVisual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically\ninjected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone\nmodel. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without\nretraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on\nMedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH\nprovides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling\npractical deployment across diverse application domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "CATCH\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00/\u89c6\u89c9\u53cc\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u7684\u8de8\u57dfVQA\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3b\u5e72\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684VQA\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9065\u611f\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u3001\u6570\u5b66\u56fe\u8868\u7b49\u57df\u5916\u5206\u5e03\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9010\u57df\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u7ba1\u7ebf\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7c7b\u578b\uff1b2) \u53cc\u9002\u914d\u5668\u673a\u5236\uff1aPrompt Adapter\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u8282\uff0cVisual Adapter\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u6574\uff1b3) \u7edf\u4e00hook\u63a5\u53e3\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u5165\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3b\u5e72\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9aVQA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\uff1aMathVQA +2.3 BLEU\uff0cMedVQA-RAD +2.6 VQA\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u6307\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6216\u5206\u6570\uff09\uff0cChartQA +3.1 ROUGE\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "CATCH\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u52a8\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u548c\u53cc\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff08Prompt Adapter\u4e0eVisual Adapter\uff09\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347VQA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u6027\u597d\u4e14\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u3002"}}

However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object\ndetection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in\nComputer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable\nprogress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains\nfragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative\nintelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking\nanalysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as\nVision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI\nrather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically\nreviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,\nand Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their\ncapabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their\npotential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception\nframeworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that\nmoves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,\nand cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a\ncross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze\ncutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to\nhybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven\napproaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language\nModels (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey\ndelivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future\nopportunities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u56f4\u7ed5\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u91cd\u6784\u4e0eVLM/LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u4e0e\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u6563\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u6574\u5408\u6700\u65b0\u7684VLM/LLM/\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4ee5\u5f62\u6210\u9762\u5411\u672a\u6765\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\u3002", "method": "Survey + Vision-Language-Centric Analysis", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u5176\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u8f66/\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd/\u534f\u540c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e862D/3D/\u6df7\u5408\u4e0eTransformer\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6307\u51faVLM/LLM\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c06VLM/LLM\u4e0e\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u534f\u540c\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\u662f\u672a\u6765\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u547c\u5401\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u5b9e\u7528\u5316\u3002"}}

Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework\nthat systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key\npillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a\nlarge-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that\nintegrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions\nfrom web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen\nmodels. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion\ntriplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose\nViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from\nMoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance\nefficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that\neliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong\ngeneralization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed\nfor fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and\ngeneralization ability.
