*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文构建了一个将能力增长与物理和信息资源（功率、带宽、内存）及投资耦合的可测框架，导出可根据现有观测数据判定是否会出现有限时间内的‘奇点’并提出可实现的安全控制措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a precise, testable framework to determine whether AI capability can escalate without bound in finite time (a 'runaway' or singularity) by linking capability growth to measurable resources and constraints.

Method: 建立服务包络（基于功率、带宽、内存）限制瞬时改进；构建内生增长模型将资本与计算、数据、能量耦合；导出判定规则把设施功率、IO带宽、训练吞吐、基准损失、支出等观测序列映射为二元证书；分析多种情形下包络是否成为瓶颈并给出可执行控制。

Result: An analytic, simulation-free framework that defines a resource-constrained service envelope and an endogenous growth model; decision rules map observable metrics into certificates for runaway vs nonsingular behavior; proposes practical controls (power caps, throttling, evaluation gates); provides falsifiable tests and case studies (capped-power, saturating-data, investment-amplified).

Conclusion: 在可测资源与部署政策约束下，可以通过观察现有指标的加速率来证明或排除有限时间内的能力发散；工程可行的限制（如功率上限、吞吐限制、评估门控）能作为安全手段；模型依赖能力度量和正则性诊断，需进一步扩展到随机性、多智能体及架构突变。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个可用于训练与评估视觉-语言模型的帧级自动驾驶数据集，以支持可解释的场景级理解与风险感知场景检索。

Method: 建立28键类/子类知识库并定义350+叶属性与严重度量表；采用GPT-4o视觉语言辅助生成标签，结合人工-in-the-loop核验与后处理规则；构建属性共现图与JSONL记录；使用LoRA微调Qwen2-VL-2B作为基线并提供准确率、列表属性F1、严重度MAE/RMSE等评估脚本。

Result: 发布CAR-Scenes数据集：5,192张来自Argoverse1、Cityscapes、KITTI、nuScenes的图像，使用28类目知识库、350+叶属性、1-10离散严重度标度，通过GPT-4o辅助标注并人工核验，提供共现图、JSONL记录、标注与分析脚本，以及基线模型（如LoRA微调的Qwen2-VL-2B）在固定验证集上的评估指标。

Conclusion: CAR-Scenes为数据驱动、可解释的自动驾驶场景理解提供了开放资源，包含完整标注流程与评估工具，有助于开发风险感知与语义检索的VLM应用。

Abstract: CAR-Scenes is a frame-level dataset for autonomous driving that enables training and evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs) for interpretable, scene-level understanding. We annotate 5,192 images drawn from Argoverse 1, Cityscapes, KITTI, and nuScenes using a 28-key category/sub-category knowledge base covering environment, road geometry, background-vehicle behavior, ego-vehicle behavior, vulnerable road users, sensor states, and a discrete severity scale (1-10), totaling 350+ leaf attributes. Labels are produced by a GPT-4o-assisted vision-language pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification; we release the exact prompts, post-processing rules, and per-field baseline model performance. CAR-Scenes also provides attribute co-occurrence graphs and JSONL records that support semantic retrieval, dataset triage, and risk-aware scenario mining across sources. To calibrate task difficulty, we include reproducible, non-benchmark baselines, notably a LoRA-tuned Qwen2-VL-2B with deterministic decoding, evaluated via scalar accuracy, micro-averaged F1 for list attributes, and severity MAE/RMSE on a fixed validation split. We publicly release the annotation and analysis scripts, including graph construction and evaluation scripts, to enable explainable, data-centric workflows for future intelligent vehicles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本生成-图像模型的数据归因计算量大，不适合实际应用，需一种可扩展、实时的归因检索方案。

Method: 用慢的unlearning归因器生成训练图像影响标签或相似性信号，然后训练一个嵌入网络使得在该空间内邻近的训练图像与归因器判定的高影响力图像一致；部署时使用向量索引（如FAISS）进行快速检索。

Result: They distill an expensive unlearning-based attribution into an embedding space for fast retrieval; achieves huge speedups and competitive/better accuracy on MSCOCO and LAION/Stable Diffusion.

Conclusion: 方法能在不运行昂贵归因算法的前提下，快速检索出高影响力训练图像，为大规模现实模型的数据归因提供可行路径。

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColoWorkflow通过Delphi共识形成并在多中心视频集上验证，具备良好适用性和中等至良好的评估者一致性，可用于标准化结直肠微创手术视频工作流分析，支持培训标准化和AI识别研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创结直肠手术存在流程变异大、学习曲线陡峭与并发症影响预后等问题；视频基础评估可用数据驱动方法降低差异、优化培训并提升手术质量，但现有工作流工具难以标准化与推广。

Method: 采用Delphi共识法制定通用工作流描述符，形成10个手术阶段和34个步骤的框架；据此开发ColoWorkflow，并让独立评估者对来自5个中心、54个结直肠手术视频（腹腔镜与机器人）进行标注，评估适用性与评估者间信度（Cohen's K）。

Result: 达成对10个阶段和34个步骤的共识；在54个手术视频中除1个标签外全部被使用；评估者间信度为阶段平均Cohen's K=0.71，步骤平均K=0.66，主要分歧出现在阶段转换和步骤边界定义。

Conclusion: 本文开发并验证了ColoWorkflow，一种针对微创结直肠手术的共识驱动视频工作流分析工具，证明其广泛适用且具备中等以上评分一致性，从而可用于跨中心基准评估与AI工作流识别研究。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

### [5] [Frequency-Aware Vision-Language Multimodality Generalization Network for Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10774)
*Junjie Zhang,Feng Zhao,Hanqiang Liu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FVMGN，一种结合扩散增强、小波频域解耦、专有+共享类文本、空间-频率图像编码与多尺度对齐的遥感多模态泛化网络，显著提升跨场景分类泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感影像存在多模态差异与跨场景分布漂移，且现有VLMs使用通用文本缺乏针对遥感视觉模态的专有语言先验，导致跨模态泛化性能不足。需要结合频域信息与专有语言设计以提升多模态跨场景泛化。

Method: 提出FVMGN：包括（1）基于扩散的训练-测试时增强（DTAug）用于重建多模态土地覆盖分布；（2）多模态小波解耦（MWDis）在频域重采样低高频以学习跨域不变特征；（3）共享与专有类文本输入用于变换器文本编码器提取多样化文本特征；（4）空间-频率感知图像编码器（SFIE）用于局部-全局特征重构；（5）多尺度空间-频率特征对齐（MSFFA）用于构建统一语义空间并在空间与频域对不同模态特征进行精细对齐。

Result: 通过大量实验，FVMGN在多个遥感多模态分类任务上显著优于SOTA方法，证明其在多模态泛化能力、跨域不变特征学习及多尺度空间-频率对齐方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种面向遥感多模态泛化（RSMG）的网络FVMGN，能够在跨场景、跨模态分布差异下提升遥感影像分类的泛化能力。通过频域上的特征解耦与对齐、扩充的语义文本设计以及空间-频率联合的图像编码，模型实现了多尺度、多频段的视觉-语言对齐，实验表明优于现有SOTA方法。

Abstract: The booming remote sensing (RS) technology is giving rise to a novel multimodality generalization task, which requires the model to overcome data heterogeneity while possessing powerful cross-scene generalization ability. Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments show that FVMGN has the excellent multimodality generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

### [6] [GFT: Graph Feature Tuning for Efficient Point Cloud Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10799)
*Manish Dhakal,Venkat R. Dasari,Raj Sunderraman,Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GFT：用轻量级图卷积从token构建动态图并通过跳跃连接与跨注意力注入Transformer，达到在点云任务上用更少可训练参数维持竞争性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用的PEFT方法在点云任务上表现次优，且现有点云专用方法仍有进一步减少可训练参数的空间；因此提出GFT以在更少参数开销下保持或接近原模型性能。

Method: GFT首先对点云进行token化，利用轻量级图卷积网络动态构建邻接关系与图特征；随后通过跳跃连接将这些图特征注入到Transformer的深层，并使用高效的跨注意力模块融合图特征与Transformer特征；训练时仅更新图卷积网络和少量跨注意力相关参数，实现参数高效微调。

Result: 在多个物体分类和分割基准上，GFT在相同域下与已有点云PEFT方法性能可比，同时可训练参数更少，展示了在参数效率与任务性能之间的良好折衷。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种针对点云数据的参数高效微调方法Graph Features Tuning（GFT），通过轻量级图卷积网络从初始token构建动态图，并将图特征通过跳跃连接和高效交叉注意力模块传递给深层，从而在减少可训练参数的同时保持性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters, enabling faster adaptation to new tasks with minimal loss in performance. Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于LRP的剪枝方法，针对数据稀缺场景在保持准确率的前提下实现更高的剪枝率。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-video training misses fine-grained temporal cues; need real-time detection and better labeling for rapid events

Method: Short-Window Sliding Learning; LLM-based auto-caption labeling; full-frame short clips

Result: 95.25% on RWF-2000; 83.25% on UCF-Crime; improved generalization and real-time applicability

Conclusion: Short-window sliding with LLM auto-labels yields precise, real-time violence detection and better performance on long videos

Abstract: This paper proposes a Short-Window Sliding Learning framework for real-time violence detection in CCTV footages. Unlike conventional long-video training approaches, the proposed method divides videos into 1-2 second clips and applies Large Language Model (LLM)-based auto-caption labeling to construct fine-grained datasets. Each short clip fully utilizes all frames to preserve temporal continuity, enabling precise recognition of rapid violent events. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 95.25\% accuracy on RWF-2000 and significantly improves performance on long videos (UCF-Crime: 83.25\%), confirming its strong generalization and real-time applicability in intelligent surveillance systems.

Conclusion: MCN-CL有效缓解了模态异质性和类别不平衡问题，提升了多模态情感识别性能，适用于社交媒体场景的大规模多模态数据

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Conclusion: 提出的GhostHead能在轻量化模型上提升检测精度和速度，在无人机视角小目标检测场景中有效，但增益幅度有限且需更多细节和统计验证。

Abstract: Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement. These results indicate that YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed compared to YOLOv11. To further validate its reliability, comparative experiments were conducted against other high-performance object detection models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10. The results confirmed that the proposed model outperformed YOLOv8 by 0.1% in mAP (0.5) and surpassed YOLOv9 and YOLOv10 by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively.

### [12] [PhaseWin Search Framework Enable Efficient Object-Level Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10914)
*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin 通过相位窗口的粗到细搜索与自适应机制，把贪心子集归因的成本从二次降到近线性，能以 20% 的预算实现 >95% 的忠实度，适用于目标检测与视觉指向的对象级模型归因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于次模子集选择的归因方法尽管忠实度高，但计算代价高（贪心选择为二次复杂度），难以在实际场景中部署，需一种高效且保持忠实度的替代方案。

Method: 提出 PhaseWin 相位窗口搜索算法：用分阶段粗到细的搜索替代传统二次代价的贪心子集选择；结合自适应剪枝、窗口化的细粒度选择和动态监督机制，近似贪心行为但显著降低模型调用。

Result: 在理论上保留近贪心逼近保证；在实证上用 20% 的计算预算达到超过 95% 的贪心归因忠实度，并在 Grounding DINO 与 Florence-2 的目标检测和视觉指向任务上优于其他基线，成为可扩展且高忠实度的对象级多模态模型归因新指标。

Conclusion: PhaseWin 能在保留近似贪心选择理论保证的前提下，将区域归因的计算复杂度降至近线性，从而在保持高忠实度的同时大幅减少模型评估次数。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

Conclusion: PNS能有效教会负提示捕捉类间边界信息并将其传到视觉模态，显著提升能量基OOD检测性能，在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: YOLOv12n is more sensitive (higher mAP) especially on clean KDEF and FER2013; YOLOv11n attains higher precision on noisy FER2013, indicating fewer false positives. Trade-off: sensitivity vs precision; both are suitable for real-time, resource-limited FER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve FER in real-world, resource-constrained settings by assessing lightweight YOLO nano variants for unified detection and classification to enable real-time emotion-aware AI.

Method: Converted FER2013 and KDEF to object detection format; trained YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n within unified detection+classification pipeline; evaluated using mAP@0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

Result: The paper evaluates YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n for facial expression recognition by converting classification datasets into detection format and measuring mAP@0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.

Conclusion: Lightweight YOLO nano models can balance performance and efficiency for FER; YOLOv12n better for sensitivity and clean data; YOLOv11n more precise in noisy conditions. Both adaptable across controlled and real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCD通过融合和分解共享logits，将教师和学生的互补特征结合并用正交约束分离子logits，从而在异构结构蒸馏中实现更有效的知识传递，实验表明优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统KD主要针对同构网络，难以处理ViT到ResNet等异构结构间的空间表示差异。现有异构KD方法要么复杂且计算昂贵，要么过度依赖logit对齐，限制了互补特征的利用。

Conclusion: HCD通过在共享logits上融合教师和学生的互补特征，并将其分解为子logits进行约束，有效缓解了异构结构蒸馏中空间特征差异的问题，从而提升了学生模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中来自不同扫描仪或协议导致的特征异质性问题，尤其在医疗图像分割任务中，由于多机构数据无法共享，现有方法侧重于最终层特征矢量对齐，忽视多层次上下文信息和中间层风格偏差累积，从而影响全局模型的稳健性与性能。

Conclusion: FedBCS通过解耦内容-风格并在多层次融合上下文原型，有效缓解了域间风格差异和中间层偏差累积，提高了联邦学习的泛化性与分割精度，适用于跨机构医疗影像协同训练。

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

TL;DR: Introduce SandboxVLM: use abstract bounding-box-based 3D abstraction pipeline to augment VLMs for better 3D reasoning without extra training, achieving consistent zero-shot gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs trained on 2D data lack 3D spatial and physical reasoning needed for robotics/embodied agents; need to bridge modality gap to retrieve 3D information from 2D inputs.

Method: Create abstract bounding-box representations from images via multi-view priors with abstract control, estimate proxy elevations, perform multi-view voting and clustering to reconstruct 3D Sandbox, then perform 3D-aware reasoning by feeding abstractions to VLMs for enhanced spatial and physical inference.

Result: SandboxVLM uses abstract bounding boxes and a four-stage 3D Sandbox pipeline (multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, 3D-aware reasoning) to encode geometry and kinematics, boosting zero-shot spatial intelligence across benchmarks and VLM backbones, e.g., +8.3% on SAT Real.

Conclusion: Providing VLMs with simple 3D abstractions significantly improves their spatial reasoning and 3D understanding in zero-shot settings, enabling better performance for embodied intelligence tasks without retraining.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D-related tasks such as spatial cognition and physical understanding, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and embodied agents. We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 现有MER面临静态外观与动态运动线索纠缠，以及文本标签与面部肌肉运动之间的语义差距；引入MLLM需解决对细微运动的聚焦和文本-运动对齐问题。

Method: 构建Uni-MER（基于光流和AU标签的运动驱动指令数据集），并设计三专家架构（结构、动态纹理、运动语义）以解耦面部动态，把指令对齐知识注入到大语言模型中进行跨模态推理。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准上实现SOTA性能，并在局部面部运动的可解释建模上表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM在多个微表情基准上达到了最先进性能，能更精确地捕捉细微情绪线索并提供局部面部运动的可解释建模优势。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Conclusion: LGRLN能更好保留时序与上下文依赖、过滤语义无关帧并支持文本引导的摘要生成，同时显著降低模型规模与推理时间。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video content on social media, video summarization has become a crucial task in multimedia processing. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/LGRLN.

Conclusion: TG-DFER在弱监督设定下通过语义引导与时序一致性建模，能更准确地定位情绪相关帧并捕捉多尺度动态，从而提高DFER的性能、解释性与时间敏感度。

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

TL;DR: ERMoE通过在专家中使用正交特征基并以余弦相似度进行路由，稳定分配、促进可解释专业化、无需负载平衡损失，从而在图像分类、图文检索和3D MRI任务上取得显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MoE架构中路由不稳定和专家利用不足的问题，以及负载不均导致的性能瓶颈

Method: 对每个专家学习正交本征基（eigenbasis），用输入与该基的余弦相似度作为路由分数，按相似度选择专家，避免额外负载平衡损失并保持稀疏性

Result: ERMoE将每个专家用学习到的正交特征基重参数化，并用“特征基相似度”替代路由logit，消除显式负载平衡损失，提升分类与检索任务表现并自然均衡负载

Conclusion: ERMoE为稀疏专家模型引入了基于专家表示空间的路由原则，解决路由不稳定与负载不均问题，带来可扩展且可解释的专家专业化和更好性能

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

TL;DR: DMC decouples vision encoder and text prompt training to preserve cross-modal alignment; DMC-OT uses optimal transport to align stored Gaussian replay statistics when the encoder evolves, yielding SOTA CIL performance for CLIP-based models


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent catastrophic forgetting and classifier bias when learning new class soft prompts without prior data by using one modality as stable anchor and calibrating memory statistics across evolving encoders

Method: Two-stage decoupled adaptation with modality freezing

Result: Proposed DMC and DMC-OT; DMC decouples encoder adaptation and prompt optimization with alternating frozen training; DMC-OT adds optimal-transport guided calibration for memory statistics and task-specific prompting; both achieve SOTA on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, CUB-200, UCF-101, with DMC-OT improving accuracy by ~1.80%

Conclusion: Decoupling modalities and calibrating memory via optimal transport effectively mitigate bias and distribution drift in CLIP-based class-incremental learning, improving accuracy and maintaining cross-modal alignment

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

TL;DR: 提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS)，通过对不同head施加相反小相位偏移并聚合输出，平滑RoPE在时间维度的高频波动，提高视频LLM对帧时间微小位移的鲁棒性，无需训练且开销极小，在多个基准上改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLM对帧时间的小位移敏感，注意力会被不相关帧抑制，源于将RoPE扩展到时间维时产生的相位相关振铃，需一个简单有效的方法消除或减弱这种相位敏感性。

Method: 分析Multimodal RoPE导致的逆傅里叶时间核含有帧尺度振铃，提出在不同attention heads上施加小且相反的相位偏移，再对heads输出求平均来平滑时间核（多相位平均），保留每个head的频谱幅值。证明平滑后的核使注意力对时间微小偏移满足Lipschitz稳定性。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准上、在相同token预算下，PAS带来稳定且一致的性能提升，计算开销可忽略，且在Nyquist有效采样下多相位平均能衰减高频振铃同时保留每个head的幅谱。

Conclusion: PAS 是一种简单、免训练、低成本的改进，可插拔地缓解Multimodal RoPE在时间维度引起的振铃不稳定性，从而提升视频理解任务的时序鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

<details>

Motivation: improve zero-shot vision accuracy of off-the-shelf VLMs without training by transforming open-ended queries into verifiable formats

Method: training-free binary verification workflow

Result: quantization to MCQ yields large gains; True/False binarization gives consistent additional boost; workflow improves performance across REC, spatial reasoning, BLINK-Jigsaw

Conclusion: 通过量化和布尔化，能将开放式视觉查询转为可验证问题，形成一个简单通用的推理阶段改进方案，显著提升零样本VLM性能

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

Result: 在自然、卫星和医学图像数据集上进行实验，方法在压缩率上达到新的最优，并在参数量小、编码速度具有竞争力的前提下，实现了比现有方法显著的提升，特别是在无损压缩基准上树立新标杆。

Conclusion: 本文重新审视自回归模型在无损图像压缩中的可行性，提出了一个基于层级并行和渐进自适应的实用框架，使纯自回归方法在性能和效率上都达到新的最优。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出CLUE，一种在小样本医学领域通过固定格式prompt和无额外数据实现多样且稳定图像生成的框架，基于Stable Diffusion，加入Style Encoder和U-Net第二注意力层，通过KL散度约束潜空间为高斯区域并实现与prompt无关的连续表征，在中耳炎数据集上显著提升FID、recall和分类F1，作为数据增强能提升下游分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成方法在医学等专业领域受限于数据种类少、数量不足，现有依赖大规模prompt-image数据或额外模态的数据扩充方法难以适用，需一种无需额外数据且能保持生成多样性和稳定性的方案。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion，CLUE引入一个Style Encoder，将图像与固定格式prompt编码为style embedding，并将其注入U-Net的新增第二注意力层；通过KL散度约束潜在空间，使图像特征在高斯区域内连续表征；评估指标包含FID、recall和下游分类F1，且进行了不同比例的合成数据训练对比实验。

Result: 在中耳炎数据集上CLUE将FID从46.81降到9.30，recall从49.60%升到70.29%；用1000%规模的合成-only数据训练的分类器F1为83.21%（对比73.83%），与等量真实数据混合训练F1为94.76%，并在外部数据集上显示合成only和混合训练均优于仅内部数据训练。

Conclusion: CLUE在有限数据的专业领域能实现多样且稳定的图像生成，显著改善生成质量（低FID、高recall）并用作有效的数据增强，提高分类器在内部和外部数据集上的F1，证明了无需额外数据也能通过模型架构和潜空间约束提升生成与下游性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

Conclusion: PROMISE能有效弥合完整与不完整模态表示差距，显著改善缺模态场景下的多模态表示

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

TL;DR: 提出EmoVid数据集并在Wan2.1上实现情感条件微调，显著提升创意媒体视频的情感表现与生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成系统侧重低层次视觉指标，忽视了情感维度；视觉领域虽有情感分析进展，但视频生成社区缺乏针对创意/非写实视频的情感数据与方法，限制了生成内容的情感表达与控制。

Method: 构建一个包含卡通动画、电影片段和动图贴纸的多模态视频数据集（EmoVid），对视频进行情感标签、视觉属性（亮度、色彩丰富度、色相）和文本字幕标注；分析视觉特征与情感感知之间的时空关联；基于这些分析对Wan2.1模型进行情感条件微调以实现情感驱动的视频生成（text-to-video 和 image-to-video）。

Result: 通过在EmoVid上训练和评估，情感条件生成在定量指标和主观视觉质量上均有显著提升；数据分析揭示了视觉属性与情感标签之间的显著空间和时间模式；EmoVid成为情感视频计算的新基准数据集。

Conclusion: EmoVid填补了创意媒体中视频情感理解与生成之间的空白，通过构建情感标注的数据集并将情感条件融入视频生成，提升了生成视频的情感表达能力和视觉质量。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

Motivation: 现有MIL依赖注意力机制缺乏因果可解释性，且未整合人口统计学导致算法偏见，影响临床部署，MeCaMIL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 在MIL中显式构建因果图，将人口统计学视为混杂因子，通过do-calculus与利用碰撞子（collider）结构来分离病理相关信号与人口统计学相关的表面特征；在训练和评估中比较标准MIL与消融模型，并扩展到生存分析。

Result: MeCaMIL提出通过结构化因果图建模人口统计学混杂因子，从而在MIL框架中实现可解释性和公平性。基于do-calculus与碰撞子结构来去相关人口统计学与疾病信号，提升分类与生存预测性能，同时显著减少群体间差异。

Conclusion: MeCaMIL在三个数据集上实现高性能（CAMELYON16, TCGA-Lung, TCGA-Multi），并显著降低人口统计学不公平性，且因果结构对结果至关重要。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology, achieving strong diagnostic performance through patch-level feature aggregation. However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology. Code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 LVLM 容易依赖语言先验产生未依据视觉证据的回答（幻觉），缺乏定量评估模型在推理中使用视觉信息程度的方法，因而需要一种可测量并能引导模型更多利用视觉证据的框架。

Method: 设计问题条件化的相关性映射定位问题相关线索；基于相关性进行概率遮掩以测量利用度；引入 Draft and Refine 代理：先生成初稿，再借助外部视觉专家（框、掩码等）渲染提示并重新询问模型，选择提升利用度最大的回答作为最终输出。

Result: 在多个 VQA 与图像描述基准上，DnR 在不改动模型结构或重训练的情况下稳健提升准确率并降低幻觉，证明可视化利用度度量能有效指导更有证据支持的多模态推理。

Conclusion: DnR 提出了一种在不改变模型或重训练的前提下，基于问题条件化的可视化利用度度量，通过构建相关性图和概率遮掩来量化模型对视觉证据的依赖，并利用外部视觉专家的定向反馈对初稿进行迭代优化，能够提高视觉对齐性并减少幻觉。

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address VLMs' loss of visual grounding and contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation by introducing a memory mechanism inspired by human cognitive memory theory.

Method: Design dynamic latent vision memories aligned with short-term (fine-grained perceptual retention) and long-term (abstract semantic consolidation) memory systems, integrate them into VLMs to be invoked during inference, and evaluate across diverse visual benchmarks.

Result: VisMem, a framework with dynamic latent vision memories (short-term for perceptual details, long-term for semantic consolidation) invoked during inference, yielding 11.8% average performance boost over vanilla models and outperforming counterparts.

Conclusion: VisMem establishes a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement in VLMs, maintaining perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency and improving performance across understanding, reasoning, and generation benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

TL;DR: SP-Guard通过提示词有害性估计与选择性引导掩码，在保持图像完整性的前提下更有效地阻止不安全内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理阶段的引导方法在强度和选择性上不足，容易过度修改图像或未能针对性阻止有害内容生成，因此需要一种既自适应又选择性的安全引导机制。

Method: 首先对提示词进行有害性评分以实现自适应调整，然后在生成过程中构造选择性引导掩码，仅在被判定为不安全的图像区域施加引导，减少对其他区域的影响。

Result: 实验表明，SP-Guard在生成更安全图像的同时，较少改变本不应被修改的内容，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出SP-Guard，通过估计提示词的有害性并对图像中仅不安全区域施加选择性引导，实现更安全的扩散式文本到图像生成。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

*Siheon Joo,Hongjo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce SUPER, a wavelet-PR inspired decoder block that preserves high-frequency details and suppresses redundancy, plug-and-play for U-Nets; improves thin-crack segmentation and yields PSNR gains with similar cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U-Net skip connections still lose high-frequency details; need reconstruction-aware decoder that suppresses redundant features while preserving information.

Method: Wavelet-based decoder block called SUPER integrates perfect reconstruction and selective suppression to reduce info loss in U-Net decoders.

Result: SUPER as a plug-and-play decoder block improves thin-crack segmentation (<4px) and gives moderate PSNR gains on SIDD; maintains comparable computational cost and increases representational diversity via more parameters.

Conclusion: SUPER removes U-Net decoder bottlenecks by leveraging PR property and selective suppression, offering enhanced high-frequency fidelity and generality across tasks without heavy computational overhead.

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: 结合多焦点3D感知表示与基于语义与边界的条件注入，扩散式去噪可显著提升胚胎发育分期识别的准确性与抗遮挡性，且在效率上有优势（单步去噪达到最优）。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是探究深度学习模型是否会从医疗影像中学到与社会经济地位相关的“隐形”信息，检验医学影像是否真的中性，以及这对公平性和模型部署的潜在影响。

Method: 作者使用多种主流模型（DenseNet121、SwinV2-B、MedMamba），在MIMIC-CXR-JPG和CheXpert数据集上训练分类器预测患者的医保类型，控制年龄、种族和性别变量，并进行补丁遮挡（patch-based occlusion）可视化分析以定位信号分布。

Result: 结果显示模型在两个数据集上均能显著预测医保类型（AUC约0.67–0.68），信号在控制人口学变量后仍存在，并在单一种族子集上可检测到。遮挡分析显示信号是弥散性的，主要分布于上胸和中胸区域。

Conclusion: 该论文结论是：深度视觉模型能从胸部X光中检测到与社会经济地位相关的隐含信号（通过医保类型作为代理），表明医学影像并非中性生物数据，模型在学习疾病的同时也会学习社会分层信息，这对医疗AI的公平性提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

Method: 提出两级缓存：1）块级粗粒度缓存基于特征重用，按块跳过编码器-解码器在不同推理步骤间的重复计算；2）提示级细粒度缓存复用连续推理步骤间的跨注意力图，并扩展到相邻步骤的模块计算。将两者无缝嵌入可控生成流程的各计算环节。

Result: 提出了一种混合粒度缓存（HGC）策略，通过在模型不同计算阶段采用块级（粗粒度）与提示级（细粒度）缓存来复用特征与跨注意力图，从而显著降低可控生成模型的计算开销并保持视觉质量。

Conclusion: HGC有效平衡生成效率与视觉质量，在多个基准数据集上显著降低MACs同时仅带来极小的性能下降，适用于需要高效可控合成的场景。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Conclusion: 本文提出的MPCGNet通过耦合门三模块协同工作，有效缓解了小尺寸息肉遗漏、边界模糊和图像噪声问题，提高了分割性能。实验在ETIS-LaribPolypDB及CVC-ColonDB上取得了优于近期网络的mDice提升，证明方法有效。

Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.

*Pooja Singh,Siddhant Ujjain,Tapan Kumar Gandhi,Sandeep Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossMed用MAT框架把四个医疗影像数据集转为VQA任务，测试多模态LLM在组合性泛化上的能力，发现相关训练下性能好但对组合外情形泛化差，且展示了跨任务迁移潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大模型在医疗领域显示潜力，但缺乏系统化评估其在模态、解剖部位与任务三要素组合上的泛化能力；需要一个基准来测试零样本、跨任务与模态无关的泛化性。

Method: 将四个公开数据集（CheXpert、SIIM-ACR、BraTS 2020、MosMedData）统一为VQA多项选择格式，总计20,200条样本；按Related、Unrelated及零重叠划分MAT三元组；在LLaVA-Vicuna-7B和Qwen2-VL-7B上评估，同时对比ResNet-50与U-Net；测量分类准确率与分割cIoU。

Result: 在Related划分下多模态LLM分类准确率83.2%，分割cIoU 0.75；在Unrelated与零重叠设置性能大幅下降；跨任务训练（仅分类数据）能将分割cIoU提升约7%；传统模型改进有限。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了CrossMed基准，通过MAT（Modality-Anatomy-Task）结构化方案，评估医疗多模态大模型的组合性泛化能力，结论是现有开源多模态LLM在相关训练下表现良好，但在无关或零重叠设置下性能显著下降；跨任务迁移可提升分割性能；传统模型有一定收益但不及多模态LLM。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

Conclusion: SemanticNN在极受限设备与不稳定信道下，实现了高压缩率与高语义保真，显著降低传输开销并保持推理性能，适合实际IoT设备-边缘协同部署。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/liwrui/H2ARN.

Result: PINGS-X: axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representation with normalized Gaussian splatting, convergence guarantee, axes-aligned Gaussians, and Gaussian merging; yields much faster training and better super-resolution on CFD and real 4D flow MRI

Conclusion: PINGS-X在CFD和真实4D flow MRI上实现了更快训练和更高超分辨率精度，适合临床快速成像应用并开源代码和数据

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NP-LoRA：通过SVD提取主方向并将主题LoRA投影到风格LoRA的零空间（含软投影），有效避免LoRA融合中的结构性干扰，提升融合效果且无需重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于权重合并的方法在融合时常被某一LoRA主导，导致干扰和保真度下降；需要一种不需重训练即可减少结构性干扰的融合方法。

Method: 通过对LoRA权重做SVD，提取风格主方向，然后将主题LoRA投影到风格LoRA的零空间，且引入软投影控制主题保真与风格一致性的权衡。

Result: 在多种基线与评估指标（DINO、CLIP、人工与LLM偏好评分）上，NP-LoRA在不重训练的情况下显著提高了融合质量，且适用于不同主干网络与LoRA对。

Conclusion: 本文发现LoRA融合中的结构性干扰主要来自低秩子空间的主方向重叠，提出通过空间投影保持主方向正交以减少干扰，从而提升融合质量。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

Motivation: 现有的生成图像合成方法难以同时兼顾细节保留和前景姿态/视角调整。利用多张参考图像并对其特征进行校准，可以提供更多正确姿态/视角的线索，从而改善合成质量。

Method: 将生成合成模型扩展为多参考版本，允许输入任意数量的前景参考图像；设计特征校准模块，对参考图像的全局特征和局部特征进行变换以与背景特征对齐；将校准后的参考特征与原始参考特征结合，供生成网络使用以生成合成图像。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

Conclusion: LiteAttention 在保留动态方法适应性的同时避免了重复开销，通过时间一致性传播跳过决定，大幅减少注意力计算，实验在生产视频扩散模型上展示了显著加速且质量无损失。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Method: Systematic literature review and synthesis of 50+ papers and 20+ datasets, creation of benchmark tables, critical analysis of methods (SSL, semi-supervised, domain generalization, federated, neuro-symbolic), evaluation protocols, and discussion of reproducibility and clinical translation.

Result: Systematic synthesis of 50+ studies and 20+ datasets; critical review of methods (self-/semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated learning, neuro-symbolic models), evaluation/reporting issues, benchmark tables, and practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, clinically deployable DR AI.

Conclusion: Despite major algorithmic advances, gaps remain in multi-center validation, standardized evaluation/reporting, dataset bias handling, and clinical trust.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

Conclusion: S2D-Align通过多阶段、不同粒度的辅助信号显著提升了基于MLLM的放射学报告生成的解剖学对齐能力与生成质量，在公开基准上取得领先表现。

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成模型在多种数据模态（含3D）被广泛采用，但对任务适配缺乏共识；部分3D条件（如不完全点云/深度图）作为条件输入未被充分评估，因此需要比较不同生成模型在3D生成与补全任务上的表现。

Method: 将DDPM（连续潜空间）和自回归因果Transformer适配用于生成形状建模与补全，并进行定量评估、与判别基线对比及广泛消融研究。

Result: 实验证明：1）使用连续潜空间的扩散模型在现实条件下对从单视噪声深度图进行多模态形状补全表现最好；2）在统一的离散潜空间下，自回归模型能与或超过扩散模型；并提供了完整的消融与基线对比数据支持。

Conclusion: 扩散模型（continuous latents）在多模态从单个噪声深度图的形状补全任务上优于判别模型和自回归模型，达到最先进水平；但在相同离散潜空间上，自回归模型可以匹配或超过扩散模型表现。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks. The dataset and code are available at https://dualtransparency.github.io/Phys-Liquid/.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Use DRRs projected from CT as scalable labeled surrogates for chest X-rays to train CAC detection models; lightweight from-scratch CNNs + super-resolution + contrast enhancement + curriculum learning give best AUC 0.754, supporting DRRs as a strong foundation for future transfer to real CXRs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT-based Agatston scoring is gold-standard but impractical for large-scale screening; real CXRs are cheap but lack reliable labels. DRRs can combine CXR-like appearance with precise CT-derived labels, enabling scalable supervised learning for CAC detection.

Method: Generate synthetic DRRs from 667 COCA CT scans; train and evaluate lightweight vs. large pretrained CNNs; apply image super-resolution and contrast enhancement; use curriculum learning for weak supervision; measure AUC performance for CAC detection.

Result: The paper evaluates use of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CT volumes as surrogate training images for coronary artery calcification (CAC) detection, generating DRRs from 667 COCA CT scans and exploring model architectures, preprocessing, super-resolution, and curriculum learning. They find lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; combining super-resolution and contrast enhancement improves performance; and curriculum learning stabilizes weakly supervised training. Their best setup achieves mean AUC 0.754, comparable to prior CXR-based work, suggesting DRRs are promising for scalable, label-rich CAC detection and for future domain adaptation to real chest X-rays.

Conclusion: DRRs can serve as an effective, scalable surrogate domain for training CAC detection models with reliable labels from CT, achieving performance comparable to prior CXR studies and enabling future transfer learning to real chest X-rays.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detect bark beetle infestations with limited labeled samples by leveraging PRISMA hyperspectral data and contrastive learning to learn robust representations.

Method: Contrastive pretraining + SVR few-shot

Result: Pre-trained 1D-CNN encoder + per-class SVR trained on few labels produces better estimates of healthy/attacked/dead tree proportions per pixel, outperforming raw PRISMA bands and Sentinel-2 in Dolomites study.

Conclusion: Combining PRISMA hyperspectral imagery with contrastive few-shot learning yields superior forest health monitoring, enabling accurate per-pixel proportion estimates with few labeled samples.

Abstract: Bark beetle infestations represent a serious challenge for maintaining the health of coniferous forests. This paper proposes a few-shot learning approach leveraging contrastive learning to detect bark beetle infestations using satellite PRISMA hyperspectral data. The methodology is based on a contrastive learning framework to pre-train a one-dimensional CNN encoder, enabling the extraction of robust feature representations from hyperspectral data. These extracted features are subsequently utilized as input to support vector regression estimators, one for each class, trained on few labeled samples to estimate the proportions of healthy, attacked by bark beetle, and dead trees for each pixel. Experiments on the area of study in the Dolomites show that our method outperforms the use of original PRISMA spectral bands and of Sentinel-2 data. The results indicate that PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot learning offers significant advantages for forest health monitoring.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: This paper aims to enable generation of scalable vectorized Chinese glyphs by leveraging LLM token-sequence prediction abilities through stroke modeling, addressing needs in design, animation, and typography for flexible, high-quality glyph creation.

Method: Encode strokes into discrete latent stroke embeddings; fine-tune DeepSeek LLM to predict next stroke embedding; generate full characters or sequences from limited input; evaluate scaling with dataset sizes; validate outputs with expert review.

Result: Proposed LVGM that predicts next-stroke embeddings by fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM; released a 907,267-sample Chinese SVG stroke dataset; shown scaling behavior with data and validated outputs with experts.

Conclusion: LVGM successfully generates vectorized Chinese glyphs via next-stroke prediction, benefits from larger data, and produces outputs validated by experts; the released dataset supports further research.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HinD（含KEPO）从冻结7B MLLM回溯提取推理与知识，自蒸馏并优化知识偏好，生成CoT与事实用于答案预测，显著提升KBVQA表现且无需外部知识源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBVQA方法无论是隐式利用MLLM或显式检索增强，都缺乏可解释的、多步的显式推理轨迹，作者希望通过引导并蒸馏MLLM的内部知识推理来提供显式且有用的推理链与知识片段，改善KBVQA的可解释性与准确性。

Method: 首先用冻结的7B MLLM在已知问题与真实答案的条件下生成中间推理步骤（Hindsight-Zero），构建训练数据；自蒸馏该数据训练Chain-of-Thought生成器和Knowledge生成器以分别产出序列化推理与离散事实；再通过Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization（KEPO）优化知识生成器，使其偏好那些置信度偏低但有帮助的知识而非置信度偏高但无益的知识；最后用生成的CoT与采样知识进行答案预测。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA两个数据集上的实验表明，HinD框架在不依赖外部知识或商业模型API的情况下，基于7B MLLM生成的推理与知识可提升回答质量，达到了优于对比方法的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的HinD框架有效挖掘并利用多模态大模型（7B）内部的知识推理能力，通过回溯蒸馏和偏好优化提升KBVQA性能，在无需商用API或外部知识的条件下于OK-VQA和A-OKVQA上取得优越结果。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

TL;DR: OT-ALD uses optimal transport to map source latents to target latents, removing mismatch, speeding up sampling, and improving FID over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIB links two diffusion models for I2I but suffers from low efficiency and trajectory deviations due to latent mismatches.

Method: Compute optimal transport map from source latent distribution to target latent distribution and use mapped distribution as start for reverse diffusion; retain cycle consistency.

Result: 20.29% improved sampling efficiency and average FID reduced by 2.6 across four tasks on three datasets.

Conclusion: OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatch and improves both efficiency and quality in DDIB-based I2I translation.

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

Motivation: 现有轨迹预测模型通常忽略智能体对轨迹改变事件的时间延迟差异，而这些延迟（注意、处理、反应等）会破坏因果连续性并导致不真实的预测。引入显式延迟建模可提高预测的合理性与可控性。

Method: 引入可学习的混响变换，利用两种显式且可学习的混响核（分别建模注意/处理与反应延迟或不同时间尺度的延迟行为），将历史事件通过卷积样式的混响应用到未来预测，进而预测每个智能体的延迟分布并基于此生成可控的轨迹预测；训练时同时优化核参数与预测模块以适应数据的延迟异质性与随机性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Rev模型能有效模拟并预测智能体的延迟偏好与随机性，实现可控轨迹预测；在多个数据集上性能有竞争力，且提供了可解释的延迟动力学分析，显示其作为通用延迟建模方法的潜力。

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explainable anomaly detection can't specify anomaly types and require per-category models or heavy VLMs; need lightweight single-model multi-type explainability suitable for constrained systems.

Method: Convolutional multi-channel explanation for anomaly type separation

Result: MultiTypeFCDD produces multi-channel heatmaps each channel tied to an anomaly type using only image-level labels; competitive performance on Real-IAD with much lower parameters and inference time.

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD是实用且高效的多类型异常检测可解释方案，减少模型数量和计算开销，适合实时/嵌入式应用。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

TL;DR: 提出AlignVQA：多专家VLM辩论框架+aligncal微分校准损失，通过专家生成候选答案、通用体评议聚合，显著改善VQA系统置信度校准并降低过度自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQA systems in high-stakes settings need reliable confidence estimates; existing VLMs are accurate but often overconfident; calibration under-explored especially for agentic multi-agent setups.

Method: 构建多个采用不同提示策略的专门化VLM生成候选答案；引入两阶段交互：通用体(agent)批评、精炼并聚合提案以产生最终答案与置信度；设计可微分的aligncal损失，最小化校准误差上界对专门化代理进行微调；在多个VQA数据集上进行实验评估校准改进。

Result: AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework with specialized VLMs and generalist agents for critique/refinement, produces better calibrated confidence estimates; introduce differentiable calibration-aware loss aligncal to fine-tune agents, empirically reduces calibration error across VQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Debate-based multi-agent interaction与aligncal联合可显著提升VQA系统的置信度校准性，且更校准的专家带来更好的整体对齐置信度，适用于高风险视觉决策场景。

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可插拔的粗到细时间对齐模块，用于在4D Gaussian Splatting重建中估计并补偿摄像机的时间偏移，从而在不同步的多视角视频上显著提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view dynamic scene reconstruction methods (e.g., 4D Gaussian Splatting) assume synchronized input streams; real-world captures often have temporal misalignment due to camera trigger delays or independent recording, degrading reconstruction quality.

Method: 设计一个两阶段对齐流程：先估计粗略的帧级时间偏移，然后利用插值或光度/特征匹配在亚帧精度上细化偏移；将时间补偿作为可插拔模块融入4DGS训练和渲染流程，实验验证对不同步视频的改进效果。

Result: A coarse-to-fine temporal alignment module that estimates per-camera time shifts (coarse frame-level offsets and sub-frame refinements) integrated into 4DGS pipelines, improving reconstruction quality on unsynchronized multi-view videos.

Conclusion: 通过帧级到亚帧级的逐步对齐策略，可以有效恢复摄像机之间的时间一致性，显著增强4DGS在非同步数据下的鲁棒性，并且模块可无缝集成到现有框架中。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1在保持线性时间复杂度的同时，显著提高了对任务相关视觉区域的关注与细粒度推理性能，适合资源受限部署场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Motivation: 在仅使用单个红外通道和有限观测（4帧、1小时）条件下，探索能有效捕捉时空模式的轻量神经网络（ConvGRU）与迁移学习策略，以实现短期（≤4h）降水预报并满足Weather4Cast竞赛评估指标。

Method: 输入为4帧、间隔一小时内的SEVIRI 10.8μm亮温，使用ConvGRU进行时空序列预测至4小时后；两阶段训练：第一阶段训练ConvGRU预测未来亮温；第二阶段用经验导出的非线性变换把预测亮温映射为与OPERA兼容的降水率。事件任务在降水场基础上采用3D事件检测与时空特征提取进行识别与表征。

Result: 在累积降水任务中取得第2名；在事件预测任务中直接使用同一模型得到与竞赛基线相近的分数，表明方法在定量降水估计上有效，但在事件识别上改进有限。

Conclusion: 方法在累计降水评分上表现优异（第2名），说明单通道亮温加ConvGRU并通过经验映射可获得有竞争力的短时降水预报，但事件检测任务未显著优于基线，表明事件判别或特征提取环节仍有改进空间。

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Motivation: Enable interpretable, robust geospatial reasoning on satellite imagery for climate applications by combining chain-of-thought supervision with preference optimization to produce better rationales and decisions

Method: Chain-of-thought VQA with preference fine-tuning

Result: CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9% over direct baselines; DPO provides additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality; overall system enables richer geospatial reasoning for multispectral Earth observation

Conclusion: Combining CoT supervision with DPO yields substantial improvements in accuracy and reasoning quality for geospatial VQA, making the system more suitable for high-stakes climate decision support

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在根本性脆弱性，需要将评估扩展到非对抗性、应保持不变的扰动，并利用稳定性检测提升可靠性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Motivation: Address data scarcity in medical imaging by enabling a single foundation model to expand to multiple domains, tasks, modalities without retraining full models

Conclusion: 基础模型可通过模块化组件扩展其能力，支持多任务多模态的医疗影像应用，而无需为每个任务或模态单独预训练模型。

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

TL;DR: Use Video Diffusion Models to provide multi-view consistency priors for 3D Gaussian Splatting by supervising rendered neighboring views via a unified guidance combining depth-warp and semantic-feature corrections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS overfits with sparse views due to lack of intermediate-view supervision; VDMs contain rich multi-view consistency priors that can be distilled to improve generalization and geometry.

Method: Render multiple neighboring views from 3D Gaussian splats, compute VDM noise-prediction guidance, then correct it using depth-warp guidance (from real depth maps) and semantic image-feature guidance before applying score-distillation updates to the splat parameters.

Result: Paper proposes Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to regularize 3D Gaussian Splatting using pretrained Video Diffusion Models (VDM) for sparse-view scenarios.

Conclusion: GSD improves multi-view consistency and geometry under sparse views, outperforming prior methods by aligning VDM score updates with correct camera poses and depth-informed geometry.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

TL;DR: We study and quantify positional bias in multimodal representation models for image-text retrieval, finding modality-specific bias patterns and identifying contributing factors


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Positional bias harms performance; prior work focused on text generation not representation models, and multimodal settings underexplored

Method: Empirical study of positional bias in multimodal representation models

Result: Positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models; text encoders bias toward input beginning, image encoders bias at both beginning and end; bias influenced by positional encoding, training loss, context importance, and image-text pair usage

Conclusion: Positional bias exists in multimodal representation models, differs across modalities, and is caused or amplified by multiple design/training factors; awareness can guide mitigation and evaluation practices

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

*Zhongbin Guo,Jiahe Liu,Yushan Li,Wenyu Gao,Zhen Yang,Chenzhi Li,Xinyue Zhang,Ping Jian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GEODE框架，通过解耦输入（专用空间推理模块DRM）与输出（连续回归头DRH）来增强VLM的3D空间理解与数值回归能力，1.5B模型能达到或超越7B+模型的空间推理表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLM受限于“二维”感知与离散token输出，难以处理精确连续数值和复杂3D空间推理。作者希望通过结构性解耦输入与输出，利用专用模块弥补主模型短板，提升小模型在空间任务上的表现。

Method: 在主VLM外接两个可插拔模块：1) Decoupled Rationale Module（DRM）用交叉注意力将显式3D数据（深度/点云/相机参数）与2D视觉特征对齐，并蒸馏空间链式思考（CoT）逻辑为可注入的Rationale Tokens；2) Direct Regression Head（DRH）采用“Embedding-as-Value”范式，将专用控制token送入轻量MLP以回归连续标量与3D边界框。整个系统保持主模型为语义调度器，参数量仅1.5B。

Result: 在若干空间推理任务（如3D边界框回归、距离/角度回归、空间关系推理）中，1.5B的GEODE模型表现达到或接近平衡7B+基线，并在数值回归精度与推理一致性上显著提升。

Conclusion: GEODE通过DRM与DRH两模块补充主VLM，成功突破输入的几何信息获取瓶颈与输出的离散化数值限制，使小型模型实现高精度连续数值和3D边界框回归，从而在空间推理任务上取得SOTA级别性能。

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

*Jitesh Chavan,Rohit Lal,Anand Kamat,Mengjia Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arcee通过跨块传递终态SSR实现轻量的跨块记忆连接，兼容现有方法，显著降低图像生成FID（82.81→15.33）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mamba在处理非序列信号时，为放松严格因果性采用多种扫描顺序，但每块选择性扫描操作都会将状态重置为零，导致跨块记忆丢失，限制了长程和跨块信息传递。

Method: 提出跨块递归状态链（Arcee），将每块的终态SSR作为下一块的初始条件；通过可微分的边界映射（含Jacobian）实现端到端梯度流；设计与现有"vision-mamba"变体兼容的实现并提供高效CUDA内核与训练代码。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ 256×256无条件生成任务（Flow Matching）上，单次Zigzag扫描的Mamba基线FID由82.81降至15.33（约5.4×提升），并声称兼容所有先前视觉Mamba变体、无参数且开销可忽略。

Conclusion: Arcee通过跨块复用终态SSR作为下一区块初始态，显著改善了基于Mamba的视觉SSM在非序列信号（如图像）上的建模与生成质量，同时兼容现有方法、无额外参数且开销极小。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), Mamba in particular, are increasingly adopted for long-context sequence modeling, providing linear-time aggregation via an input-dependent, causal selective-scan operation. Along this line, recent "Mamba-for-vision" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior "vision-mamba" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline. Efficient CUDA kernels and training code will be released to support rigorous and reproducible research.

Conclusion: SACF框架在AGT数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，显著提升了面部注视的检测效果，证明利用场景社会上下文与专家模型能有效应对自闭症目光数据的类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

TL;DR: 作者发现扩散模型隐含地感知计数准确性，提出无需训练的CountSteer，通过在推理阶段操控cross-attention隐藏态来提高指定对象计数，实验显示计数准确率提升约4%且图像质量不受影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型常生成逼真图像但难以精确遵循文本中关于对象数量的指令，作者发现模型内部信号与计数正确性相关，因而可借此纠正生成偏差。

Method: 提出CountSteer：一种训练免费的方法，在推理时操作模型的cross-attention隐藏态以引导生成满足文本中指定数量的对象。

Result: 在实验中，CountSteer在不损害视觉质量的情况下将对象计数准确率提升约4%。

Conclusion: CountSteer表明扩散模型内部确实编码了与数目一致性相关的潜在信号，通过推理阶段引导cross-attention隐藏态可以无训练改进计数准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统将图像patch与单个token对齐的方法缺乏语义对应性；人类可理解的语义应为token组（短语）与图像对象对应，因而需要在模型内部学习token分组以获得更细粒度的视觉-语言知识。

Method: 在模型架构中引入token分组机制，将分组后的语言表征与专门训练以发现物体的图像编码器输出对齐。训练目标促使语言组对应图像中的对象。

Result: Proposes grouping caption tokens within model architecture to capture fine-grained language representations aligned to object-discovering image encoder outputs

Conclusion: 通过在模型中学习token分组并与物体发现图像编码器对齐，能显著增强视觉-语言模型的细粒度理解，且自动发现的token组与文本中的groundable短语高度相符。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Fabian Schmidt,Markus Enzweiler,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Using serialized traffic scene graphs as prompts to vision-language driving models significantly improves performance (up to ~17%), and models can internalize relational priors during training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address lack of explicit relational supervision in vision-language driving models by conditioning them on structured traffic scene graphs to improve topology-aware reasoning.

Method: Serialize scene graphs at multiple abstraction levels and formats, incorporate via structured prompt templates, fine-tune vision-language driving models (e.g., LMDrive, BEVDriver) on LangAuto benchmark, evaluate performance gains; models need not use graphs at test-time.

Result: Scene graph conditioning consistently improves driving performance across models, with up to 15.6% increase for LMDrive and 17.5% for BEVDriver; improvements persist even without scene graphs at test-time.

Conclusion: Scene graph-conditioned training helps models better internalize relational priors and yields large, persistent driving performance gains; resources are released publicly.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

TL;DR: 提出Φeat，通过对比同一材料在不同形状与光照下的空间裁剪和物理增强，进行无监督预训练，学习对材质敏感且对几何/光照等外界因素不变的表征，适合物理感知任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督视觉特征将高层语义与低层物理因素纠缠，限制在需要显式物理推理任务（如材质估计、内禀分解）中的应用，因而需要一种对材质敏感且对外界物理变化不变的表示。

Method: 构建包含同一材料在多形状和多光照下的图像数据；采用对比学习，正样本为不同空间裁剪和物理增强的同材料图像，负样本为其他材料；训练目标使表示对材料一致、对几何/照明不变。

Result: Paper proposes Φeat, a self-supervised physically-grounded visual backbone focusing on material identity (reflectance, mesostructure). Uses pretraining contrasting spatial crops and physical augmentations under varying shapes/lighting. Claims no labels needed and yields features invariant to external physical factors, better for tasks needing physical reasoning. Evaluations: feature similarity and material selection show captures physical structure beyond semantics.

Conclusion: 无监督对比预训练能学到物理基础性特征，Φeat在捕捉材质与微观结构方面优于仅语义驱动的特征，能作为物理感知的视觉骨干。

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORAL learns inter-slice continuous ordinal and relational structure via contrastive ranking and ordinal alignment to improve volumetric segmentation with few labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing slice-contrastive methods use hard binary thresholds and ignore global directional consistency, losing continuous anatomical similarity and canonical progression.

Method: Contrastive ranking + ordinal constraint

Result: State-of-the-art segmentation under limited annotations and anatomically meaningful representations

Conclusion: Coordinative learning of local continuous similarity and global directional consistency yields better representations and segmentation performance in limited-annotation volumetric medical imaging.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure. Code is available at https://github.com/haoyiwang25/CORAL.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需数据集先验的梯度引导频域与像素域联合增强方法（D-GAP），通过任务梯度构建频率灵敏度图并在振幅上自适应插值，辅以像素混合，显著提升OOD鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用增强在域外鲁棒性上提升不稳定，数据集特定增强需专家知识，且网络对域特定频率存在学习偏差，纯频域扰动忽略像素细节导致性能受限。

Method: 基于任务梯度在频率空间计算灵敏度图（sensitivity maps），用以自适应地在源样本与目标样本的振幅之间插值，从而扰动模型过度依赖的频率成分；随后在像素空间进行互补的混合以恢复精细空间细节。

Result: 在四个真实世界数据集和三个域适应基准上，D-GAP均优于通用与数据集特定增强：在真实世界数据集平均提高+5.3%，在基准数据集提高+1.8%。

Conclusion: D-GAP通过在频率（振幅）空间和像素空间中进行数据增强，显著提升了模型在域外（OOD）场景下的鲁棒性，有效减少了网络对域特定频率成分的学习偏差。

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Gaze redirection methods aim to generate realistic human face images with controllable eye movement. However, recent methods often struggle with 3D consistency, efficiency, or quality, limiting their practical applications. In this work, we propose RTGaze, a real-time and high-quality gaze redirection method. Our approach learns a gaze-controllable facial representation from face images and gaze prompts, then decodes this representation via neural rendering for gaze redirection. Additionally, we distill face geometric priors from a pretrained 3D portrait generator to enhance generation quality. We evaluate RTGaze both qualitatively and quantitatively, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in efficiency, redirection accuracy, and image quality across multiple datasets. Our system achieves real-time, 3D-aware gaze redirection with a feedforward network (~0.06 sec/image), making it 800x faster than the previous state-of-the-art 3D-aware methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hand-crafted noise simulation limits generalization; low-frequency components are inherently stable and can bind robust watermark

Method: Embedding watermark into low-frequency deep features via VAE without noise simulation

Result: Proposed SimuFreeMark embeds watermark in low-frequency deep feature space using pretrained VAE, eliminating noise simulation; outperforms SOTA on conventional and semantic attacks with better visual quality

Conclusion: Embedding watermarks into VAE-bound low-frequency feature representations provides strong, generalizable robustness against diverse attacks and maintains high visual quality

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人工采摘成本高、季节性劳动力短缺等问题，提升果实自动化采摘的可行性与效率。

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices. Code is available in the supplementary material.

TL;DR: 发布YCB-Ev SD：5万段34ms的SD分辨率合成事件数据，按BOP生成并评估事件表示，结论是线性衰减+双极性time-surface最优，数据和表示公开以便复现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前事件相机领域缺乏与帧式视觉相当规模且标准化的合成数据集，限制了基于CNN的位姿估计方法的发展与公平比较。

Method: 基于PBR渲染YCB-Video物体场景，按BOP规范生成5万段每段34ms的事件序列；采用模拟线性相机运动以覆盖场景和背景扰动。系统地对多种事件表示（时间表面time-surface）进行对比，测试线性衰减与指数衰减、单通道与双极性编码的效果；并为每个样本提供原始事件流与预计算的最优表示。

Result: 提供50,000段事件序列（34ms/段），验证表明：线性衰减的time-surface与双通道极性编码在CNN位姿估计上优于指数衰减与单通道，极性信息贡献最大，线性时间编码更好保留运动信息。数据集已在Hugging Face公开。

Conclusion: 本论文构建并公开了YCB-Ev SD合成事件相机数据集，填补了事件视觉在6DoF物体位姿估计上缺乏大规模标准分辨率合成数据的空白，且提供了便于复现的表示与基线评估。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.
  The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/paroj/ycbev_sd.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D动作生成模型依赖精确3D监督导致过拟合坐标模式，泛化性差；放宽3D监督可能促使模型学习核心3D结构和运动语义，从而提升泛化与数据效率。

Method: 提出Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE(ML-RQ)将2D动作序列映射到3D一致性的潜在空间，并设计一套免3D正则项（视角一致性、方向连贯性、物理合理性）进行训练；整个系统仅使用2D动作数据。

Result: Free3D在仅用2D数据训练下生成的3D动作在多样性、时间连贯性和语义对齐上表现良好，性能可比甚至超越全3D监督方法，验证了免3D监督的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出Free3D框架，通过免3D注释的训练策略生成真实感3D动作，表明在弱监督下模型能学到更强的结构推理并提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAC模型缺乏层次化结构来解耦长期情感基与短期波动，导致模型不稳定和表征退化；不同情感波动在不同情境下含义不同，需要分层建模。

Method: 提出基于低秩稀疏原理的统一框架LSEF，包含三个可插拔模块：稳定编码模块（SEM）提取低秩情感基；动态解耦模块（DDM）分离稀疏瞬时信号；一致性融合模块（CIM）重建多尺度稳定性与反应性一致性，并通过秩感知优化（RAO）平衡梯度平滑性与敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了LSEF能够显著提升鲁棒性和动态辨识能力，证明层次化低秩稀疏建模在理解情感动态上的有效性与通用性。

Conclusion: LSEF通过分解情感动态为低秩的长期基和稀疏的短期波动，实现了更稳定且具有辨识力的情感表示，实验表明其在鲁棒性和动态区分上显著提升。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

*Manyu Li,Ruian He,Chenxi Ma,Weimin Tan,Bo Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MicroVQA++ provides a large, quality-controlled microscopy VQA dataset using literature-derived pairs, a novel HiCQA-Graph for multimodal consistency filtering, and MLLM+human-in-the-loop MCQ generation, improving MLLM performance on microscopy reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microscopy VQA requires large-scale, high-quality supervised data but such data are scarce; need improved dataset and filtering for cross-modal consistency to train MLLMs for biomedical imaging tasks.

Method: Three-stage pipeline: 1) bootstrap from expert-validated figure-caption pairs from BIOMEDICA; 2) apply HiCQA-Graph (heterogeneous graph integrating NLI textual entailment, CLIP vision-language alignment, and agent signals) to filter inconsistent samples; 3) use MLLM agents to generate MCQs, followed by human screening to produce final dataset splits.

Result: Created MicroVQA++: a three-stage corpus from BIOMEDICA with expert-validated figure-caption pairs, HiCQA-Graph for filtering inconsistent samples, and MLLM-generated MCQs with human screening; dataset enables 4B-scale MLLMs to achieve strong microscopy reasoning and SOTA among open-source MLLMs.

Conclusion: Careful data construction—expert literature sourcing, graph-based cross-modal filtering, and human refinement—produces a high-quality microscopy VQA dataset that boosts MLLM performance, enabling competitive and SOTA outcomes for 4B-scale models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Motivation: Explore and benchmark MLLMs' capabilities in assessing document image quality, since prior work focused on high-level vision tasks and DIQA remained underexplored.

Method: Three-tiered DIQA evaluation for MLLMs

Result: Q-Doc framework with coarse (quality scoring), middle (distortion-type identification), and fine (distortion-severity assessment) levels; CoT prompting improves performance; MLLMs have nascent DIQA abilities but show inconsistencies and misjudgments.

Conclusion: MLLMs show early-stage DIQA capabilities but suffer from inconsistent scoring, misidentification, and severity misjudgment; CoT prompting helps; benchmark and code released.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

Motivation: 利用CLIP强大的多模态表示能力解决类增量学习中的遗忘与效率问题，同时避免额外可学习模块带来的复杂性和易遗忘性，并充分整合视觉与文本模态优势。

Method: 将所有适配限制在CLIP的cross-modal bridge-layer，提出Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion（正交低秩融合）构造与历史任务特征正交的低秩‘安全子空间’以约束参数更新，并构建跨模态混合原型结合稳定的文本原型与由桥接层得到的视觉原型。

Result: 在标准基准上，BOFA在准确性和效率上均优于现有方法，实现无数据重放下的稳定知识积累与更高分类性能。

Conclusion: BOFA通过在CLIP的桥接层内进行适配并使用正交低秩融合防止遗忘，实现了在不增加参数与推理开销的情况下有效的类增量学习。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG and vision modalities are asymmetric: EEG has low fidelity and shallow semantics while vision has high-fidelity rich semantics. Forcing symmetric alignment harms generalization.

Method: Adaptive teaching with ShrinkAdapter

Result: Proposed adaptive teaching paradigm and ShrinkAdapter module; achieved 60.2% top-1 accuracy on zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval, +9.8% over prior SOTA.

Conclusion: 引入不对称对齐新视角，教师需收缩并适配以弥合视觉-脑信号差距，证明有效性并取得SOTA结果。

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) requires models to localize objects in images based on natural language descriptions. Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems.

Motivation: 现有数据集多为单轮交互，不能反映现实世界中图像创作与编辑的多轮上下文依赖性，因此需要一个专门针对多轮交替跨模态理解与生成的基准套件。

Method: 构建两部分：WEAVE-100k（大规模自动/半自动构造的 100K 多轮交替样本，涵盖理解、编辑、生成，带历史上下文）和 WEAVEBench（人类注释的 100 个任务，480 张图片，采用混合 VLM judger 评估，结合参考图与原图+编辑指令评估生成质量）。同时，在模型上训练并在 WEAVEBench 上评估，分析视觉记忆和多轮生成能力。

Result: 在 WEAVE-100k 上训练能提升模型在视觉理解、图像编辑和协同生成方面的能力，并促成模型出现一定的视觉记忆 emergent 能力；但在 WEAVEBench 的详细评测下，当前方法在多轮、上下文感知的图像生成与编辑任务上仍存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

### [100] [The Persistence of Cultural Memory: Investigating Multimodal Iconicity in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11435)
*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出“多模态标志性”（multimodal iconicity），把识别（是否认出参考）和实现（如何描绘，复制或重释）分开评估，构建量化指标并在5个扩散模型与767个文化参考上验证，发现模型常在文本被扰动时仍复制标志性视觉结构；文化一致性受训练频率、文本独特性、流行度和创作年代影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对记忆与泛化的讨论侧重忘却或复制，缺乏对模型如何识别并以何种方式再现文化参照的区分；需要更细致的评估框架来理解模型在文化知识上的保留与变换。

Method: 构建包含767个来自Wikidata的文化参考（静态与动态影像），设计识别与实现两类量化指标，比较现有相似度方法；在5个扩散模型上进行生成与提示扰动（同义词替换、字面图像描述），并统计与训练数据频率、文本唯一性、参考流行度及创作年代的关系。

Result: Paper introduces concept 'multimodal iconicity' distinguishing recognition vs realization in text-to-image diffusion models; provides evaluation framework and metrics; evaluates 5 diffusion models on 767 Wikidata-derived references; shows framework outperforms similarity methods; finds models reproduce iconic visual structures despite prompt perturbations; cultural alignment correlates with training frequency, textual uniqueness, popularity, creation date.

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值既在于复制文化内容也在于如何变换与再语境化；需要超越简单的文本-图像相似度评估，采用识别与实现双维度、更具语境信息的评价。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

### [101] [Hi-DREAM: Brain Inspired Hierarchical Diffusion for fMRI Reconstruction via ROI Encoder and visuAl Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11437)
*Guowei Zhang,Yun Zhao,Moein Khajehnejad,Adeel Razi,Levin Kuhlmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce Hi-DREAM: hierarchical, ROI-based conditioning for diffusion decoders that aligns cortical hierarchy with U-Net scales, improving semantic reconstruction and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping fMRI to images currently conditions directly on fMRI without considering cortical hierarchical organization, which may blur roles of different visual areas.

Method: ROI adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams, builds multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned to U-Net scales; lightweight depth-matched ControlNet injects scale-specific hints during denoising.

Result: Hi-DREAM groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams, converts them into multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with U-Net depth, and uses depth-matched ControlNet during denoising, achieving SOTA on semantic metrics on NSD while keeping low-level fidelity.

Conclusion: Structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy yields efficient, interpretable decoders that reveal functional contributions of visual areas and outperform purely data-driven embeddings on high-level metrics.

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 VP-Bench：两阶段基准（感知与下游任务），用30k视觉提示与355属性组合评估28个 MLLM，分析影响因素如提示属性、问题顺序与模型规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统化基准评估 MLLM 对人类常用的视觉提示（如 bounding box）的理解，导致无法确认模型在地面化指称与基于局部区域的问答任务上的能力与可靠性。

Method: 两阶段评估：Stage 1 在自然场景中用8种形状与30k可视化提示测试模型感知能力（355个属性组合）。Stage 2 在实际问题中注入视觉提示，评估其对下游任务理解与解决方案的影响。对28个模型进行横向比较并分析影响因素。

Result: VP-Bench 提出并评估了多模态大模型对“视觉提示”（bounding boxes等）的理解与利用能力。

Conclusion: 许多现有 MLLM 在解释与利用视觉提示方面存在差异性能力；VP 属性、排列与模型规模都会显著影响表现。VP-Bench 为研究 MLLM 地面化指称问题提供标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

*Massimo Rizzoli,Simone Alghisi,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Controlled, annotated synthetic data for fine-tuning reduces biases and boosts real-world absolute position performance


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address biases, annotation errors, and distribution imbalance in real-world fine-tuning by generating controlled synthetic data

Method: Fine-tuning VLMs with controlled synthetic data

Result: Balanced synthetic fine-tuning yields uniform scene performance and improved transfer to real-world (COCO), outperforming matched-setting fine-tuning

Conclusion: Controlled synthetic datasets that comprehensively sample object attributes improve VLM robustness and transferability compared to standard real-world fine-tuning

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

### [105] [Rethinking Efficient Mixture-of-Experts for Remote Sensing Modality-Missing Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11460)
*Qinghao Gao,Jianhai Qu,Yunsong Li,Weiqiang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMOL通过双路由的Mixture-of-Loras结构将模态缺失视为多任务问题，实现轻量级、参数高效的适配，显著提高遥感多模态分类在缺失情况的鲁棒性，并具备跨域迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感多模态分类常因环境干扰、传感器故障或大气因素导致模态丢失，现有两阶段自适应方法既计算代价高又通常要求训练时模态完整，难以泛化到实际不完整场景，因此需要一种高效、通用且稳健的方法处理模态缺失。

Method: 引入双路由机制：1）任务导向动态路由器按缺失模式自适应激活轻量化专家（LoRA风格）；2）模态特定-共享静态路由器维持跨模态知识共享。整体通过共享专家与参数高效的LoRA式更新避免对每种缺失模式训练独立网络。

Result: 提出了一种用于处理遥感多模态数据缺失问题的新框架MaMOL（Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras）。该方法将模态缺失重构为多任务学习问题，通过双路由机制（任务导向的动态路由器和模态共享的静态路由器）在不同缺失模式下自适应激活专家模块，同时保持跨模态知识共享。与传统为每种缺失配置训练独立网络的方法不同，MaMOL通过轻量级专家更新和共享专家复用实现参数高效适配。实验证明在多项遥感基准上，在不同缺失率下表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力，计算开销最小；在自然图像上的迁移实验也验证了其可扩展性和跨域适用性。

Conclusion: MaMOL有效解决了多模态输入不完整时的适配问题，兼顾性能与计算效率，能够在遥感与自然图像等域中推广应用。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

### [106] [Benchmarking Visual LLMs Resilience to Unanswerable Questions on Visually Rich Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11468)
*Davide Napolitano,Luca Cagliero,Fabrizio Battiloro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VRD-UQA基准，自动生成并验证在多页视觉丰富文档中‘看似合理但不可回答’的问题，评估12个VLLM在不同腐败类型和知识注入策略下的检测能力，发现现有模型在识别此类问题上存在显著不足，提示需要更好的方法来提高文档VQA系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是当前VLLMs在多页视觉丰富文档的VQA表现优异，但对‘不可回答’问题的鲁棒性未知；现实应用（如表单、发票、多页合同）中经常出现看似合理但因细微信息差异而不可回答的问题，误答可能带来严重后果，因此需要评估并提升VLLMs识别此类问题的能力

Method: 提出VRD-UQA基准：自动从多页VRD的现有VQA数据集中生成‘看似合理但不可回答’的问题，通过替换同类型实体（不同文档元素或不同页位置）来制造细微腐败；采用VLLM-as-a-judge的方式验证问题确为不可回答；对12个VLLM进行系统评估，考察页级和文档级不可答检测、不同腐败类型的影响，以及多种知识注入的提示策略（OCR提供、选取相关页、在示例或提示中加入不可答可能性说明）

Result: 实验结果表明：1) VLLMs在页级和文档级检测不可回答问题的准确率普遍不足，尤其在跨页或布局相关的腐败上表现较差；2) NLP实体替换导致的腐败更容易被误判为可回答，而布局或文档元素替换更具迷惑性；3) 引入OCR文本、多页选择策略以及在示例/提示中声明不可回答可能性能提升检测效果，但提升有限且依赖模型规模和对视觉信息的利用能力

Conclusion: 论文结论是：当前VLLMs在识别对多页视觉丰富文档中看似合理但实质上不可回答的问题方面存在明显局限，且在页级和文档级检测不可回答性准确率较低。不同类型的腐败（NLP实体替换、文档元素替换、布局替换）对VLLMs性能影响不同，基于上下文学习的知识注入策略（OCR、多页选择、提示中明确不可回答可能性）能在一定程度上提高检测能力，但仍不足以完全解决问题。VRD-UQA作为基准能有效评估和促进更鲁棒的文档VQA系统发展。

Abstract: The evolution of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) has revolutionized the automatic understanding of Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), which contain both textual and visual elements. Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sat2RealCity generates realistic, appearance-controllable 3D buildings from satellite images using building-level generation, OSM spatial priors, and MLLM semantic guidance, reducing need for large 3D datasets


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce dependence on large-scale 3D city assets and bridge gap between satellite imagery and realistic 3D urban models

Method: Entity-based Sat-to-3D pipeline with appearance control

Result: Introduces OSM-based spatial priors, appearance-guided controllable modeling, and MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation; outperforms baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism

Conclusion: Sat2RealCity provides a scalable, interpretable, and appearance-aware approach to converting satellite imagery into realistic 3D urban scenes, enabling better real-world alignment and reduced data requirements

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have substantially enhanced 3D urban generation, enabling applications in digital twins, virtual cities, and large-scale simulations. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) the need for large-scale 3D city assets for supervised training, which are difficult and costly to obtain, and (2) reliance on semantic or height maps, which are used exclusively for generating buildings in virtual worlds and lack connection to real-world appearance, limiting the realism and generalizability of generated cities. To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery. Unlike previous city-level generation methods, Sat2RealCity builds generation upon individual building entities, enabling the use of rich priors and pretrained knowledge from 3D object generation while substantially reducing dependence on large-scale 3D city assets. Specifically, (1) we introduce the OSM-based spatial priors strategy to achieve interpretable geometric generation from spatial topology to building instances; (2) we design an appearance-guided controllable modeling mechanism for fine-grained appearance realism and style control; and (3) we construct an MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation pipeline, bridging semantic interpretation and geometric reconstruction. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Sat2RealCity significantly surpasses existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, establishing a strong foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content creation. The code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ImAgent——一个训练-free的统一多模态代理，通过策略控制器在测试时整合多种生成与自评动作，提升图像生成与编辑的质量和语义一致性，同时保持高效的扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I方法在提示模糊或欠定时易出现随机性与与提示不一致的问题；现有解法（提示重写、best-of-N、自我微调）往往需外部模块且独立运行，导致测试时扩展效率和计算开销问题。

Method: 在无额外训练的前提下，设计一个策略控制器(policy controller)，让多个生成动作（如多次采样、自我修正、局部编辑等）动态交互和自组织，内部实现推理与自评流程，从而在测试时高效扩展而无需外部模型。

Result: 广泛的图像生成与编辑实验表明，ImAgent持续优于骨干模型，并在骨干失败的情况下超过其他强基线，证明了统一多模态代理在测试时扩展下的自适应与高效性。

Conclusion: ImAgent是一个训练-free的统一多模态代理，通过在单一框架内集成推理、生成和自我评估，能在测试时扩展中提高图像质量与语义一致性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少 IHC 方法的资源开销，直接从更廉价且常规的 H&E 染色切片推断 PD-L1，从而实现更可扩展、可解释的免疫治疗生物标志物评估。

Method: 基于 nnUNet-v2 的循环训练框架，多次在训练过程的不同检查点采样模型以近似后验分布（MPS），对每个输入生成多次预测并计算像素级熵与标准差作为不确定性指标。

Result: nnUNet-B 提出了一种基于贝叶斯思想的分割框架，通过在循环训练中采样多个模型检查点以近似后验，利用多模态后验采样（MPS）从 H&E 染色图像直接推断 PD-L1 表达，输出像素级不确定性（熵和标准差）并实现竞争性分割性能。

Conclusion: nnUNet-B 在肺鳞癌数据集上能在保持高分割性能的同时提供与错误高度相关的像素级不确定性图，但不确定性校准仍需改进，表明基于 H&E 的不确定性感知 PD-L1 预测对临床流程具有可扩展性和可解释性潜力。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: introduce PAS, a lightweight attention-based signal to detect object hallucinations in LVLMs by measuring reliance on prelim tokens


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: reduce object hallucinations by detecting when model ignores image and relies on prelim tokens

Method: analysis of method

Result: PAS computed from attention over prelim tokens correlates with hallucination and enables detection, real-time filtering

Conclusion: PAS is training-free, efficient, and achieves SOTA hallucination detection enabling real-time intervention

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

Conclusion: OpenUS通过大规模公开数据和自适应掩码预训练策略，提高了超声表征的通用性与标签效率，可作为下游任务的通用骨干，降低数据与标注要求。

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/XZheng0427/OpenUS.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

TL;DR: BRIDGE在编码器顶部加入几层双向跨注意力，将视觉与文本隐藏状态投影到共享空间并相互更新，从而在不牺牲双编码器效率的情况下提升多项视觉-语言任务表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM方法要么在编码器中早期融合，要么在池化后的表示上进行晚期融合，且常和自回归解码器耦合；但视觉与文本的隐藏状态本身携带丰富的模态内部结构（视觉的空间布局、文本的句法语义），直接对齐这些隐藏状态更符合两模态“思考”的匹配方式。

Method: 在两个编码器顶部插入若干仅跨模态的双向注意力层：每层将视觉和文本的隐藏状态投影到共享空间，进行跨模态注意力，并以门控残差将更新回传到各自隐藏状态，辅以简单的稳定化手段；保持编码器为非因果结构，生成任务通过可选解码器解耦。

Result: 在检索、VQA和视觉推理等基准上，BRIDGE在保持对比学习模型双编码器高效性的同时，优于可比的视觉-语言模型。代码开源。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一种轻量级的跨模态融合模块（BRIDGE），通过在图像与文本编码器顶部添加双向跨注意力层来在隐藏状态级别对齐视觉与语言信息，实现了更自然的模态间匹配。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

TL;DR: DocLens像透镜一样“放大”证据，结合多智能体和采样裁决，显著改进长视觉文档的证据定位和问答表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在长视觉文档理解中难以定位证据，既难检索到相关页面，也忽视视觉元素内部的细粒度信息，导致性能受限和模型幻觉。

Method: 框架先从整篇文档导航到相关页面的具体视觉元素（即“zoom in”），然后通过采样-裁决(sampling-adjudication)机制在多个候选答案中选出单一可靠答案；使用工具链与多智能体协作，并与强大基线模型（如Gemini-2.5-Pro）配合。

Result: 在MMLongBench-Doc和FinRAGBench-V上达到SOTA，优于人类专家，尤其在依赖视觉信息的查询和不可回答问题上表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: DocLens通过工具增强的多智能体框架，显著提升了长视觉文档中证据定位能力，从而减少幻觉并提高问答准确率。

Abstract: Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.

Conclusion: LARM 在稀疏视角下实现了可扩展、准确的 3D 关节化对象重建与新视图/状态合成，生成的网格高保真贴合输入图像，优于 SOTA。

Abstract: Modeling 3D articulated objects with realistic geometry, textures, and kinematics is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/

TL;DR: ResBench: automated benchmark to evaluate database resilience under injected adverse events across 8 metrics with visualization


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks ignore adverse events; need to quantify DB resilience comprehensively

Method: Propose ResBench benchmark based on resilience definition

Result: ResBench framework automates simulation/injection of adverse events, collects metrics, evaluates across 8 dimensions, provides GUI visualization

Conclusion: ResBench enables standardized, automated, visual evaluation of database resilience using simulated adversity datasets

Abstract: Existing database benchmarks primarily focus on performance under ideal running environments. However, in real-world scenarios, databases probably face numerous adverse events. Quantifying the ability to cope with these events from a comprehensive perspective remains an open problem. We provide the definition of database resilience to describe its performance when facing adversity and propose ResBench, a benchmark for evaluating database resilience. This framework achieves automation, standardization, and visualization of the testing process through clear hierarchical decoupling. ResBench simulates adverse events and injects them during normal transaction processing, utilizing a module to gather multiple metrics for the evaluation model. We assess database resilience across eight dimensions: throughput, latency, stability, resistance, recovery, disturbance period, adaptation capability and metric deviation. All the results are presented to users via a user-friendly graphical interface. We demonstrate the execution process and result interpretation of ResBench using two types of adversity datasets.

TL;DR: 在GDB-GML流程中加入基于衰减函数的可扩展传递关系以实现知识完备，能发现隐藏知识并显著影响数据结构与模型表现，建议将KC作为标准步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GDB-GML架构忽视知识完备，导致使用不完整或片段化的KG数据作为GML输入，进而造成错误解释和次优模型.

Method: 提出一种在GDB-GML管道中加入可扩展的传递关系（transitive relationships）方法，使用衰减函数在网络上确定性地传播信息以完成隐含知识，并在实验中评估其对拓扑与数据动态的影响.

Result: 实验显示引入的传递关系与KC阶段显著重塑数据拓扑与整体动态，改变度分布、连通性及下游任务指标，证明了该架构的必要性和有效性.

Conclusion: 引入知识完备（KC）阶段能显著改变图数据库-图机器学习（GDB-GML）应用的数据拓扑与行为，从而影响模型性能和评估指标.

Abstract: Graph Machine Learning (GML) with Graph Databases (GDBs) has gained significant relevance in recent years, due to its ability to handle complex interconnected data and apply ML techniques using Graph Data Science (GDS). However, a critical gap exists in the current way GDB-GML applications analyze data, especially in terms of Knowledge Completion (KC) in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In particular, current architectures ignore KC, working on datasets that appear incomplete or fragmented, despite they actually contain valuable hidden knowledge. This limitation may cause wrong interpretations when these data are used as input for GML models.
  This paper proposes an innovative architecture that integrates a KC phase into GDB-GML applications, demonstrating how revealing hidden knowledge can heavily impact datasets' behavior and metrics. For this purpose, we introduce scalable transitive relationships, which are links that propagate information over the network and modelled by a decay function, allowing a deterministic knowledge flows across multiple nodes.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our intuition radically reshapes both topology and overall dataset dynamics, underscoring the need for this new GDB-GML architecture to produce better models and unlock the full potential of graph-based data analysis.
