TL;DR: 提出FOFPred：统一VLM+扩散架构从噪声网络视频字幕中学习语言条件光流预测，能在机器人控制与视频生成任务中展示通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来的空间密集运动表示（如光流）对控制和生成任务价值巨大，但如何从嘈杂的真实世界数据中学习可泛化的像素级未来运动表示尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出的FOFPred使用统一的视觉语言模型与扩散模型架构，结合关键数据预处理和强图像预训练，在网络规模的人类活动视频-字幕数据上训练，随后扩展到机器人操控与视频生成两个下游任务。

Result: FOFPred提出了一种结合统一视觉语言模型（VLM）与扩散生成架构的语言条件光流预测方法，旨在从大规模网络人类活动视频与字幕中学习可泛化到控制与生成任务的像素级未来运动表示。

Conclusion: 基于图像预训练和关键数据预处理，FOFPred在机器人操控与语言驱动的视频生成两个下游任务上展示了跨领域的适用性，证明统一VLM-扩散体系结构与从多样化网络数据学习对未来光流预测的有效性。

Abstract: Future motion representations, such as optical flow, offer immense value for control and generative tasks. However, forecasting generalizable spatially dense motion representations remains a key challenge, and learning such forecasting from noisy, real-world data remains relatively unexplored. We introduce FOFPred, a novel language-conditioned optical flow forecasting model featuring a unified Vision-Language Model (VLM) and Diffusion architecture. This unique combination enables strong multimodal reasoning with pixel-level generative fidelity for future motion prediction. Our model is trained on web-scale human activity data-a highly scalable but unstructured source. To extract meaningful signals from this noisy video-caption data, we employ crucial data preprocessing techniques and our unified architecture with strong image pretraining. The resulting trained model is then extended to tackle two distinct downstream tasks in control and generation. Evaluations across robotic manipulation and video generation under language-driven settings establish the cross-domain versatility of FOFPred, confirming the value of a unified VLM-Diffusion architecture and scalable learning from diverse web data for future optical flow prediction.

*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ICONIC-444: 3.1M industrial images, 444 classes, four OOD tasks, baselines for 22 methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of large, high-quality, realistically captured datasets with well-defined near- to far-OOD categories for systematic evaluation of OOD detection methods across fine- and coarse-grained tasks.

Method: Introduce dataset and benchmark methodology

Result: Created ICONIC-444 dataset with 3.1M images across 444 industrial classes; defined four reference tasks; evaluated 22 post-hoc OOD detection methods and provided baseline metrics.

Conclusion: ICONIC-444 fills a gap by providing large-scale, realistic industrial data with graded OOD difficulties and benchmark tasks to accelerate OOD detection research.

Abstract: Current progress in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is limited by the lack of large, high-quality datasets with clearly defined OOD categories across varying difficulty levels (near- to far-OOD) that support both fine- and coarse-grained computer vision tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce ICONIC-444 (Image Classification and OOD Detection with Numerous Intricate Complexities), a specialized large-scale industrial image dataset containing over 3.1 million RGB images spanning 444 classes tailored for OOD detection research. Captured with a prototype industrial sorting machine, ICONIC-444 closely mimics real-world tasks. It complements existing datasets by offering structured, diverse data suited for rigorous OOD evaluation across a spectrum of task complexities. We define four reference tasks within ICONIC-444 to benchmark and advance OOD detection research and provide baseline results for 22 state-of-the-art post-hoc OOD detection methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将基于车载“inside-out”的先进3D感知与跟踪方法迁移到“outside-in”静态基础设施摄像头网络，解决相机布置异构、极端遮挡和Sim2Real域差异，满足大规模工业级部署的精度与实时性需求。

Method: 1) 基于Sparse4D构建，融入绝对世界坐标几何先验以稳定跨视角几何一致性；2) 设计遮挡感知的ReID嵌入模块，增强跨摄像头身份一致性；3) 使用NVIDIA COSMOS生成多样化环境风格进行无监督的Sim2Real数据增强；4) 为MSDA实现TensorRT插件并优化以支持实时多摄像头并发推理。

Conclusion: 通过结合几何先验、遮挡感知ReID、生成式Sim2Real增强与MSDA硬件加速，提出的改进Sparse4D系统在精度与实时性方面均满足大规模基础设施部署需求，并在挑战赛上取得领先成绩。

Abstract: Accurate 3D object perception and multi-target multi-camera (MTMC) tracking are fundamental for the digital transformation of industrial infrastructure. However, transitioning "inside-out" autonomous driving models to "outside-in" static camera networks presents significant challenges due to heterogeneous camera placements and extreme occlusion. In this paper, we present an adapted Sparse4D framework specifically optimized for large-scale infrastructure environments. Our system leverages absolute world-coordinate geometric priors and introduces an occlusion-aware ReID embedding module to maintain identity stability across distributed sensor networks. To bridge the Sim2Real domain gap without manual labeling, we employ a generative data augmentation strategy using the NVIDIA COSMOS framework, creating diverse environmental styles that enhance the model's appearance-invariance. Evaluated on the AI City Challenge 2025 benchmark, our camera-only framework achieves a state-of-the-art HOTA of $45.22$. Furthermore, we address real-time deployment constraints by developing an optimized TensorRT plugin for Multi-Scale Deformable Aggregation (MSDA). Our hardware-accelerated implementation achieves a $2.15\times$ speedup on modern GPU architectures, enabling a single Blackwell-class GPU to support over 64 concurrent camera streams.

### [4] [Can Vision-Language Models Understand Construction Workers? An Exploratory Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10835)
*Hieu Bui,Nathaniel E. Chodosh,Arash Tavakoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估GPT-4o、Florence 2、LLaVa-1.5在建筑现场静态图像上识别人为动作与情绪：GPT-4o最佳（动作F1=0.756，情绪F1=0.712），其他两者中等或较差；模型易混淆语义相近类别；需领域适配与时序/多模态增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 施工现场人员行为与情绪识别对安全与效率至关重要，但标注数据稀缺，通用视觉-语言模型可能提供无需大量领域标注的初步识别能力。

Method: 使用1000张经注释的静态现场图像（10类动作、10类情绪），通过统一的推理管线对GPT-4o、Florence 2、LLaVa-1.5生成预测，并计算精确率、召回率、F1与混淆矩阵；比较模型间性能差异。

Result: GPT-4o在动作识别上平均F1=0.756、准确率0.799；情绪识别F1=0.712、准确率0.773；Florence 2分别为F1=0.497与0.414；LLaVa-1.5分别为F1=0.466与0.461。所有模型在语义近似类别上出现显著混淆。

Conclusion: General-purpose VLMs show promising baseline performance for detecting worker actions and emotions in construction images, but fall short for deployment without domain adaptation or additional sensing/temporal modeling.

Abstract: As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.

### [5] [One Model, Many Behaviors: Training-Induced Effects on Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10836)
*Gerhard Krumpl,Henning Avenhaus,Horst Possegger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在ResNet-50上对56个不同训练策略的模型和21种后处理OOD方法做大规模评测，发现ID准确率与OOD性能呈非单调关系：先升后降，并且训练策略、检测器选择和OOD效果高度耦合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解现代训练流水线（旨在最大化ID准确率和泛化）如何影响后续的OOD检测能力，因为现实部署要求模型既高准确又能可靠识别分布外样本。

Method: 固定ResNet-50架构，收集56个通过多种训练策略（如数据增强、正则化、预训练变体等）得到的ImageNet模型；基准21种后验（post-hoc）最先进的OOD检测方法；在8个OOD测试集上评估所有模型-检测器组合，进行系统化比较与分析。

Result: 发现ID准确率与OOD检测性能呈非单调关系（先随准确率上升而提升，随后在使用更高级训练手段超越基线后下降）；不同训练策略对不同检测器的效果影响显著，表明不存在普适的最佳OOD方法。

Conclusion: 训练时追求更高ID准确率并不总是带来更好的OOD检测；在超过基线后，OOD性能可能下降，且最佳OOD策略依赖于训练方法与检测器的组合，没有单一万能方法。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust and reliable machine-learning systems in open-world settings. Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.

### [6] [Effects of Different Attention Mechanisms Applied on 3D Models in Video Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10854)
*Mohammad Rasras,Iuliana Marin,Serban Radu,Irina Mocanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Study reduced temporal input, increased frame resolution, added dropout and ten attention variants to MC3/R3D/R(2+1)D; best 88.98% on UCF101 with multiheaded-att R(2+1)D; temporal info loss hurts performance; attention helps unevenly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test whether increasing spatial resolution while reducing temporal data and adding attention modules can recover lost spatiotemporal features and maintain/action recognition accuracy.

Method: Describe methods: constructed modified 3D ResNet variants (MC3,R3D,R(2+1)D) with dropout and ten attention-based variants each (CBAM, TCN, multi-headed, channel attention etc.), trained on UCF101; evaluated accuracy and class-level behavior.

Result: Best accuracy 88.98% for modified R(2+1)D with multiheaded attention; overall variants showed differing class-level effects; reduced temporal info but higher frame resolution harmed temporal feature capture.

Conclusion: Missing temporal features significantly impact performance of increased-resolution, restricted-temporal models; attention modules can partially compensate with varying class-level effects.

Abstract: Human action recognition has become an important research focus in computer vision due to the wide range of applications where it is used. 3D Resnet-based CNN models, particularly MC3, R3D, and R(2+1)D, have different convolutional filters to extract spatiotemporal features. This paper investigates the impact of reducing the captured knowledge from temporal data, while increasing the resolution of the frames. To establish this experiment, we created similar designs to the three originals, but with a dropout layer added before the final classifier. Secondly, we then developed ten new versions for each one of these three designs. The variants include special attention blocks within their architecture, such as convolutional block attention module (CBAM), temporal convolution networks (TCN), in addition to multi-headed and channel attention mechanisms. The purpose behind that is to observe the extent of the influence each of these blocks has on performance for the restricted-temporal models. The results of testing all the models on UCF101 have shown accuracy of 88.98% for the variant with multiheaded attention added to the modified R(2+1)D. This paper concludes the significance of missing temporal features in the performance of the newly created increased resolution models. The variants had different behavior on class-level accuracy, despite the similarity of their enhancements to the overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者将通用的提示式分割模型SAM3通过在大规模医用2D/3D数据集上进行全参数微调，得到Medical SAM3，实现了面向医学影像的提示驱动分割。相比原始SAM3在医学域的性能退化，本文通过33个数据集、10种模态的微调，显著提升了在语义模糊、复杂形态和长程3D上下文场景下的分割性能，证明了整体模型适配的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始SAM3在医学影像上表现显著下降，主要依赖几何先验（如来自真值边界框的强提示），因此仅靠工程式提示无法解决严重的域迁移问题，需通过对模型进行整体微调以获得域特定表示并保持提示灵活性。

Method: 在33个涵盖10种模态的2D和3D医学数据集上对SAM3进行全参数微调，使用配对的分割掩码和文本提示进行训练，以保留提示驱动能力同时学习医学域的特征表示。系统性分析了原始SAM3在医学数据上的性能退化及对几何先验的依赖，验证微调策略的有效性。

Result: Medical SAM3在器官、模态与维度多样的任务上均显著优于原始SAM3，特别是在语义不确定、形态复杂和需要长程三维上下文的困难场景中提升明显。

Conclusion: 通过在大规模异构医学影像上进行全模型微调，可获得通用的文本引导医学分割基础模型，强调了在严重域迁移下进行整体模型适配的重要性。

Abstract: Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift. Code and model will be made available at https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3.

### [8] [FrankenMotion: Part-level Human Motion Generation and Composition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10909)
*Chuqiao Li,Xianghui Xie,Yong Cao,Andreas Geiger,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Built LLM-assisted dataset of temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and proposed FrankenMotion, a diffusion model guided per body part by temporal prompts, achieving superior, controllable motion generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-motion lacks fine-grained part-level, temporally-resolved annotations limiting per-part control; aim to enable atomic, asynchronous part motions and improve controllability and compositionality.

Method: Construct dataset with LLMs to create temporally-aware part-level annotations; diffusion-based part-aware motion generation where each body part guided by temporally-structured prompt.

Result: Created high-quality dataset with atomic, asynchronous part-level annotations; implemented FrankenMotion diffusion model enabling spatial and temporal control; outperforms baselines and composes unseen motions.

Conclusion: FrankenMotion demonstrates better controllability and generation quality through part-level, temporally-aware annotations and diffusion-based modeling; dataset and code to be released.

Abstract: Human motion generation from text prompts has made remarkable progress in recent years. However, existing methods primarily rely on either sequence-level or action-level descriptions due to the absence of fine-grained, part-level motion annotations. This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control. Experiments demonstrate that FrankenMotion outperforms all previous baseline models adapted and retrained for our setting, and our model can compose motions unseen during training. Our code and dataset will be publicly available upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Use SSL (DINO) to guide LDM to synthesize DUV-FSM patches, combine with real data to fine-tune ViT, achieving 96.47% accuracy and FID 45.72


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack of annotated DUV-FSM data for intraoperative margin assessment in BCS; need high-quality synthetic data to train robust models

Method: Self-Supervised Learning-guided Latent Diffusion Model; fine-tuned DINO teacher to provide embeddings; combine real+synthetic to train ViT; patch prediction aggregation for WSI classification

Result: Generated high-quality synthetic DUV-FSM patches leading to improved classifier performance

Conclusion: Method achieves 96.47% accuracy and FID 45.72, outperforming class-conditioned baselines

Abstract: Breast-Conserving Surgery (BCS) requires precise intraoperative margin assessment to preserve healthy tissue. Deep Ultraviolet Fluorescence Scanning Microscopy (DUV-FSM) offers rapid, high-resolution surface imaging for this purpose; however, the scarcity of annotated DUV data hinders the training of robust deep learning models. To address this, we propose an Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)-guided Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to generate high-quality synthetic training patches. By guiding the LDM with embeddings from a fine-tuned DINO teacher, we inject rich semantic details of cellular structures into the synthetic data. We combine real and synthetic patches to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT), utilizing patch prediction aggregation for WSI-level classification. Experiments using 5-fold cross-validation demonstrate that our method achieves 96.47 % accuracy and reduces the FID score to 45.72, significantly outperforming class-conditioned baselines.

TL;DR: 提出RobuMTL，通过输入驱动的LoRA专家混合选择提高多任务在恶劣天气下的鲁棒性，在PASCAL和NYUD-v2上显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对现实世界中天气、光照等视觉退化，单一模型或固定MTL结构难以保证稳定性能，需要输入自适应的模块化适配策略。

Method: Introduce RobuMTL: adaptive LoRA mixture-of-experts for robust MTL

Result: RobuMTL selects task-specific hierarchical LoRA modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations to handle visual degradation.

Conclusion: RobuMTL improves robustness significantly on PASCAL and NYUD-v2 compared to baselines, especially under mixed adverse conditions.

Abstract: Robust Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is crucial for autonomous systems operating in real-world environments, where adverse weather conditions can severely degrade model performance and reliability. In this paper, we introduce RobuMTL, a novel architecture designed to adaptively address visual degradation by dynamically selecting task-specific hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules and a LoRA expert squad based on input perturbations in a mixture-of-experts fashion. Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions. To validate our approach, we evaluated it on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets and compared it against single-task models, standard MTL baselines, and state-of-the-art methods. On the PASCAL benchmark, RobuMTL delivers a +2.8% average relative improvement under single perturbations and up to +44.4% under mixed weather conditions compared to the MTL baseline. On NYUD-v2, RobuMTL achieves a +9.7% average relative improvement across tasks. The code is available at GitHub.

### [12] [Sparse Data Tree Canopy Segmentation: Fine-Tuning Leading Pretrained Models on Only 150 Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10931)
*David Szczecina,Hudson Sun,Anthony Bertnyk,Niloofar Azad,Kyle Gao,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在150张带注释的极小且不平衡航拍图像数据上进行树冠检测对深度模型构成挑战。对比了五种代表性架构（YOLOv11、Mask R-CNN、DeepLabv3、Swin-UNet、DINOv2），结果表明预训练的卷积类模型（尤其YOLOv11与Mask R-CNN）在小样本下泛化更好；Transformer类模型表现较差，可能源于任务差异、数据需求高及缺乏强烈的归纳偏置。结论是：在数据极少时，轻量级CNN方法更可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中航拍树冠标注昂贵且样本稀缺。Solafune竞赛模拟这种极端少样本不平衡场景（仅150张标注图），迫切需要评估现有分割/检测架构在低数据量下的表现，以指导实践中模型选择与训练策略。

Method: 选取五种代表性模型：YOLOv11（目标检测/实例分割方向的轻量CNN）、Mask R-CNN（实例分割、FPN骨干）、DeepLabv3（语义分割、空洞卷积）、Swin-UNet（Transformer骨干的UNet变体）、DINOv2（自监督/检测预训练的视觉Transformer）。在相同预训练初始化下，采用统一训练管线：数据增强策略、学习率调度、损失函数与评估指标（AP、mIoU等）；比较在训练/验证集上的泛化、过拟合程度及对增强策略的敏感性。并分析语义分割与实例分割目标之间的差异如何影响结果。

Result: 实验显示YOLOv11与Mask R-CNN在验证集上取得明显更高的AP与mIoU，训练更稳定、过拟合程度较低。DeepLabv3、Swin-UNet与DINOv2在小样本上表现不佳：语义分割模型因标签与任务不匹配导致边界、重叠区域处理差；Transformer模型则表现出更高的方差与对数据增强/大量预训练的依赖。进一步的消融表明适度的强增强、使用预训练卷积骨干以及实例分割损失更有助于提升表现。

Conclusion: 在极少标注样本且不平衡的航拍树冠检测场景下，具有强归纳偏置的预训练卷积网络（如YOLOv11、Mask R-CNN）比Transformer类模型更鲁棒。若采用Transformer，需要更大规模的预训练或更激进的数据增强/合成数据来缓解低数据问题。

Abstract: Tree canopy detection from aerial imagery is an important task for environmental monitoring, urban planning, and ecosystem analysis. Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补仅靠影像而缺乏患者主诉导致的诊断准确性不足

Method: Generate Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) analysis

Result: Dialogues between DocVLM and PatientVLM with symptom profiles; fine-tuning DocVLM; small-scale clinical validation

Conclusion: Dialogue-based supervision improves diagnostic performance over image-only training

Abstract: Traditionally, AI research in medical diagnosis has largely centered on image analysis. While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM. This dialogue-based supervision leads to substantial gains over image-only training, highlighting the value of realistic symptom elicitation for diagnosis.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with complex clinical reasoning required in real-world scenarios. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored to enhance reasoning capabilities, existing approaches face critical mismatches: the scarcity of deep reasoning data, cold-start limits multi-specialty alignment, and standard RL algorithms fail to model clinical reasoning diversity. We propose MMedExpert-R1, a novel reasoning MedVLM that addresses these challenges through domain-specific adaptation and clinical guideline reinforcement. We construct MMedExpert, a high-quality dataset of 10K samples across four specialties with step-by-step reasoning traces. Our Domain-Specific Adaptation (DSA) creates specialty-specific LoRA modules to provide diverse initialization, while Guideline-Based Advantages (GBA) explicitly models different clinical reasoning perspectives to align with real-world diagnostic strategies. Conflict-Aware Capability Integration then merges these specialized experts into a unified agent, ensuring robust multi-specialty alignment. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with our 7B model achieving 27.50 on MedXpert-MM and 83.03 on OmniMedVQA, establishing a robust foundation for reliable multimodal medical reasoning systems.

TL;DR: 提出IDDR-NGP，在Instant-NGP上结合LPIPS与多视图补偿损失，端到端去除多种三维场景干扰物；构建新数据集并在多种干扰下表现优秀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多针对特定类型干扰物（如去雪），缺乏统一方法处理多种3D场景中的干扰；希望将隐式3D表示与2D检测器结合，实现从多张被污染图像高效恢复干净3D场景。

Method: 在Instant-NGP基础上加入2D检测器用于识别干扰像素，设计LPIPS感知损失和多视图补偿损失(MVCL)用于联合优化渲染结果，信息由多视图被污染图像聚合，模型可端到端训练；提供合成与真实标注数据用于训练与评估。

Result: 提出了一种名为IDDR-NGP的统一去除干扰物方法，直接在Instant-NGP上操作，能够去除多种类型的三维场景干扰物（雪花、彩带、落叶、花瓣等）；结合隐式3D表示与2D检测器，通过LPIPS损失和多视图补偿损失联合优化，端到端训练以合成高质量3D场景；构建了包含合成与真实干扰物的新基准数据集并做了广泛实验，结果显示在多种干扰物去除上有效且稳健，并与SOTA去雪方法相当。

Conclusion: IDDR-NGP是一种通用且有效的隐式3D干扰物去除方法，能处理多种干扰类型并可端到端训练，实验验证了其效果和鲁棒性，同时提供了新的基准数据集供后续研究。

Abstract: This paper presents the first unified distractor removal method, named IDDR-NGP, which directly operates on Instant-NPG. The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling can create remarkably realistic synthetic videos, making it increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish them from real ones and necessitating reliable detection methods.
  However, two key limitations hinder the development of this field.
  \textbf{From the dataset perspective}, existing datasets are often limited in scale and constructed using outdated or narrowly scoped generative models, making it difficult to capture the diversity and rapid evolution of modern generative techniques. Moreover, the dataset construction process frequently prioritizes quantity over quality, neglecting essential aspects such as semantic diversity, scenario coverage, and technological representativeness.
  \textbf{From the benchmark perspective}, current benchmarks largely remain at the stage of dataset creation, leaving many fundamental issues and in-depth analysis yet to be systematically explored.
  Addressing this gap, we propose AIGVDBench, a benchmark designed to be comprehensive and representative, covering \textbf{31} state-of-the-art generation models and over \textbf{440,000} videos. By executing more than \textbf{1,500} evaluations on \textbf{33} existing detectors belonging to four distinct categories. This work presents \textbf{8 in-depth analyses} from multiple perspectives and identifies \textbf{4 novel findings} that offer valuable insights for future research. We hope this work provides a solid foundation for advancing the field of AI-generated video detection.

*Takuya Murakawa,Takumi Fukuzawa,Ning Ding,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M3DDM+，通过在训练时对所有帧使用统一的掩码方向和宽度并对预训练模型微调，解决M3DDM在摄像机运动少或外扩区域大时出现的空间模糊和时间不一致问题，提升视觉质量与时间一致性且保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始M3DDM在视频外扩场景下计算高效，但在信息受限（如相机运动小或外扩区域大）时帧间信息不足，导致生成结果出现空间模糊和时间不一致。分析指出根因是训练与推理阶段掩码策略不匹配：训练时每帧掩码方向与宽度随机，而推理时需要在整段视频中保持一致的外扩方向。

Method: 提出M3DDM+：在训练阶段对所有帧使用统一的掩码方向与宽度（即一致性掩码），随后在已预训练的M3DDM模型上进行微调，以弥合训练-推理间的策略差异。该方法保持原方法的潜变量扩散框架和计算优势，仅调整掩码生成与微调过程。

Result: 在多种信息受限场景（如平移/静止摄像机或大外扩宽度）上的实验显示，M3DDM+在视觉保真度和时间一致性上显著优于原始M3DDM，同时保持类似的推理速度与计算开销。作者提供了开源代码。

Conclusion: 通过在训练中引入跨帧一致的掩码策略并对预训练模型微调，M3DDM+有效解决了训练-推理掩码不匹配导致的质量下降问题，在保证计算效率的前提下提升了视频外扩的空间与时间质量。

Abstract: M3DDM provides a computationally efficient framework for video outpainting via latent diffusion modeling. However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/tamaki-lab/M3DDM-Plus.

TL;DR: Proposes physics-aware RL and MDcycle to enforce rigid-body collision rules in video generators, validated on a new PhysRVGBench, improving physical realism while maintaining generation quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based video generation lacks incorporation of physical principles, particularly rigid body collisions, leading to unrealistic videos. Existing pretrain-finetune paradigms ignore object rigidity and treat constraints as optional conditions during optimization, limiting physical realism.

Method: Introduce a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional latent/pixel spaces rather than as soft conditions. Extend this into a unified Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle) framework enabling substantial fine-tuning while preserving physics-grounded feedback. Construct a new benchmark PhysRVGBench for evaluation.

Result: Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on PhysRVGBench demonstrate improved physical realism in generated videos, better adherence to collision dynamics, and preserved generative quality after fine-tuning compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Embedding hard physical constraints via reinforcement learning and the MDcycle framework effectively improves physical fidelity of transformer-based video generation, addressing rigidity and collision modeling shortcomings in current paradigms.

Abstract: Physical principles are fundamental to realistic visual simulation, but remain a significant oversight in transformer-based video generation. This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对像素级姿态-参考图像强绑定，导致无法处理多角色、多类型与位移不对齐问题，故提出解除再绑定的解决方案以实现更灵活的运动传递

Method: Unbind-Rebind framework with pose shift encoder and semantic+spatial rebind

Result: State-of-the-art animation of multiple, diverse, and misaligned subjects; outperforms baselines on CoDanceBench and existing datasets

Conclusion: CoDance effectively learns location-agnostic motion via stochastic pose perturbations and achieves precise subject-targeted animation using text and mask guidance, enabling robust multi-subject generalization

Abstract: Character image animation is gaining significant importance across various domains, driven by the demand for robust and flexible multi-subject rendering. While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench. Extensive experiments on CoDanceBench and existing datasets show that CoDance achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting remarkable generalization across diverse subjects and spatial layouts. The code and weights will be open-sourced.

Conclusion: 该方法通过图平滑模块和增强的局部几何学习模块，有效优化了点云图结构，减少边界点稀疏连接和交叉区域噪声连接的负面影响，从而提升点云分类与分割任务表现。

Abstract: Graph-based methods have proven to be effective in capturing relationships among points for 3D point cloud analysis. However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出VIGA：一种基于闭环迭代写-运行-渲染-比较-修正的视觉逆图形代理，结合技能库与演进记忆，实现跨任务、无微调的高效图形重构与编辑，显著提升多个基准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大模型缺乏细粒度的空间和物理归因能力，无法一次性输出可编辑的图形程序。论文认为需要通过交错的多模态推理和迭代执行验证才能弥合这一差距。

Method: VIGA使用交替的生成器与验证器技能库和不断演进的上下文记忆（包含计划、代码差异和渲染历史），以支持长时序推理；整体流程为从空世界开始，通过生成代码或操作、运行/渲染环境、比较真实目标与渲染结果并修正，形成闭环迭代。

Result: 在多个基准上显著优于one-shot基线：BlenderGym提升35.32%，SlideBench提升117.17%，在新引入的BlenderBench上提升124.70%。VIGA不依赖微调、适配多种基础VLM，且为评估异构模型提供统一协议。

Conclusion: VIGA通过闭环的write-run-render-compare-revise流程，将视觉逆图形重构问题转为交互式、多模态的迭代执行与验证过程，从而能在不依赖额外模块或微调的前提下，显著提升一系列任务（如3D重建、场景编辑、4D物理交互、2D文档编辑）上的性能。

Abstract: Vision-as-inverse-graphics, the concept of reconstructing an image as an editable graphics program is a long-standing goal of computer vision. Yet even strong VLMs aren't able to achieve this in one-shot as they lack fine-grained spatial and physical grounding capability. Our key insight is that closing this gap requires interleaved multimodal reasoning through iterative execution and verification. Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.

Conclusion: 本文通过层堆叠视角分析线性注意力与softmax注意力的差异，提出细粒度层级混合策略，并设计SoLA-Vision框架，在少量全局softmax层配合线性注意力下获得准确率与计算成本的良好折中。

Abstract: Standard softmax self-attention excels in vision tasks but incurs quadratic complexity O(N^2), limiting high-resolution deployment. Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin. Code will be released.

Conclusion: ESD通过对Landsat和MODIS观测进行量化嵌入，实现了极高的数据压缩和语义化特征表示，为行星尺度遥感分析提供了轻量化可用的数据基础。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of satellite-borne Earth Observation (EO) systems has revolutionized terrestrial monitoring, yielding petabyte-scale archives. However, the immense computational and storage requirements for global-scale analysis often preclude widespread use, hindering planetary-scale studies. To address these barriers, we present Embedded Seamless Data (ESD), an ultra-lightweight, 30-m global Earth embedding database spanning the 25-year period from 2000 to 2024. By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations. Rigorous validation demonstrates high reconstructive fidelity (MAE: 0.0130; RMSE: 0.0179; CC: 0.8543). By condensing the annual phenological cycle into 12 temporal steps, the embeddings provide inherent denoising and a semantically organized space that outperforms raw reflectance in land-cover classification, achieving 79.74% accuracy (vs. 76.92% for raw fusion). With robust few-shot learning capabilities and longitudinal consistency, ESD provides a versatile foundation for democratizing planetary-scale research and advancing next-generation geospatial artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 现有联合生成或SDS方法在结构对齐、速度和生成质量上存在不足，尤其SDS存在耗时、模式崩溃和卡通化问题；因此需要一种更快且能保持结构对齐的联合生成方法。

Method: 在结构化潜空间上的任意Rectified Flow模型基础上，通过对样本空间中一个段进行联合传输（joint transport of a segment）来实现成对样本的结构对齐生成，避免SDS的高昂计算和模式崩溃，兼容图像、视频和3D形状生成任务。

Result: 提出了一种用于联合推断成对结构对齐样本的新型多模态算法，基于Rectified Flow模型。该方法通过在样本空间中对一个段进行联合传输来实现结构对齐生成，相比SDS方法在推理时间更快、减少模式崩溃并提升视觉质量。方法可建立在任意作用于结构化潜空间的Rectified Flow模型之上，适用于图像、视频和3D形状生成。在图像和视频生成上提升了现有最先进方法；在3D生成上与现有方法质量相当，但速度快几个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了成对样本的结构对齐生成，提升了图像和视频生成质量，并在3D生成中显著提高了推理速度，同时保持可比质量。

Abstract: We suggest a new multi-modal algorithm for joint inference of paired structurally aligned samples with Rectified Flow models. While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches. We demonstrate a high degree of structural alignment for the sample pairs obtained with our method and a high visual quality of the samples. Our method improves the state-of-the-art for image and video generation pipelines. For 3D generation, it is able to show comparable quality while working orders of magnitude faster.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced image analysis across diverse domains but often depends on large, annotated datasets for success. Transfer learning addresses this challenge by utilizing pre-trained models to tackle new tasks with limited labeled data. However, discrepancies between source and target domains can hinder effective transfer learning. We introduce BioTune, a novel adaptive fine-tuning technique utilizing evolutionary optimization. BioTune enhances transfer learning by optimally choosing which layers to freeze and adjusting learning rates for unfrozen layers. Through extensive evaluation on nine image classification datasets, spanning natural and specialized domains such as medical imaging, BioTune demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency over state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods, including AutoRGN and LoRA, highlighting its adaptability to various data characteristics and distribution changes. Additionally, BioTune consistently achieves top performance across four different CNN architectures, underscoring its flexibility. Ablation studies provide valuable insights into the impact of BioTune's key components on overall performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/davilac/BioTune.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督多场景（UMS）行人重新识别任务，利用图文知识建模（ITKM）在单一框架下整合多种场景（跨分辨率、换装等）。方法基于CLIP，分三阶段：引入场景嵌入并微调、学习文本嵌入并加上多场景分离损失、通过聚类与实例级异构匹配获得可靠正样本并动态更新文本表示。实验显示方法在多场景条件下优于场景专用方法并具有良好泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ReID工作多聚焦于单一场景（如可见-红外、换装或分辨率变化），缺乏统一的无监督方法来同时处理多种场景。作者希望利用视觉-语言模型（CLIP）的表征能力，在不依赖人工标注的情况下，通过图像文本耦合来提升跨场景ReID性能与泛化性。

Method: 基于预训练CLIP，ITKM三阶段：
- Stage I：在图像编码器中引入场景嵌入，并微调整个编码器以自适应多场景知识。
- Stage II：学习一组与Stage I伪标签关联的文本嵌入，同时加入多场景分离损失以增大不同场景文本表示间的差异。
- Stage III：先利用聚类级与实例级的异构匹配模块获取场景内可靠异构正样本（例如可见与红外同人），然后采用动态文本表示更新策略以保持文本与图像监督的一致性。

Result: 在多场景数据集上进行实验，ITKM优于现有的场景专用方法，并通过整合多场景知识提升了整体性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ITKM提出了一种有效利用CLIP进行无监督多场景ReID的框架，通过场景嵌入、文本嵌入优化、多场景分离损失以及异构匹配与动态文本更新，成功提高了跨场景识别性能，证明了将视觉-语言知识引入ReID的潜力。

Abstract: We propose unsupervised multi-scenario (UMS) person re-identification (ReID) as a new task that expands ReID across diverse scenarios (cross-resolution, clothing change, etc.) within a single coherent framework. To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations. In Stage III, we first introduce cluster-level and instance-level heterogeneous matching modules to obtain reliable heterogeneous positive pairs (e.g., a visible image and an infrared image of the same person) within each scenario. Next, we propose a dynamic text representation update strategy to maintain consistency between text and image supervision signals. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate the superiority and generalizability of ITKM; it not only outperforms existing scenario-specific methods but also enhances overall performance by integrating knowledge from multiple scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量非对称双编码器框架，学习风格不变的视觉嵌入，通过实例对齐与类级语义一致性将视觉嵌入锚定到语言无关的语义原型，在多语言和多书写风格下实现鲁棒检索；在单语和跨语检索上优于28个基线，参数远小于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写词检索在数字档案管理中重要，但受手写体差异大和跨语言语义差异影响。大规模视觉-语言模型虽有效但计算资源高，难以在边缘设备部署，因此需要低参数、高效且跨语义、跨脚本鲁棒的方法。

Method: 设计轻量非对称双编码器：视觉分支学习统一、风格不变的嵌入；通过实例级对齐（增强样本对齐）和类级语义一致性（将嵌入与语言无关的语义原型对齐）联合优化，训练时使用语义原型作为锚点，推理时只需轻量视觉编码器实现高效检索。

Result: 在多个单语检索基准上超过28个对比方法并达到SOTA；在跨语检索（查询与目标语言不同）任务中也展示了强大的跨语义表示能力；模型参数显著少于现有模型，适合边缘部署。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在保持低参数量的同时，能学习跨脚本、风格不变的视觉语义表示，在单语和跨语手写词检索任务上均取得了领先性能，适合资源受限场景部署。

Abstract: Handwritten word retrieval is vital for digital archives but remains challenging due to large handwriting variability and cross-lingual semantic gaps. While large vision-language models offer potential solutions, their prohibitive computational costs hinder practical edge deployment. To address this, we propose a lightweight asymmetric dual-encoder framework that learns unified, style-invariant visual embeddings. By jointly optimizing instance-level alignment and class-level semantic consistency, our approach anchors visual embeddings to language-agnostic semantic prototypes, enforcing invariance across scripts and writing styles. Experiments show that our method outperforms 28 baselines and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on within-language retrieval benchmarks. We further conduct explicit cross-lingual retrieval, where the query language differs from the target language, to validate the effectiveness of the learned cross-lingual representations. Achieving strong performance with only a fraction of the parameters required by existing models, our framework enables accurate and resource-efficient cross-script handwriting retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FTDMamba网络，包含频域解耦时空相关模块和时序膨胀Mamba模块，并提供新数据集MUVAD，在动态背景无人机视频异常检测上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VAD研究多针对静态背景或固定摄像头的无人机视频，动态背景下多源运动耦合导致误检与漏检，需要专门方法解耦UAV运动与目标运动，并在多尺度上建模时间与空间相关性。

Method: 提出两大模块：1) 频域解耦时空相关模块，通过频率分析分离全局（UAV）运动与局部目标运动并建模时空依赖；2) 时序膨胀Mamba模块，借助Mamba序列建模能力在多时间感受野上学习细粒度时间动态与局部空间结构。并构建MUVAD数据集用于评估。

Result: FTDMamba提出用于无人机视频异常检测的新方法，通过频域解耦和时序膨胀模块来处理动态背景下的运动耦合问题，能更好地区分正常飞行运动与异常事件，并在多尺度时间感受野内联合建模帧间连续性与局部空间相关性。作者还构建了大规模移动无人机VAD数据集MUVAD并在三个数据集上获得SOTA表现。

Conclusion: FTDMamba在动态背景下能有效解耦多源运动、联合建模多尺度时间-空间特征，实验证明其在静态和动态基准集上均达到SOTA，MUVAD数据集可推动移动无人机VAD研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in video anomaly detection (VAD) mainly focus on ground-based surveillance or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) videos with static backgrounds, whereas research on UAV videos with dynamic backgrounds remains limited. Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset. The code and MUVAD dataset will be available at: https://github.com/uavano/FTDMamba.

TL;DR: Distill frozen DINOv2 into ResNet-18 offline, then fine-tune jointly with diffusion policy head for manipulation; yields SOTA data-efficient performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce data requirements for visuomotor policies by combining ViT representation power with CNN data efficiency.

Method: Offline distillation on ImageNet from frozen DINOv2 teacher to ResNet-18 student; then joint fine-tuning of distilled encoder with diffusion policy head on target tasks.

Result: X-Distill: distill DINOv2 ViT into ResNet-18 on ImageNet, then fine-tune with diffusion policy head; outperforms from-scratch ResNet and fine-tuned ViT across simulated and real tasks, surpasses 3D encoders and larger VLMs.

Conclusion: Cross-architecture distillation from large frozen ViT to compact CNN provides powerful visual priors enabling superior data-efficient visuomotor policies.

Abstract: Visuomotor policies often leverage large pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) for their powerful generalization capabilities. However, their significant data requirements present a major challenge in the data-scarce context of most robotic learning settings, where compact CNNs with strong inductive biases can be more easily optimized. To address this trade-off, we introduce X-Distill, a simple yet highly effective method that synergizes the strengths of both architectures. Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 Temporal Token Reuse，通过重用静态区域的特征减少骨干计算，在 UAV 边缘设备上实现近 30% 的加速且损失极小，利于灾害响应的实时航拍视频分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 倾斜航拍视频在灾害响应中能覆盖更大区域，但高分辨率流的视频在 UAV 的 SWaP 限制下无法在边缘实时处理，因此需要减轻计算负担同时保持精度。

Method: 将图像分块为 token，使用轻量相似度度量动态检测静态区域并重用其预计算的深层特征以跳过冗余的骨干网计算；在嵌入式设备上设计自适应推理流程。

Result: 在标准基准和新构建的倾斜洪水数据集上验证，边缘级硬件上实现约 30% 推理延迟降低，mIoU 下降 <0.5%。

Conclusion: TTR 在保留分割精度的同时显著降低了边缘设备上的推理延迟，推动了实时倾斜航拍视频理解的可行性。

Abstract: Effective disaster response relies on rapid disaster response, where oblique aerial video is the primary modality for initial scouting due to its ability to maximize spatial coverage and situational awareness in limited flight time. However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究者需要在不泄露数据、控制成本且高效生成高质量视频实例分割数据的情况下进行标注，现有方案要么昂贵、要么侵犯隐私、要么耗时，故开发本地化的 SAMannotation 工具以填补该空缺。

Method: 将 SAM2 集成至本地人机协同标注流程；修改 SAM2 依赖并加入轻量处理层以减少计算和提高响应；实现持久实例 ID、lock-and-refine 流程、barrier frames 和掩码骨架自动提示；导出 YOLO/PNG 数据和交互日志用于下游研究。

Result: SAMannot 是一个集成 SAM2 的本地开源视频分割标注框架，针对科研场景在隐私、成本和效率之间提供折衷方案。作者对 SAM2 做了依赖修改并添加处理层以降低计算开销，提高吞吐量和界面响应；支持持久实例 ID 管理、基于“锁与细化”的自动化工作流（使用 barrier frames）、以及基于掩码骨架的自动提示机制。输出包括 YOLO/PNG 数据集和交互日志，并在动物行为跟踪与 LVOS/DAVIS 子集上验证。

Conclusion: SAMannot 在保隐私、降低成本的前提下能高效生成研究可用的视频实例分割数据集，通过算法与工程改进（依赖修改、处理层、自动提示等）缓解了 SAM2 的资源瓶颈，并在多场景验证中表现出可行性。

Abstract: Current research workflows for precise video segmentation are often forced into a compromise between labor-intensive manual curation, costly commercial platforms, and/or privacy-compromising cloud-based services. The demand for high-fidelity video instance segmentation in research is often hindered by the bottleneck of manual annotation and the privacy concerns of cloud-based tools. We present SAMannot, an open-source, local framework that integrates the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) into a human-in-the-loop workflow. To address the high resource requirements of foundation models, we modified the SAM2 dependency and implemented a processing layer that minimizes computational overhead and maximizes throughput, ensuring a highly responsive user interface. Key features include persistent instance identity management, an automated ``lock-and-refine'' workflow with barrier frames, and a mask-skeletonization-based auto-prompting mechanism. SAMannot facilitates the generation of research-ready datasets in YOLO and PNG formats alongside structured interaction logs. Verified through animal behavior tracking use-cases and subsets of the LVOS and DAVIS benchmark datasets, the tool provides a scalable, private, and cost-effective alternative to commercial platforms for complex video annotation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出CASWiT，一种双分支Swin Transformer架构，通过低分辨率上下文编码器和高分辨率编码器结合交叉注意力与门控注入实现UHR语义分割，并采用SimMIM风格预训练，实验在IGN FLAIR-HUB和URUR数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHR语义分割受限于Transformer的二次复杂度，难以同时兼顾大范围上下文和高空间分辨率。提出双分支方案以在保持细节的同时引入广域上下文。

Method: 构建双分支架构：1) 上下文编码器处理下采样邻域以捕获长程依赖；2) 高分辨率编码器对UHR补丁提取细粒度特征；3) 交叉尺度融合模块采用交叉注意力和门控特征注入将低分辨率上下文信息注入高分辨率token；4) SimMIM式预训练，遮挡75%高分辨率token并遮挡对应的低分辨率中心区域，训练共享编码器与小型解码器重建原始UHR图像。

Result: 在IGN FLAIR-HUB达到65.83% mIoU，比RGB基线高1.78点；在URUR达到49.1% mIoU，比当前SoTA高0.9%（按官方评测协议）。

Conclusion: CASWiT有效将全局上下文注入超高分辨率特征，配合大比例遮挡的SimMIM预训练，显著提升UHR语义分割性能，分别在IGN FLAIR-HUB和URUR上超越基线与SoTA。

Abstract: Semantic ultra high resolution image (UHR) segmentation is essential in remote sensing applications such as aerial mapping and environmental monitoring. Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image. Extensive experiments on the large-scale IGN FLAIR-HUB aerial dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of CASWiT. Our method achieves 65.83% mIoU, outperforming RGB baselines by 1.78 points. On URUR, CASWiT achieves 49.1% mIoU, surpassing the current SoTA by +0.9% under the official evaluation protocol. All codes are provided on: https://huggingface.co/collections/heig-vd-geo/caswit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在SA场景中，关键事件稀少但需高可靠性判断，同时需要细粒度信息与对识别质量的评估。纯VLM虽具解释性但在罕见事件和精细分类上表现有限，故需将VLM与传统CV与逻辑推理结合以提升准确性和可信度。

Method: 方法包括：1) 利用VLM生成高层次、可解释的事件描述；2) 结合传统CV模块（例如检测器/分类器）与逻辑规则对VLM输出进行验证与细化；3) 设计一种智能的微调样本选择策略，用于优先挑选对性能提升最有效的样本；4) 在推理阶段输出理由链，用于评估和说明VLM判断的可信度。

Result: 智能微调策略显著提高了准确率（相较于无指导的样本选择有大幅提升），并在推理时提供了可用于确认或质疑VLM输出的理由，有助于增强SA系统对关键事件的可靠识别与可解释性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出将视觉-语言模型与传统计算机视觉方法通过显式逻辑推理相结合，以提升情境感知（SA）能力，主要在细粒度细节提取、智能微调选择与推理时生成解释三方面带来改进。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer the ability to generate high-level, interpretable descriptions of complex activities from images and videos, making them valuable for situational awareness (SA) applications. In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.

Motivation: 传统的Beer-Lambert色彩去卷积在K>3的mIHC情形中是欠定且不稳定，需一种能分离多种染色并适应队列特性的方案

Method: 使用紧凑的U-Net编码器预测K个非负浓度通道，解码器为带可学习染色矩阵（以典型色调初始化）的可微BL模型；以感知重建损失为主，并加入抑制不必要交叉污染的正则项，训练为无监督

Conclusion: 提出的方法能在多重免疫组化（mIHC）RGB整片切片图像上学习队列特异的染色特性，通过编码器-解码器架构和可微的Beer-Lambert前向模型重建清晰的每种染色浓度图

Abstract: Separating the contributions of individual chromogenic stains in RGB histology whole slide images (WSIs) is essential for stain normalization, quantitative assessment of marker expression, and cell-level readouts in immunohistochemistry (IHC). Classical Beer-Lambert (BL) color deconvolution is well-established for two- or three-stain settings, but becomes under-determined and unstable for multiplex IHC (mIHC) with K>3 chromogens. We present a simple, data-driven encoder-decoder architecture that learns cohort-specific stain characteristics for mIHC RGB WSIs and yields crisp, well-separated per-stain concentration maps. The encoder is a compact U-Net that predicts K nonnegative concentration channels; the decoder is a differentiable BL forward model with a learnable stain matrix initialized from typical chromogen hues. Training is unsupervised with a perceptual reconstruction objective augmented by loss terms that discourage unnecessary stain mixing. On a colorectal mIHC panel comprising 5 stains (H, CDX2, MUC2, MUC5, CD8) we show excellent RGB reconstruction, and significantly reduced inter-channel bleed-through compared with matrix-based deconvolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They use a coupled global context vision transformer to fuse UAV and street-view images to predict building attributes tied to heat; validates with HotSat-1 thermal data; fusion improves accuracy and highlights materials/vegetation linked to lower heat; applied to Dar es Salaam to map inequalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban heat risk is rising, especially in Global South cities with dense, low-cost materials; existing scalable methods to assess building features relevant to heat are lacking; need data-driven tools to target equitable climate adaptation.

Method: A dual-modality cross-view learning framework (CGCViT) fusing UAV and street-view imagery; trained to predict building attributes; thermal infrared measurements from HotSat-1 used to quantify relationships between predicted attributes and surface temperature; evaluated against single-modality baselines and deployed city-wide in Dar es Salaam.

Result: A machine learning framework fusing UAV and street-view imagery (CGCViT) to predict heat-relevant building attributes, validated with HotSat-1 TIR; demonstrates UAV+SV outperforms single modalities by up to 9.3%; finds vegetation, brighter and concrete/clay/wood roofs linked to lower TIR; deployed in Dar es Salaam to reveal household-level heat exposure inequalities.

Conclusion: Cross-view fusion of UAV and street-view imagery via CGCViT enables scalable, fine-grained assessment of building attributes related to heat exposure; this can inform equitable climate adaptation by identifying vulnerable households and materials linked to higher heat risk.

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying human heat exposure, particularly in densely built urban centers of the Global South. Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures. The presence of vegetation surrounding buildings (versus no vegetation), brighter roofing (versus darker roofing), and roofing made of concrete, clay, or wood (versus metal or tarpaulin) are all significantly associated with lower HotSat-1 TIR values. Deployed across the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the proposed framework illustrates how household-level inequalities in heat exposure - often linked to socio-economic disadvantage and reflected in building materials - can be identified and addressed using machine learning. Our results point to the critical role of localized, data-driven risk assessment in shaping climate adaptation strategies that deliver equitable outcomes.

Abstract: Recent progress in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding.

Conclusion: 异质细粒度概率建模与不确定性引导的对比学习能有效缓解CIR中的内在噪声，提高检索鲁棒性与判别力，为多模态检索提供新范式。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables image search by combining a reference image with modification text. Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.

Conclusion: SUG-Occ有效利用场景稀疏性，通过结构一致的稀疏表示和高效的补全与解码策略，在语义体素预测任务中实现了更高的精度与显著的效率提升，适合实时应用。

Abstract: As autonomous driving moves toward full scene understanding, 3D semantic occupancy prediction has emerged as a crucial perception task, offering voxel-level semantics beyond traditional detection and segmentation paradigms. However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the baselines, achieving a 7.34/% improvement in accuracy and a 57.8\% gain in efficiency.

Result: 提出WetSAM框架，实现从稀疏点监督到高质量密集伪标签的生成与联合优化，在八个全球区域上平均F1=85.58%，显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: WetSAM在低标注成本下实现了可扩展、高分辨率和具有强泛化能力的湿地映射，适用于大范围监测

Abstract: Accurate wetland mapping is essential for ecosystem monitoring, yet dense pixel-level annotation is prohibitively expensive and practical applications usually rely on sparse point labels, under which existing deep learning models perform poorly, while strong seasonal and inter-annual wetland dynamics further render single-date imagery inadequate and lead to significant mapping errors; although foundation models such as SAM show promising generalization from point prompts, they are inherently designed for static images and fail to model temporal information, resulting in fragmented masks in heterogeneous wetlands. To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.

Motivation: 提高PCB表面微小缺陷检测精度，解决尺寸微小、纹理相似、尺度分布不均等问题

Method: SME-YOLO methods

Conclusion: 改进损失函数、上采样模块和注意力机制，有效提升了PCB微小缺陷检测性能

Abstract: Surface defects on Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) directly compromise product reliability and safety. However, achieving high-precision detection is challenging because PCB defects are typically characterized by tiny sizes, high texture similarity, and uneven scale distributions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework based on YOLOv11n, named SME-YOLO (Small-target Multi-scale Enhanced YOLO). First, we employ the Normalized Wasserstein Distance Loss (NWDLoss). This metric effectively mitigates the sensitivity of Intersection over Union (IoU) to positional deviations in tiny objects. Second, the original upsampling module is replaced by the Efficient Upsampling Convolution Block (EUCB). By utilizing multi-scale convolutions, the EUCB gradually recovers spatial resolution and enhances the preservation of edge and texture details for tiny defects. Finally, this paper proposes the Multi-Scale Focused Attention (MSFA) module. Tailored to the specific spatial distribution of PCB defects, this module adaptively strengthens perception within key scale intervals, achieving efficient fusion of local fine-grained features and global context information. Experimental results on the PKU-PCB dataset demonstrate that SME-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, compared to the baseline YOLOv11n, SME-YOLO improves mAP by 2.2% and Precision by 4%, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Motivation: Traditional topological tools (e.g., persistent homology) don't capture width/thickness/length, which are important for practical image segmentation; need to preserve these in topology-aware segmentation.

Method: They introduce a new topological framework integrating width into persistent homology via PDE smoothing and upper-level set extrema modification.

Result: A variational segmentation model and loss functions for neural networks that maintain topology and width properties; numerical experiments show preserved connectivity/genus and width attributes.

Conclusion: 该方法在保留连通性、圈数等拓扑不变量的同时，显式嵌入并维持线状结构的厚度和长度等宽度属性，数值实验验证了有效性。

Abstract: Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.

Conclusion: Map2Thought offers explainable 3D understanding via unified spatial maps and deterministic reasoning, reducing supervision needs while improving accuracy.

Abstract: We propose Map2Thought, a framework that enables explicit and interpretable spatial reasoning for 3D VLMs. The framework is grounded in two key components: Metric Cognitive Map (Metric-CogMap) and Cognitive Chain-of-Thought (Cog-CoT). Metric-CogMap provides a unified spatial representation by integrating a discrete grid for relational reasoning with a continuous, metric-scale representation for precise geometric understanding. Building upon the Metric-CogMap, Cog-CoT performs explicit geometric reasoning through deterministic operations, including vector operations, bounding-box distances, and occlusion-aware appearance order cues, producing interpretable inference traces grounded in 3D structure. Experimental results show that Map2Thought enables explainable 3D understanding, achieving 59.9% accuracy using only half the supervision, closely matching the 60.9% baseline trained with the full dataset. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 5.3%, 4.8%, and 4.0% under 10%, 25%, and 50% training subsets, respectively, on the VSI-Bench.

Abstract: Large-scale livestock operations pose significant risks to human health and the environment, while also being vulnerable to threats such as infectious diseases and extreme weather events. As the number of such operations continues to grow, accurate and scalable mapping has become increasingly important. In this work, we present an infrastructure-first, explainable pipeline for identifying and characterizing Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) from aerial and satellite imagery. Our method (1) detects candidate infrastructure (e.g., barns, feedlots, manure lagoons, silos) with a domain-tuned YOLOv8 detector, then derives SAM2 masks from these boxes and filters component-specific criteria, (2) extracts structured descriptors (e.g., counts, areas, orientations, and spatial relations) and fuses them with deep visual features using a lightweight spatial cross-attention classifier, and (3) outputs both CAFO type predictions and mask-level attributions that link decisions to visible infrastructure. Through comprehensive evaluation, we show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Swin-B+PRISM-CAFO surpassing the best performing baseline by up to 15\%. Beyond strong predictive performance across diverse U.S. regions, we run systematic gradient--activation analyses that quantify the impact of domain priors and show ho

Motivation: 面对VLM在处理复杂多模态任务时KV缓存快速膨胀带来的内存与计算瓶颈，需将MHA压缩为更高效的MLA而无需重新预训练。

Method: 提出两项核心技术：①模态自适应的部分RoPE策略，通过选择性屏蔽非关键维度来同时支持传统与多模态场景；②模态解耦的低秩近似，分别压缩视觉与文本的KV空间；并结合参数高效微调，优化输出激活误差而非参数距离。

Result: 在三种代表性VLM上验证，方法能用极少监督数据恢复原性能，大幅减少KV缓存占用，并能与KV量化配合使用。

Conclusion: MHA2MLA-VLM成功在无需昂贵预训练的情况下，将现有视觉-语言模型适配到多头潜在注意力(MLA)架构，恢复原始性能并显著压缩KV缓存。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) tackle increasingly complex and multimodal tasks, the rapid growth of Key-Value (KV) cache imposes significant memory and computational bottlenecks during inference. While Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA) offers an effective means to compress the KV cache and accelerate inference, adapting existing VLMs to the MLA architecture without costly pretraining remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.

Method: 训练VLA模型以在规划、运动和语言任务监督下将车辆与代理动态编码为潜在token；然后在推演阶段通过语言条件的自回归生成未来潜在token并输出文本响应，使用rollout-consistency损失维持时序一致性；可与RL集成以优化策略。

Conclusion: GeRo能生成与语言对齐的时序场景和动作预测，通过rollout-consistency损失减少漂移，结合RL可取得闭环和开环的SOTA表现，增强零样本鲁棒性与可解释性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as highly effective planning models for end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness. These results highlight the promise of generative, language-conditioned reasoning as a foundation for safer and more interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内环境随时间变化，传统3DSIS缺乏时间推理需要离散匹配；4D LiDAR方法依赖高频观测，难以处理长时域稀疏采样。因而需要一种在稀疏、长时域采样下仍能保持实例时间一致性的分割与关联方法。

Method: ReScene4D基于现有3DSIS模型做适配，采用策略在多个稀疏时间点共享上下文信息以实现实例的时间一致性和增强分割质量；避免依赖高频序列（如4D LiDAR）的方法，设计跨帧信息融合与关联机制，替代离散匹配步骤。

Result: 提出t-mAP指标，用于衡量时间一致性的平均精度。ReScene4D在3RScan上取得SOTA性能，证明跨观测上下文共享能同时改善时序关联与单帧分割质量，并为研究演化中的室内场景建立新基线。

Abstract: Indoor environments evolve as objects move, appear, or disappear. Capturing these dynamics requires maintaining temporally consistent instance identities across intermittently captured 3D scans, even when changes are unobserved. We introduce and formalize the task of temporally sparse 4D indoor semantic instance segmentation (SIS), which jointly segments, identifies, and temporally associates object instances. This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality. To evaluate this task, we define a new metric, t-mAP, that extends mAP to reward temporal identity consistency. ReScene4D achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3RScan dataset, establishing a new benchmark for understanding evolving indoor scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.

Abstract: Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/ZrH42/UniX.
