Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 综述遥感领域降维技术，比较方法、呈现应用场景与实践指南，并指出未来研究机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据体量和维度快速增长，使得自动化信息提取面临稀疏性和维度灾难等挑战。为提升机器学习模型的效率与效果，需系统总结和推广降维技术在遥感数据处理各环节的应用。

Method: 本文以文献综述为主，系统梳理和分类DR方法（如线性与非线性降维、矩阵分解、流形学习、深度学习基础的自编码器等），并基于遥感任务需求分析各类方法的优缺点和适用场景。结合案例与实验结果，比较不同DR策略在特征提取和下游任务上的表现，同时讨论实现细节与评价指标。

Conclusion: 本文综述了遥感领域中降维（DR）技术的重要性，强调DR在缓解高维数据带来的稀疏性、效率低下和维度灾难问题方面的核心作用。通过特征提取保留关键信息，DR支持数据压缩、清洗、融合、可视化、异常检测和预测等任务。综述为遥感数据价值链各环节提供实践指南，并指出若干未充分探索的DR算法及其在未来研究中的应用前景。

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

### [2] [Ninja Codes: Neurally Generated Fiducial Markers for Stealthy 6-DoF Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18976)
*Yuichiro Takeuchi,Yusuke Imoto,Shunya Kato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出通过深度网络生成的可伪装姿态标记Ninja Codes，能在不破坏环境美观的情况下提供可靠6-DoF跟踪，适合对外观要求高的应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统显眼的姿态标记在许多场景（艺术、室内设计等）因视觉突兀而不受欢迎，作者希望设计出既能提供可靠位姿信息又能在环境中隐蔽存在的标记系统。

Method: 论文使用端到端的神经网络体系：一个编码器将任意图像转换为经过视觉上微小修改的Ninja Codes；联合训练多个模块（编码器、渲染/打印仿真器、检测器）借鉴深度隐写术技术，使得生成的标记既能被摄像头检测与解码，又在视觉上难以察觉。

Result: 实验表明：Ninja Codes能够在常见室内光照条件下可靠提供定位跟踪，可用普通彩色打印机打印在普通纸张上，能成功融入多样环境纹理，并能用具备现代RGB摄像头的设备进行检测与姿态估计。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种名为Ninja Codes的神经生成可伪装姿态标记方法，能够将标记自然地融入真实环境纹理中，从而在不破坏美观的情况下实现6自由度定位跟踪。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

### [3] [Robust Driving QA through Metadata-Grounded Context and Task-Specific Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19001)
*Seungjun Yu,Junsung Park,Youngsun Lim,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过两阶段提示与场景元数据融合，显著提升预训练视觉语言模型在无人驾驶高层问答任务的准确性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过提示设计和外部上下文（历史帧与场景元数据）将通用预训练视觉语言模型用于无人驾驶场景中的高层次问题回答，提高模型在感知、预测与规划决策相关问答的可靠性与鲁棒性。

Method: Phase-1：将Qwen2.5-VL-32B输入六路高清视角、短时序历史帧，并采用chain-of-thought的few-shot示例提示与自洽（self-consistency）多条推理链采样以增强答案稳健性。Phase-2：在提示中加入nuScenes的场景元数据（目标注释、车体状态等）及针对任务类别的专用提示（感知/预测/规划分开），以进一步提升答题准确率。

Result: 在驾驶问答基准上显著优于基线Qwen2.5系列：Phase-1使用5帧历史与10-shot提示获得65.1%总体准确率（零-shot为62.61%），自洽提升到66.85%；Phase-2达67.37%；在严重视觉损坏下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 本文提出的两阶段视觉-语言问答系统，通过对多模态大模型的精心提示工程与上下文增强，在无人驾驶高层任务（感知、预测、规划）问答上取得了明显性能提升。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

### [4] [$Δ$t-Mamba3D: A Time-Aware Spatio-Temporal State-Space Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19003)
*Zhengbo Zhou,Dooman Arefan,Margarita Zuley,Shandong Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合连续时间编码与多尺度3D融合的线性复杂度状态空间模型，专为不规则纵向医学影像设计，在乳腺癌风险预测上显著优于多种基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法无法同时高效地利用高分辨率影像的空间信息与不规则时间序列的时间信息；一些方法将空间信息压缩导致信息损失，或使用昂贵的时空模型难以适应非均匀时间步长。

Method: 提出Time-Aware Δt-Mamba3D，包含（1）连续时间选择性扫描机制，在状态转移中显式编码真实时间差；（2）多尺度3D邻域融合模块用于捕捉空间-时间关系；采用线性复杂度设计以支持长序列。

Result: 在序列筛查乳腺X线照片的风险预测基准上，验证集c-index提升2-5个百分点，1-5年AUC也优于基于RNN、Transformer和其他状态空间模型的变体；模型能高效处理长且不规则的检查历史。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种用于纵向医学影像分析的连续时间状态空间模型，能处理不规则时间间隔并保持计算效率，在乳腺癌风险预测任务上优于多种基线方法。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

### [5] [MoAlign: Motion-Centric Representation Alignment for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19022)
*Aritra Bhowmik,Denis Korzhenkov,Cees G. M. Snoek,Amirhossein Habibian,Mohsen Ghafoorian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 学习一个受光流监督的可解耦运动子空间，并将扩散模型特征对齐到该子空间，以提升文本到视频生成的运动合理性和物理常识性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型在生成高质量视频方面已取得进展，但常常在时间一致性和物理合理性上失败，原因是对复杂运动的理解不足。已有工作尝试将扩散模型与预训练视频编码器对齐，但这些编码器的特征将外观与动态混合在一起，限制了对运动知识传递的效果。因此需要显式提取并对齐纯运动表征。

Method: 从预训练视频编码器提取特征，学习一个可解耦的运动子空间（通过线性或低维投影等方式），并用真实光流作为监督信号优化该子空间以捕捉纯运动信息。随后将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征对齐到该运动子空间，使生成模型内化运动知识以生成更连贯、物理上合理的动作。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench、VBench-2.0）以及用户研究中，所提出的方法在物理常识性评价和运动合理性上均优于基线，同时在与文本提示一致性方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出一种以运动为中心的对齐框架，通过从预训练视频编码器中学习可解耦的运动子空间，并监督该子空间预测光流，从而使文本到视频扩散模型获得更准确的运动知识。实验表明，该方法提升了生成视频的物理常识与运动合理性，同时保持对文本提示的遵循。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

### [6] [PoSh: Using Scene Graphs To Guide LLMs-as-a-Judge For Detailed Image Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19060)
*Amith Ananthram,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Lorena A. Bradford,Julia Demarest,Adam Purvis,Keith Krut,Robert Stein,Rina Elster Pantalony,Mohit Bansal,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoSh使用场景图辅助的LLM评判器为长图片描述提供细粒度、可解释评估；DOCENT为艺术品描述提供新基准；PoSh在相关性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法，并可作为有效奖励信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评价指标为短文本设计，难以捕捉长描述中的属性和关系附着错误，且不能将错误局部化到文本片段；需要可解释、可复现且与人类评分一致的细粒度指标。

Method: 提出PoSh指标：用场景图引导LLM-as-a-Judge，对生成描述在细粒度错误上进行定位并生成聚合分数；并构建DOCENT数据集（艺术品+专家参考+模型描述+学生评判）用于验证；在CapArena上测试鲁棒性；将PoSh用于作为奖励函数进行微调。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT上与人类判断的Spearman
ρ较最佳开源替代方法提高约0.05，优于包括GPT4o-as-a-Judge；在CapArena上表现鲁棒；作为奖励函数优于标准监督微调；并揭示基础模型在复杂场景描述上的不足。

Conclusion: PoSh通过使用场景图作为结构化评分标准并结合LLM作为评判器，实现对图像长文本描述的细粒度评估，能更好地捕捉属性和关系错误，且可重复、可解释。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

### [7] [UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078)
*Zhongyu Jiang,Wenhao Chai,Lei Li,Zhuoran Zhou,Cheng-Yen Yang,Jenq-Neng Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniHPR aligns image, 2D, and 3D human pose embeddings via a novel singular value-based contrastive loss, improving 2D/3D pose estimation and retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited research on correlating diverse human pose representations (images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons) using contrastive learning to obtain unified embeddings for downstream HPE and retrieval.

Method: Introduce UniHPR aligning image, 2D, 3D pose embeddings; propose singular value-based contrastive learning loss for multi-modal alignment; evaluate via simple 3D pose decoder and retrieval tasks.

Result: Achieved MPJPE 49.9mm on Human3.6M, PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on 3DPW cross-domain; retrieval MPJPE 9.24mm on Human3.6M.

Conclusion: The paper presents UniHPR, a unified human pose representation learning pipeline that aligns embeddings from images, 2D and 3D poses using a novel singular value-based contrastive loss, leading to improved 2D/3D HPE and retrieval.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

TL;DR: 作者发布了大型跨自我视角CS2数据集X-Ego-CS并提出CECL对比学习方法，通过对齐队友第一视角视频流提高战术位置推断，验证了方法有效性并开放资源，推动多智能体与人机协作研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体育/电竞交互建模多依赖第三视角（广播视角），忽视了多智能体学习中同步第一视角的时空信息与个体对队友意图的推断能力。作者希望用跨自我视角数据和对比学习改善个体对团队战术的理解。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了X-Ego-CS数据集和CECL方法，用于提高从单一第一视角推测队友与对手位置的能力，推动跨自我视角的多智能体建模。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

Furthermore, FootFormer achieves SOTA performance in estimating
stability-predictive components (CoP, CoM, BoS) used in classic kinesiology
metrics. Code and data are available at

years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

Conclusion: PruneHal能显著减少MLLMs的幻觉问题，通过自适应KV缓存剪枝聚焦关键视觉令牌，实现训练零成本、推理开销近乎为零的高效方法。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

*Takehiro Aoshima,Yusuke Shinohara,Park Byeongseon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VCD，在特征频域度量视频时间一致性，并用作奖励进行微调，显著改善I2V生成的时间一致性而不牺牲其他指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励函数侧重于整体视频质量（如美学、一致性），但对图像到视频(I2V)任务的时间一致性支持不足，导致生成视频的时间连贯性下降。需要一种专门度量和优化时间一致性的指标。

Method: 在奖励式微调框架中，将VCD作为奖励函数进行优化。VCD在视频帧特征的频率空间定义，利用频域分析捕获帧间信息，指导模型生成与参考图像在时间维度上更一致的视频。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上实验表明，使用VCD进行奖励式微调能显著提升时间一致性，同时不降低其他性能，相比此前方法有明显优势。

Conclusion: 提出了Video Consistency Distance (VCD)，在频域度量视频帧特征以提升基于图像的图像到视频生成的时间一致性，通过奖励式微调显著改善时间一致性而不损害其他指标。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: 提出Dream4Drive框架与DriveObj3D数据集，通过3D感知引导图与资产渲染生成多视角合成视频，显著提升自动驾驶角落案例感知性能；并讨论了合成数据与训练轮次之间的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型研究侧重于生成质量与可控性评估，忽略了对下游感知任务的影响；此外，常见预训练-微调策略导致训练轮次翻倍，若仅增加真实数据训练轮次会削弱合成数据的相对优势。为此，作者提出了用于增强下游感知的合成数据生成方法，并提供高质量3D资产库以支持多样化编辑。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

TL;DR: 提出首个将Mixture-of-Experts引入动态高斯溅射的框架MoE-GS，使用体素感知像素路由器自适应融合专家，结合效率优化与蒸馏，在N3V和Technicolor上取得更好质量与更高效率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法在不同场景间表现不一致，单一方法难以兼顾多样动态挑战，因此通过专家混合以适配多种场景特性。

Method: 提出Volume-aware Pixel Router将高斯体积权重差分投影到像素空间，以自适应融合多专家输出；同时通过单次多专家渲染、门控感知高斯剪枝提升效率，并用蒸馏把MoE性能迁移到单一专家以便轻量部署。

Result: 在N3V和Technicolor数据集上，MoE-GS在渲染质量上优于现有方法，并在效率优化手段和蒸馏后实现了更高FPS与轻量化部署。

Conclusion: MoE-GS通过引入Mixture-of-Experts和体素感知像素路由器，有效提升了动态3D高斯溅射的重建质量，兼顾了渲染效果与部署效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D成像雷达点云稀疏且分辨率低，限制了几何表征与多模态融合效果。通过显式表面拟合来增强空间表示和跨模态交互，可以获得更可靠的稠密深度以改善视觉与雷达融合。

Method: 该方法从图像和雷达数据估计二次曲面参数，生成细粒度深度用于（1）图像分支的PV到BEV的特征变换与融合（2）基于表面的伪点云生成以缓解雷达点稀疏性；同时保留原始雷达点云的柱状编码分支，最终在BEV上用2D骨干与检测头预测目标。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合增强摄像头与4D成像雷达的多模态融合，能显著提升稠密深度预测和BEV映射，从而改善目标检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar
backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance
high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at
the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose
a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.
Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.

*Yuheng Wu,Xiangbo Gao,Quang Tau,Zhengzhong Tu,Dongman Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FadeLead encodes background context into compact foreground features via curricular learning, enabling effective collaborative perception under limited bandwidth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bandwidth limits prevent transmitting full feature maps; prior foreground-only approaches discard background context which is valuable. The motivation is to keep benefits of foreground-centric transmission while preserving background context.

Method: The method uses a foreground-centric transmission scheme and a curricular training process that initially uses background cues and progressively prunes them, compelling the model to encode context into foreground features without sending background features at inference.

Result: FadeLead outperforms prior methods on simulated and real-world benchmarks across different bandwidth settings, showing better performance when sharing context-enriched foreground features.

Conclusion: This paper proposes FadeLead, a framework that retains background context within compact foreground features using a curricular learning strategy, improving collaborative perception under bandwidth limits.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FadeLead
outperforms prior methods under different bandwidth settings, underscoring the
effectiveness of context-enriched foreground sharing.

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Conclusion: 本文提出将ControlNet引入单步扩散模型，通过语义边缘引导在单次推理中提供结构约束，从而缓解蒸馏伪影导致的结构不准确问题。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Conclusion: 本文提出的MobiAct在轻量级和高效性方面表现出色，能够在资源受限的MAV平台上实现较高的动作识别精度与快速推理。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

TL;DR: D2D将非可微检测器转换为可微批评器，通过自定义激活将检测器logit做软二值化，在推理时用于优化噪声先验，从而显著提升扩散模型按提示生成正确数量对象的能力，且几乎不损失图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I扩散模型在语义对齐性上表现良好，但常常无法按提示生成正确数量的对象。此前方法多用回归型计数网络作为可微监督，但性能受限；检测器基于枚举的计数能力更强却因不可微被排除。论文旨在将检测器优势引入可微优化，以提高计数能力。

Method: 通过设计自定义激活函数，将检测器的logit转为软二值指示（soft binary indicators），从而使检测器输出可微；在推理阶段使用这些可微信号来优化噪声先验，指导预训练文本到图像扩散模型生成正确数量的对象。

Result: 在SDXL-Turbo、SD-Turbo和Pixart-DMD等模型上，跨低密度、高密度与多目标四个基准，D2D带来一致且显著的计数准确性提升，如在D2D-Small（400提示，低密度）上最高提升13.7%，同时对图像整体质量和计算开销影响较小。

Conclusion: 该论文提出D2D框架，将非可微检测器转为可微“批评器”，用于在推理时对扩散模型的噪声先验进行优化，以提升生成图像的计数准确性。实验表明在多种模型和基准上均有显著提升，且对图像质量和计算开销影响较小。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled

privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
in early Alzheimer disease detection.

Abstract: Mistake analysis in procedural activities is a critical area of research with
applications spanning industrial automation, physical rehabilitation, education
and human-robot collaboration. This paper reviews vision-based methods for
detecting and predicting mistakes in structured tasks, focusing on procedural
and executional errors. By leveraging advancements in computer vision,
including action recognition, anticipation and activity understanding,
vision-based systems can identify deviations in task execution, such as
incorrect sequencing, use of improper techniques, or timing errors. We explore
the challenges posed by intra-class variability, viewpoint differences and
compositional activity structures, which complicate mistake detection.
Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing datasets,
evaluation metrics and state-of-the-art methods, categorizing approaches based
on their use of procedural structure, supervision levels and learning
strategies. Open challenges, such as distinguishing permissible variations from
true mistakes and modeling error propagation are discussed alongside future
directions, including neuro-symbolic reasoning and counterfactual state
modeling. This work aims to establish a unified perspective on vision-based
mistake analysis in procedural activities, highlighting its potential to
enhance safety, efficiency and task performance across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合强化学习和模仿学习的高效训练算法，显著提升轻量级视觉语言模型性能，实现在资源受限环境下的竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然性能优异，但规模庞大，难以应用于资源受限环境，迫切需要一种高效训练方法来开发性能强劲且轻量化的VLM。

Method: 结合强化学习与对抗模仿学习，采用基于大型语言模型的判别器区分学生模型与教师模型输出，并利用多个大规模教师模型提供多样化指导，实现高效训练轻量级学生模型。

Result: RIL训练的轻量级VLM在多种视觉语言任务上表现出显著提升，缩小了与最先进模型间的性能差距，有时甚至实现超越。

Conclusion: 提出的统一强化与模仿学习(RIL)算法显著提升了轻量级视觉语言模型(VLM)的性能，使其在多个基准测试中接近甚至超越当前高性能闭源与开源模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

*Hai-jie Yuan,Heng Zhang,Fei Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TS-GATR：图注意力+GRU的时空签名验证模型，利用双图注意力捕捉局部/全局空间特征并借助GRU建模时间依赖，在MSDS和DeepSignDB上显著降低EER。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决签名内部变异性大和伪造风险高的问题，需要同时捕捉签名的空间关系与时间动态特征。

Method: 将签名表示为图结构（节点包含位置、速度、压力等动态特征），引入Dual-Graph Attention Transformer（DGATR）模块，使用k步和k近邻邻接图分别捕捉局部与全局空间特征，并在时间维度上集成GRU以建模长时依赖。

Result: 在MSDS和DeepSignDB基准数据集上的实验表明，TS-GATR在多种场景中均优于现有方法，在相应评估中取得更低的EER。

Conclusion: TS-GATR在动态签名验证任务中通过结合图注意力网络和GRU，有效建模了时空依赖，提升了验证性能。

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

*Panagiotis Agrafiotis,Begüm Demir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一种联合测深与像素级海床分类的多任务框架，通过跨任务注意力融合和动态权重策略，显著超越现有方法，提供用于浅水一体化制图的开源解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 浅水区域亟需高精度、细致且持续更新的测深与语义信息，但现有方法通常单任务处理深度或海床类型，未能利用任务间互补信息，限制了深度学习方法的应用。

Method: 采用双分支编码器分别处理水深估计与海床分类，利用Attention Feature Fusion模块与windowed Swin-Transformer融合块跨任务交互特征，并通过动态任务不确定性加权平衡损失。

Result: 在两个异质近海站点的大量评估中，Seabed-Net相比传统经验模型和经典机器学习回归方法，最高将RMSE降低75%；相比最先进单任务与多任务基线，测深RMSE下降10-30%，海床分类准确率提升至8%；同时在空间一致性、栖息地边界和低对比区域深度偏差上有明显改善。

Conclusion: Seabed-Net通过联合预测水深与像素级海床分类，显著提升浅水区制图精度与语义一致性，展示出多任务协同带来的综合优势。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Conclusion: 本文指出头部尺度分布（scale shift）在域泛化的拥挤人群定位中造成显著性能下降，并提出了专门针对尺度偏移的研究范式“Scale Shift Domain Generalization”。通过系统实验、基准构建、理论分析和新算法Catto，作者验证了尺度偏移的严重性、现有算法的局限性，并提供了改善方法与未来研究方向。

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP通过功能分层引导的多层CLIP特征融合，避免VAE通路，在减少参数的同时保持或提升语义与细节重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法常仅映射到CLIP最终语义层或引入参数密集的VAE路径以恢复细节，忽视CLIP中间层富含的目标/视觉信息且与大脑功能分层不一致。

Method: 提出将fMRI来自不同视觉区域（低/高级）分别对齐到CLIP的中间层与最终语义层，采用参数高效的多层融合模块；引入Cross-Reconstruction策略和多粒度损失以促进对齐与细节重建，无需额外VAE路径。

Result: 在多项重建与语义评估指标上表现竞争力，尤其在高层语义指标上与或优于使用VAE的SOTA方法，同时参数量减少约71.7%。

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP在不引入VAE通路的情况下，通过多层融合并遵循视觉功能分层，实现了高效且参数节约的fMRI到图像解码，在高层语义指标上达到或超过SOTA，同时保留了细节信息。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

*Ying Dai,Wei Yu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个训练-free的两阶段方法：用EfficientNetB0+SVD+层次聚类完成无监督分割，再用CLIP（ViT）进行分段级开放词汇识别，通过SVD对齐图文嵌入，在多数据集上达到了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不进行监督训练或微调的条件下，实现对开放词汇的图像分割与识别，提升方法的灵活性与泛化能力，同时避免昂贵的数据标注与训练成本。

Method: 两阶段流程：1) 使用EfficientNetB0提取像素级特征，利用奇异值分解(SVD)得到潜在表示，并通过层次聚类进行语义区域分割，聚类数由奇异值分布自适应确定；2) 对分割区域用CLIP的Vision Transformer编码为图像嵌入，预先计算文本嵌入（包含"something else"提示），将图像与文本嵌入串联并通过SVD投影到共享特征空间，最后基于相似度的softmax进行识别。

Result: 在COCO、ADE20K、PASCAL VOC等基准上取得了Hungarian mIoU、精确率、召回率和F1分数的SOTA表现，表明所提框架在无训练条件下也能有效进行开放词汇分割与识别。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种无训练(open-vocabulary)的图像分割与识别框架，通过结合EfficientNetB0的无监督分割与CLIP的视觉-语言对齐实现分段级别的开放词汇识别。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在移动手机代理（MPA）场景需同时处理多任务，但现有多任务SFT难以确定最佳训练数据组合，导致性能受限。

Conclusion: 该论文提出DaMo，通过可训练网络预测不同训练数据比例下的下游任务表现，从而优化多任务混合数据，提升多模态大模型在手机代理任务上的泛化和性能。

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask
learning, existing approaches struggle to determine optimal training data
compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: DARE用梯度范数驱动的自适应弹性正则化和Jacobian折叠惩罚，平衡稳定性与灵活性，减少非物理解，提高配准质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习配准方法常忽视正则化的动态调整，导致过平滑或出现不可逆/非物理解，需一种能在不同区域自适应调节的正则化策略。

Method: 在损失中引入基于形变场梯度范数的自适应权重，结合应变能和剪切能两项弹性能量，并对Jacobian负值区域加惩罚以防止折叠。

Result: 通过自适应调节，DARE在保留细节和减少折叠方面表现更好，提升配准精度与解剖学合理性（实验显示比固定正则化方法更优）。

Conclusion: DARE提出了一种基于梯度范数自适应调节弹性正则化的可变形配准框架，能在保持稳定性的同时提高灵活性，避免折叠并提升解剖学可信度。

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

TL;DR: AegisRF通过扰动场和敏感度场在不显著降低渲染质量的情况下向NeRF注入对抗扰动，从而实现对未经授权下游应用的有效防护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护NeRF模型的知识产权，防止未经授权的下游使用，但直接扰动几何会显著破坏渲染质量，故需要一种既能干扰下游又能保持视觉保真度的方法。

Method: 构建可学习的扰动场用于在渲染前输出（颜色和体密度）中注入对抗扰动，同时学习敏感度场以衡量空间上几何扰动对渲染质量的影响，并据此自适应约束几何扰动。

Result: 实验表明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态（如多视角图像分类和基于体素的3D定位）上具有良好泛化性，并在维持高视觉保真度的同时有效破坏未经授权使用。

Conclusion: 本文提出了AegisRF，通过引入扰动场和敏感度场在保持渲染质量的同时对NeRF模型进行IP保护，实现对未经授权下游任务的干扰。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多摄像头已广泛用于机器人平台，现有VLM多聚焦单视角评估，其多视角信息整合能力和多视角机器人推理能力缺乏系统研究。为填补该空白，设计专门评估多视角空间推理能力的机器人任务基准。

Method: 提出了MV-RoboBench数据集和基准，其中包含1700个经过人工策划的问答项目，覆盖八个子任务，分为空间理解和机器人执行两大类。利用该基准对多种开源及闭源VLM进行评测，包括采用链式思维技术增强的模型。

Result: 评测结果显示，无论开源或闭源模型，现有技术在MV-RoboBench上的表现均显著低于人类水平，同时揭示空间智能与机器人执行能力的正相关关系以及单视角空间理解表现不能可靠预测机器人多视角任务表现。

Conclusion: 当前最先进的多模态视觉-语言模型（VLM）在多视角机器人空间认知任务中的表现仍远低于人类，揭示了其在多视角机器人感知方面面临的重大挑战。空间智能与机器人任务执行之间存在正相关，但单视角空间理解能力不一定能迁移到机器人多视角任务中。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将强大的多模态大模型能力扩展到主观且情感细腻的心理分析领域，填补MLLM在临床心理评估应用方面的空白。

Method: 基于多步骤流程：图像分割为单对象/多对象/整体层次表征；针对每层提取心理线索；构建HTP知识库；训练特征提取模块（用强化学习）生成单对象心理画像；融合多层信息由MLLM输出评估。

Result: 实验显示PICK显著增强MLLM在心理分析任务上的表现，并通过情感理解任务验证了其通用性。

Conclusion: PICK框架有效提升了MLLM在心理学绘画分析（HTP测试）中的能力，提供了可解释的多层次分析并具专家级推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 构建真实IC缺陷大规模极度不平衡数据集并提出ReCAME-Net（多专家+区域通道注意力+度量损失+困难挖掘+蒸馏），有效应对类内聚类导致的分类挑战，且优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实IC生产线的AOI数据比公开不平衡数据更极端，且样本既有类特异性也有与域相关的类无关特征，导致现有不平衡学习方法在工业场景表现不佳。需要新的数据集和方法来应对大类内多样性与类间高相似性。

Method: 提出ReCAME-Net：多专家分类器框架，结合区域通道注意力模块、度量学习损失、困难类别挖掘策略和知识蒸馏。并建立IC-Defect-14大规模高度不平衡数据集，突出“类内聚类”特性以评估方法。

Result: 在IC-Defect-14上，ReCAME-Net显著优于现有最先进模型；同时在通用公开数据集上仍保持可比性能，证明方法在特定工业场景与一般场景的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了IC-Defect-14数据集和ReCAME-Net方法，旨在解决真实IC缺陷分类中高度不平衡数据与类内聚类导致的大类内异质性和类间相似性问题。实验显示ReCAME-Net在IC-Defect-14上优于现有方法，并在公开数据集上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种以孔隙率和深度为条件的cGAN，用有限薄片数据生成高代表性、可控孔隙尺度图像，实验证明在孔隙率控制与形态学保真度上均表现良好，显著提高了代表性，适用于地下储层表征和数字岩石物理应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然地质异质性导致从岩心中提取的子图像往往不能代表块体测量值，加上物理样品稀少，使得准确表征孔隙结构成为难题；因此需要一种能在受限数据下生成具有指定宏观属性且保持地质合理性的孔隙图像的方法。

Method: 在单一模型中同时以孔隙率和深度作为条件训练cGAN，训练数据来自同一碳酸盐岩地层四个深度的薄片样本（1879.50-1943.50 m）；通过条件输入捕捉通用孔隙网络特征和深度相关的地质差异，生成图像后对孔径、比表面积、曲折率等形态学指标进行验证。

Result: 模型在孔隙率控制上表现优异（R^2=0.95），平均绝对误差为0.0099-0.0197；关键形态学指标与真实样本统计差异在地质容忍范围内；生成图像在双约束代表性误差上仅为1.9-11.3%，远优于随机提取实样子图的36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出并验证了一个多条件生成对抗网络（cGAN）框架，能够生成在孔隙率和深度上可精确控制且地质上具有代表性的孔隙尺度图像，从而解决了子样本与实测整体性质不一致及样本稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成模型的预测先验MRI重建新范式：先预测目标对比图像再用于欠采样k-space的重建，在大规模多数据集上证明比现有方法有显著性能提升，推动从被动重建到主动预测成像的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决MRI长采集时间限制临床通量的问题，通过利用AI生成能力预测目标对比图像，从而减少对采样数据的依赖并加速成像流程。

Method: 方法包括训练一个生成模型（条件生成网络）以基于其他对比图像、先前扫描、采集参数和病人信息等多源条件预测目标对比图像；随后将该预测图像作为数据驱动先验融入到重建算法中，对欠采样k-space数据进行重建。实验在内部和多个公开数据集上进行，包含多通道k-space，测试加速因子为x4、x8、x12。

Result: 在总计14,921次扫描（1,051,904张切片）的多数据集评测中，预测先验重建方法在各种加速因子下显著优于无先验或其他先验的方法，尤其在高加速（x8、x12）场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了从传统重建向预测性成像的范式转变，通过生成式模型预测目标对比图像并将其作为重建的先验，实现对高加速采样MRI数据的高质量重建。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

Motivation: 现有视频方法仅在序列内建模，未利用跨序列重复运动和结构规律；将姿态估计表述为从已见模式中检索并适配可缓解2D到3D深度模糊性并积累知识。

Method: 建立图记忆库存储姿态原型（关系图），通过注意力检索最相关原型并与输入特征通过记忆驱动图卷积融合，同时采用双流混合架构：Mamba状态空间模型用于局部线性时序建模，Self-attention用于全局关系建模。

Result: 在人类3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上分别达成MPJPE 37.1mm和13.4mm，优于现有方法，并在跨域泛化上表现更强。

Conclusion: PRGCN通过跨序列模式复用改进单目视频3D人体姿态估计，提出图形记忆库与检索适配机制，结合记忆驱动图卷积和解剖约束以保证几何合理性，从而提升精度和泛化能力。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

TL;DR: TL;DR：针对卫星影像的MNAR缺失，论文通过插补与基于覆盖率分箱的加权重采样去偏，成功减小模型对覆盖率的敏感性，提升低覆盖率下甲烷羽检测的鲁棒性与公平性，同时保持总体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是卫星影像因云等因素导致系统性非随机缺失（MNAR），若不处理会导致特征提取模型学习到覆盖率与目标标签的虚假关联，进而在低覆盖率图像中漏检。

Method: 方法包括：1) 评估多种插补方法以消除覆盖率与标签的依赖；2) 提出基于覆盖率分箱的加权重采样训练策略，保证每个覆盖率区间内的类别平衡；3) 在操作场景中评估去偏模型在低覆盖率图像上检测甲烷羽的能力。

Result: 结果显示：插补和加权重采样均能显著降低表示偏差，并在不损害平衡准确率、精确率和召回率的情况下，提高了在低覆盖率图像中检测到甲烷羽的概率。

Conclusion: 论文结论：通过插补（imputation）和加权重采样（weighted resampling）可以减弱由卫星影像缺失像素（MNAR）与标签之间的虚假关联导致的表现偏差，从而提高在低覆盖率图像中甲烷羽检测的公平性与实用性，且不会降低平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

TL;DR: 针对单源域泛化目标检测中模型依赖虚假相关特征的问题，Cauvis用跨注意力视觉提示和双分支高频适配器解纠缠因果/虚假特征，显著提升泛化与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单源域泛化目标检测中，模型在域偏差与有限域信息下容易依赖与任务无关的虚假相关特征（如颜色），导致在未见目标域表现差。作者希望通过因果视角和提示/适配器设计抑制虚假特征，增强域不变表征。

Method: 提出Cross-Attention Prompts模块将视觉提示与跨注意力融合以抑制简化的虚假特征依赖；设计双分支适配器以通过高频特征提取实现因果特征与虚假特征的解纠缠和域适配。

Result: 在SDGOD基准上，Cauvis较现有域泛化方法取得15.9-31.4%的性能提升，并在复杂干扰场景下展现更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Cauvis通过可学习的视觉提示与跨注意力机制、以及双分支适配器实现因果-虚假特征的解纠缠和高频域适配，从而在单源域泛化目标检测任务中显著提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

TL;DR: 提出CARES，一个基于小型VLM的上下文感知分辨率选择器，按图像-查询动态挑选最小充分分辨率，保持性能同时大幅降低计算（最高80%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大VLM为保证广泛任务有效性常使用高分辨率输入，导致视觉tokens占比过高和计算浪费；许多查询在低分辨率下即可得到充分答案，因而需要按查询自适应选择分辨率以节省计算。

Method: 设计一个轻量级前处理模块，使用一个小型VLM（350M）提取图像-查询特征，并判别目标大VLM在不同分辨率下的回答是否已收敛，从而选择最小充分分辨率；训练为离散分类并在推理时支持连续分辨率插值。

Result: 在5个涵盖文档与自然图像的多模态基准及多种目标VLM上，CARES在不降低任务表现的前提下，最多节省80%的计算。

Conclusion: CARES通过在输入图像分辨率上进行语境感知选择，在保留目标VLM性能的同时显著降低计算和延迟。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete
classifier over a set of optional resolutions, CARES interpolates continuous
resolutions at inference for fine-grained control. Across five multimodal
benchmarks spanning documents and natural images, as well as diverse target
VLMs, CARES preserves task performance while reducing compute by up to 80%.

Motivation: 现有方法在图像对重叠很小时或无重叠时表现差；单纯用视频插值会因为输入重叠少而生成模糊帧，且已有的关键帧选择策略计算慢且与位姿估计目标不直接对齐。

Method: 提出Hybrid Video Generation(HVG)：将视频插值模型与基于位姿约束的新视图合成模型耦合，生成更清晰的中间帧；提出Feature Matching Selector(FMS)：基于特征匹配度选择对位姿估计有利的合成中间帧。

Result: 在Cambridge Landmarks、ScanNet、DL3DV-10K和NAVI数据集上大量实验表明，PoseCrafter相较于现有SOTA方法在位姿估计上有明显提升，尤其是在小重叠或无重叠的案例中。

Conclusion: 本文提出的PoseCrafter通过混合视频生成(HVG)与基于特征对应的帧选择(FMS)，显著提升了稀疏重叠或无重叠图像对的相机位姿估计性能，尤其在小重叠/无重叠情形表现优越。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

Motivation: 动机是：尽管VLM在多个下游任务中表现良好，但在视觉推理（关系识别、时间序列理解、计数等）方面仍有明显弱点；需要深入理解失败原因并提出高效的改进策略，而不仅仅依赖打分式基准评估。

Method: 方法包括：在受控条件下系统性评估7个最先进VLM在计数任务的表现，进行层级（layer-wise）表征分析以定位错误源，并设计有针对性的训练策略，仅微调输出层（最后一层）以纠正映射错误，同时在真实世界数据集上进行验证。

Result: 结果显示：VLM 对对象数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物共现高度敏感；层级分析表明错误源于最后一层到输出层的映射；通过仅微调输出层，可在受控实验中将准确率提升最多21%，并在真实场景数据集上取得一致改进。

Conclusion: 论文结论是：VLM 在视觉推理（尤其计数任务）上存在显著缺陷，这些错误主要来自最后一层表示到输出空间的映射错误；仅微调输出层即可显著提升性能（最多提升21%），且在真实数据集上也能获得稳定改进。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管提示工程是与T2I模型交互的主要手段，但关于提示复杂度如何系统性影响合成数据在质量、多样性和一致性三个关键效用维度的影响尚未被充分研究。

Method: 先通过合成实验和理论推导说明在提示复杂度变化下模型泛化的难度；构建了一个可比较真实数据与合成数据效用的新评估框架；在CC12M、ImageNet-1k和DCI等数据集上，评估常用T2I模型与多种推理期介入方法（如提示扩展）对质量、多样性和一致性的影响。

Result: 合成实验及理论表明：从特殊到更一般的条件进行泛化更难；大规模实证显示增加提示复杂度降低条件多样性和提示一致性，但减小合成与真实分布差距；推理期介入方法可提高多样性但可能降低真实性；提示扩展在图像多样性和审美方面优于其他方法，甚至超过真实数据。

Conclusion: 本文研究了提示（prompt）复杂度对文本到图像（T2I）模型合成数据效用的系统性影响，发现提示越复杂，条件多样性和提示一致性越低，但合成与真实分布的差距减小；推理期介入方法能提升多样性但可能使生成样本脱离真实数据支持域，且通过预训练语言模型进行提示扩展在图像多样性和审美上表现最佳。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

### [48] [A Matter of Time: Revealing the Structure of Time in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19559)
*Nidham Tekaya,Manuela Waldner,Matthias Zeppelzauer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM embeddings encode time along a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold; extracting explicit timeline representations enables effective, efficient temporal reasoning on images (tested on TIME10k with 37 VLMs).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether open-vocabulary VLMs are aware of time and can position visual content chronologically, enabling temporal reasoning without task-specific training.

Method: They build TIME10k (10k+ images with temporal ground truth), evaluate 37 VLMs with a novel methodology, analyze embedding geometry to find a low-dimensional nonlinear temporal manifold, and propose timeline extraction methods from embeddings to perform temporal tasks, comparing against a prompt-based baseline.

Result: Temporal information forms a low-dimensional non-linear manifold in embeddings; timeline methods derived from embeddings are computationally efficient and achieve competitive or superior accuracy versus prompt-based baselines.

Conclusion: The paper shows that large-scale VLMs contain structured temporal information in their embedding spaces, which can be extracted as an explicit timeline representation to enable temporal reasoning.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

*Yao Deng,Xian Zhong,Wenxuan Liu,Zhaofei Yu,Jingling Yuan,Tiejun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HAD，通过分层时空对齐的知识蒸馏架构，高效融合RGB与事件数据，显著提升在极端场景下的目标跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB与事件相机在成像机制上存在本质差异，导致在时空信息分布上不对齐，直接融合会丢失重要信息或增加学生模型复杂度，需通过蒸馏与对齐机制弥合差距。

Method: 设计了分层对齐的知识蒸馏方法，显式建模时空不对称性，利用多层次的蒸馏损失将教师（多模态或高容量模型）知识传递给轻量学生网络，兼顾时间分辨率与HDR信息的融合。

Result: 在多组实验中，HAD在各种挑战场景（高速运动、HDR、动态背景）上均优于现有最优方法，并通过消融实验验证了各组件（分层对齐、蒸馏损失等）的必要性与有效性。

Conclusion: 论文提出的Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation (HAD)框架有效缓解了RGB相机与事件相机之间的时空不对称性，通过分层对齐策略在保证学生网络计算与参数紧凑的同时，最小化信息损失，从而提升了目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该工作提出首个通过视频alpha通道实施的no-box对抗攻击α-Cloak，能在无访问模型的情况下隐蔽地干扰检测器，展示视频感知系统中新出现的安全威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着目标检测模型在自动驾驶等实际系统中的部署，检测其在视频域（尤其无box设定）中的对抗脆弱性变得迫切，需要评估潜在威胁并提示防御方向。

Method: 设计并实现了基于alpha通道的融合算法，使融合后的视频对人类无感知伪装但能持续误导目标检测器；系统性研究常见视频格式和播放器对alpha通道的支持以保证兼容性并避免可感知伪影。

Result: 在五种SOTA目标检测器、一个视觉-语言模型和多模态大模型（Gemini-2.0-Flash）上进行评估，声称在所有场景下达到100%攻击成功率，并未引入可感知伪影。

Conclusion: 本文提出了α-Cloak，一种利用RGBA视频中alpha通道进行的no-box对抗攻击，能在不访问模型内部的情况下通过融合恶意目标视频与无害视频，骗过目标检测器。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VGD：通过几何先验蒸馏、Gaussian Head及语义细化分支融合多尺度特征，显著提升环视场景的几何一致性与新视图渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环视视角重建中视角重叠少，现有方法难以同时保证几何一致性与新视图质量，需显式学习并利用几何信息指导语义提升。

Method: 设计轻量化VGGT变体蒸馏几何先验到几何分支；Gaussian Head融合多尺度几何tokens预测高斯参数用于新视图渲染；结合多尺度几何与高斯分支特征监督语义细化模块，进行特征一致性学习。

Result: 在nuScenes上，VGD在多种设置下在客观指标与主观质量上显著优于SOTA方法，证明了其可扩展性与高保真度重建能力。

Conclusion: VGD通过显式学习几何信息并结合Gaussian Head和语义细化分支，有效提升了环视场景重建的几何一致性与新视图质量。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在地球观测领域，多源传感器产生大量异构数据，但实际部署时常因平台或传感器限制只能获取单一模态，迫切需要能在训练时利用多模态数据、推断时仅用单模态的通用方法。

Method: 结合对比学习与模态判别学习，引导单模态模型将模型内部表示划分为模态共享和模态特有信息，从而在训练时融合多模态信号但在推断时仅依赖单模态输入。

Result: 在四个地球观测基准数据集（包括分类与回归任务，且测试时只提供训练时的一种模态）上，方法在预测性能上持续优于近年机器学习、计算机视觉及遥感领域的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个通用的多模态协同学习框架，旨在利用训练阶段的多模态信息来提升仅使用单一模态进行推断时的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

Abstract: This paper investigates methods for estimating uncertainty in semantic
segmentation predictions derived from satellite imagery. Estimating uncertainty
for segmentation presents unique challenges compared to standard image
classification, requiring scalable methods producing per-pixel estimates. While
most research on this topic has focused on scene understanding or medical
imaging, this work benchmarks existing methods specifically for remote sensing
and Earth observation applications. Our evaluation focuses on the practical
utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

Motivation: 利用已训练的多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务上关注相关视觉token的能力，尝试在不额外训练的情况下实现目标定位与分割。

Method: 将视频推理分割视为视频问答，利用注意力回滚提取原始注意力图；提出对比的前景-背景融合和互补的视频-帧融合来抑制噪声并增强对象响应；用注意力引导的SAM2提示生成精细掩码；全程无需对MLLM或SAM重训练。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一个无训练的视频分割方法DecAF，通过从多模态大模型提取注意力图并加以分解融合以得到精准的分割掩码。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只输出单一确定性掩码，难以表达伪造区域的不确定性与多样性；传统高斯扩散不适合二值稀疏掩码分布，需更合适的噪声与时序特征交互机制提升可靠性。

Method: 提出条件伯努利扩散模型（CBDiff），在扩散过程中引入伯努利噪声以符合掩码的二值稀疏特性，并设计Time-Step Cross-Attention(TSCAttention)模块，用语义特征与时间步信息交互引导生成。模型对输入伪造图像条件生成多样化的定位图以表示不确定性。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多样化的伪造掩码样本并采用伯努利噪声建模和时间步交叉注意力，有效提升了图像伪造定位的可靠性与准确性，适用于实际取证场景。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然VLMs在医学影像零样本识别上表现出色，但其文本概念与视觉证据的对齐（grounding）尚未充分评估，而这种对齐对临床可解释性和采纳至关重要。

Method: 对七种基于CLIP的VLM变体在胸部X光影像上进行系统评估，使用交叉注意力与相似度基的定位图生成可视化解释，并与放射科医生标注的病灶区域做量化对齐评估，覆盖多种病变类型。

Result: 发现所有模型对大且边界清晰的病变定位合理，但对小/弥漫性病灶表现显著下降；在胸片特定数据上预训练的模型对齐性更好；整体识别能力与对齐能力高度相关；当前模型距离临床可靠可解释仍有差距。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在胸片定位能力上尚不足以临床可靠解释，尤其对小型或弥漫性病灶表现较差；针对胸片预训练的模型在对齐性上优于通用域训练模型；识别能力与定位能力高度相关，需在部署前进行专门的可解释性基准评估。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一种基于小波散射系数且对其子集ℓ^1范数进行联合极小/极大化的去噪方法，理论上关联散射系数与几何规则性，数值上在卡通图像（α≤2）达到minimax界限，并将该现象提出为猜想，连接了谐波分析与卷积网络的去噪理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于帧的稀疏阈值或ℓ^1最小化方法在处理具有复杂几何结构（例如边界为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像）时，当Lipschitz指数α≤2且未知时表现次优；而深度卷积神经网络能在数值上达到更好（minimax）结果。小波散射作为CNN的简化解析模型能保留多尺度几何信息，因而被用于构造更适应复杂规则性的去噪方法。

Method: 引入基于小波散射系数的去噪估计器：先计算小波系数的模，然后对模再进行小波变换获得散射系数；构造一个目标函数，对不同子集的散射系数的ℓ^1范数进行联合极小化与极大化以生成估计器；证明这些ℓ^1范数能刻画不同的几何规律性；并通过数值实验验证在卡通图像上达到minimax界限（将数值事实提出为猜想）。

Result: 理论上证明不同子集的散射系数的ℓ^1范数对应不同类型的几何规则性；数值实验表明所提估计器在卡通图像的去噪任务上对所有α≤2达到minimax渐近界，作者将此数值事实提出为数学猜想。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过对不同子集的散射系数的ℓ^1范数进行联合极小和极大化，能够刻画图像的多种几何规则性，并数值上在所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像上达到最小化极限界（minimax）界限，作者将该数值结果陈述为一个数学猜想。这为结合谐波分析与深度卷积网络的去噪提供了新的途径。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

<details>

Motivation: 异构智能体因传感器与模型差异在协作中产生域间差距。现有适配或重建方法需侵入性重训练或在接入新代理时计算代价高，不利于实际部署与扩展。

Method: 设计Deformable Message Extractor提取可变形空间消息，利用条件扩散模型（Spatial-Aware Feature Generator）在自我语义空间生成对齐特征，随后用Channel Enhancer精炼特征并融合。采用数值轻量对齐以降低新增代理开销。

Result: 在OPV2V-H、DAIR-V2X和V2X-Real数据集上，GenComm优于现有方法，并在接入新代理时实现约81%的计算与参数开销降低。

Conclusion: 本文提出的GenComm通过生成替代特征和轻量化空间对齐实现异构多智能体协作感知，无需改动原有网络并能低成本接入新代理，从而缓解域间差异。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

*Zhengxuan Wei,Jiajin Tang,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMR利用零外部依赖的数据增强与冷启动+蒸馏两阶段训练，通过双查询与跨阶段一致性，解决了注释稀缺、边界模糊和语义混淆，显著提升时刻检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于数据稀缺导致的浅层关键词关联、事件相邻区间的边界歧义以及细粒度语义区分能力不足。

Method: 提出Augmented Moment Retrieval (AMR)框架；采用基于增强数据的cold-start阶段（课程学习）建立边界/语义基础感知；随后distillation适配阶段引入双查询（冻结的Base/Original Queries与可训练的Active Queries），并用跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，AMR在定位精度和语义辨识能力上优于先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: AMR通过零外部依赖的数据增强与两阶段训练，有效缓解注释稀缺、边界模糊和语义细粒度辨别问题，从而提升时刻检索性能。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CT-RATE-VQA数据集与MedReason-R1模型：通过zoom-in ROI和GRPO强化学习实现可解释的逐步诊断推理，在CT疾病诊断上达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用VLM在医疗影像诊断任务上表现不足，原因包括缺乏大规模高质量医学影像数据集以及忽视从粗到细的诊断推理过程。

Method: 构建大型CT问答数据集（CT-RATE-VQA，84K问答对）；在模型中嵌入zoom-in病灶ROI信息以突出局部细节与全局定位；引入GRPO强化学习框架进行无监督/弱监督的推理训练。

Result: 在CT疾病诊断任务上，MedReason-R1相较近期通用及医学VLM取得了SOTA性能，同时保持良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: MedReason-R1通过引入逐步细化的诊断流程与局部放大病灶区域的策略，并结合GRPO强化学习，实现了CT疾病诊断上的最佳表现，同时兼顾了泛化能力。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,
checkpoints, and dataset are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的稠密化和自适应重激活策略，解决了3D-GS的稠密化梯度稀释与基元冻结问题，从而在复杂场景中显著提升重建质量并有良好泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D-GS在复杂场景中出现局部模糊和针状畸变，原因不仅是大尺度高斯核未充分分裂，还包括稠密化过程中的梯度幅值稀释和基元“冻结”现象导致的优化停滞。

Method: 提出重要性感知的稠密化判据（引入多视点的α混合权重）用于在复杂区域重新激活停滞的基元增长，并通过自适应参数扰动对冻结基元进行重激活。

Result: 在多种真实数据集上，ReAct-GS消除了过度重建伪影，在标准新视图合成指标上达到SOTA，并在与Pixel-GS等变体结合时也带来一致性提升。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS通过重激活机制有效缓解了3D-GS在复杂场景中的过度重建伪影问题，使得在保持几何细节的同时达到或超过现有方法的视图合成性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Policy World Model，将世界建模与规划合一，通过无动作未来状态预测与协同预测机制提升规划；并以动态并行token生成优化视频预测，在单前摄输入下达成SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界模型多用于模拟而非直接服务于轨迹规划，且解耦学习与规划。目标是探索世界模型如何更好地促进规划性能，并实现统一框架下的联动。

Method: 在统一架构中结合世界建模与规划，引入action-free未来状态预测方案，实施协同状态-动作预测；为高效视频预测设计动态增强并行token生成机制，包括上下文引导tokenizer和自适应动态聚焦损失。

Result: 在仅使用前摄像头输入的条件下，PWM达到或超过依赖多视角多模态输入的最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: PWM提出将世界建模与轨迹规划统一，利用无动作的未来状态预测提升规划性能，并通过协同状态-动作预测模拟人类预判，提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者把认知心理学的视觉搜索范式应用于MLLMs，发现其在单特征搜索中有类人“弹出”效应、在多特征搜索中有容量限制，并利用光照等场景先验，且通过微调和可解释性分析得到验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对MLLMs的视觉处理主要依赖黑盒任务精度评估，难以揭示模型的内部感知机制；因此作者采用人类视觉研究中的范式来诊断模型是否具有类人感知特性。

Method: 借鉴认知心理学中的经典视觉搜索范式，设计控制实验以测试颜色、大小和光照特征的弹出效应，并通过针对性微调和机械可解释性分析加强结论。

Result: 发现先进MLLMs在颜色或大小的单特征搜索中表现出弹出效应，在多特征组合搜索中存在容量限制，并且模型似乎利用了自然场景先验（如光照方向）来表征物体；微调和可解释性分析支持这些发现。

Conclusion: 本文证明大型多模态语言模型(MLLMs)在视觉搜索任务中展现出与人类类似的感知特征，包括对单一显著特征的“弹出(pop-out)”效应和对多特征组合的容量限制。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出CST，通过曲线提取与拓扑监督将结构一致性融入无配对翻译，显著保留医学图像中的细长曲线结构并提升多模态翻译效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无配对图像翻译方法常破坏微小曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断和量化分析，尤其在眼科和血管成像中问题严重，需一种能显式保留此类结构的通用框架。

Method: 在基线无配对翻译模型（如CycleGAN和UNSB）中引入曲线结构提取模块，通过拓扑监督将结构一致性纳入训练策略，从而在生成过程中强制保持细长曲线的几何拓扑特征。

Result: 在OCTA、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影三种模态上，CST增强后的模型在结构保留和翻译保真度方面优于基线并达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: CST能显著改善无配对图像翻译中细长曲线结构的保留，从而提高翻译保真度并在多模态医学成像上取得最先进的结果。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习PAD模型通常为黑盒，缺乏可解释性；可视化解释可以帮助理解模型依据哪些图像区域做出真假判定，从而提升系统安全性和可信度。

Method: 通过集成多种CAM（Class Activation Map）方法生成更稳定、可靠的可视化热图，突出模型判定真假人脸图像时的重要区域；在已有的DL-based人脸PAD模型上对生成的解释进行验证和比较分析。

Result: Ensemble-CAM为DL人脸PAD系统提供了更清晰和一致的可视化解释，有助于揭示模型关注的关键区域，增强对模型行为的理解；预计可提升透明性并帮助发现模型弱点。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Ensemble-CAM，一种用于深度学习人脸展示攻击检测（PAD）系统的可视化解释方法，旨在提高模型决策的透明性和可信度。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 LyTimeT：TimeSformer 自编码器提取鲁棒潜变量，线性相关筛选物理维度，Lyapunov 稳定化转移，取得更可解释且稳定的长时预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维视频含有背景运动、遮挡、纹理变化等干扰，直接学习动力学变量困难，需有鲁棒且稳定的潜变量表示以实现可解释且长时稳定的预测。

Method: 两阶段方法：阶段1 用基于 TimeSformer 的时空自编码器通过全局注意力聚焦动态相关区域以抑制干扰并实现长期视频预测；阶段2 在学习到的潜变量空间中通过线性相关性分析选取有物理意义的维度，并用基于 Lyapunov 的稳定正则项精化状态转移以强制收缩性，减少滚动预测误差累积。

Result: 在五个合成基准和四个真实世界动力学系统（含混沌）上，LyTimeT 在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，并在分析均方误差上优于基于 CNN 的 TIDE 和仅 Transformer 的基线。

Conclusion: LyTimeT 能有效从高维视频中提取与动力学相关的可解释变量，并在预测精度与物理可解释性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

TL;DR: ADQ通过分位数初始化、EMA在线自适应codebook与感度驱动混合精度，加上激活的非均匀到均匀映射，改善了量化性能，尤其在低比特混合精度设置下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT方法难以应对激活高度非均匀分布和静态不匹配的权重codebook，导致低比特量化性能下降，因此需要一个能动态适应分布并结合混合精度分配的方案。

Method: 提出一种混合精度量化框架，包括：基于分位数的codebook初始化、基于EMA的在线codebook自适应以及感度驱动的混合精度分配；对激活采用非均匀到均匀的映射以兼顾性能与硬件友好性。

Result: 在ImageNet上，ResNet-18在平均2.81位下实现71.512% Top-1精度，优于同条件下的最先进方法；在CIFAR-10上消融研究验证各组件的独立贡献。

Conclusion: ADQ通过自适应、分布感知的权重量化和硬件友好的激活映射，有效减小了量化误差，提高了低比特率下的性能，实验表明在ImageNet和CIFAR-10上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了OmniMotion-X，一个统一的多模态全身动作生成框架，通过自回归扩散变换器实现序列到序列建模，支持文本、音乐、语音等多种条件输入及空间-时间控制任务。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法在长尾分布下会导致原型退化，以及在语义相近类别间易混淆，进而影响VLMs在部署分布偏移下的表现。

Method: 引入了‘类感知原型缓存模块’动态按测试时类别频次与激活历史调整每类容量，并对长时间未激活类别进行重振；同时采用‘负对比学习机制’识别并约束难负样本以增强类别可分性。优化采用不对称策略，只微调文本端原型，视觉特征保持固定。

Conclusion: 本文提出了CPL-NC，一种针对视觉-语言模型（VLMs）的轻量级测试时自适应（TTA）方法，通过类别感知原型缓存与负对比约束提升分布偏移下的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

*Siyang Wu,Jack Nugent,Willow Yang,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 现有单目深度评估指标对平面曲率扰动不敏感，作者提出基于相对表面法线的新指标、可视化工具和复合指标方法以更好对齐人类判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管单目深度估计取得进展，但评价标准缺乏统一且现有大量指标在判断质量时表现差异大；需要理解这些指标的行为及其与人类感知的一致性，从而设计更可靠的评价方法。

Method: 对现有评估指标进行量化分析：通过对地真值施加多种扰动（深度偏移、尺度、噪声、曲率等），衡量各指标对扰动的敏感性并比较与人类主观评价的相关性；提出基于相对表面法线的度量以及生成复合指标的原则方法，并提供可视化工具帮助分析。

Result: 发现多数常用指标对曲率扰动非常不敏感，提出的相对表面法线指标能更好捕捉曲率变化；所设计的复合指标在人类主观判断上的对齐度提高，同时提供工具与数据供社区使用。

Conclusion: 本文指出现有单目深度评估指标在对曲率扰动（如将平面变为波浪）特别不敏感，提出基于相对表面法线的新指标并引入新可视化工具与组合指标方法，以更好对齐人类判断。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data
are available at: https://github.com/princeton-vl/evalmde.

### [74] [olmOCR 2: Unit Test Rewards for Document OCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19817)
*Jake Poznanski,Luca Soldaini,Kyle Lo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于RLVR和合成文档单元测试的7B VLM（olmOCR-2），显著提升复杂布局OCR性能并开源成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动且高质量地将复杂版面（数学公式、表格、多栏等）的扫描或PDF文档转换为结构化、自然顺序的纯文本，现有方法在这些复杂元素上表现欠佳，需要更可验证和可扩展的训练目标。

Method: 构建了一个名为olmOCR-2-7B-1025的7B VLM，使用RLVR训练，奖励来自多样的二元单元测试；为规模化单元测试，设计了合成文档生成流水线，产出具有地面真实HTML源码和测试用例的数据集；在这些测试用例上进行RL训练并评估。

Result: 在作者构建的英文OCR基准olmOCR-Bench上取得了最先进表现，尤其在数学公式转换、表格解析和多栏布局方面相比前代模型有最大改进；同时模型、数据和代码以宽松开源许可发布。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了olmOCR 2，通过专门的7B视觉语言模型和使用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）技术，将扫描文档（如PDF）转为有序纯文本，提高了复杂布局元素的识别与重建能力。

Abstract: We present olmOCR 2, the latest in our family of powerful OCR systems for
converting digitized print documents, like PDFs, into clean, naturally ordered
plain text. olmOCR 2 is powered by olmOCR-2-7B-1025, a specialized, 7B vision
language model (VLM) trained using reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR), where our rewards are a diverse set of binary unit tests. To
scale unit test creation, we develop a pipeline for generating synthetic
documents with diverse and challenging layouts, known ground-truth HTML source
code, and extracted test cases. We show that RL training on these test cases
results in state-of-the-art performance on olmOCR-Bench, our English-language
OCR benchmark, with the largest improvements in math formula conversion, table
parsing, and multi-column layouts compared to previous versions. We release our
model, data and code under permissive open licenses.

### [75] [Is This Tracker On? A Benchmark Protocol for Dynamic Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19819)
*Ilona Demler,Saumya Chauhan,Georgia Gkioxari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ITTO is a new, realistic point-tracking benchmark revealing SOTA weaknesses in occlusion and complex motion, guiding future robust algorithm development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks lack real-world motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity, so researchers need a diagnostic suite reflecting these challenges.

Method: Compile videos from existing datasets and egocentric recordings; collect high-quality annotations via a multi-stage human pipeline; evaluate SOTA trackers and analyze performance by motion/occlusion axes.

Result: SOTA trackers perform poorly especially on re-identification after occlusion; analyses reveal critical failure modes tied to motion complexity and occlusion.

Conclusion: ITTO provides a realistic, challenging benchmark showing current point trackers fail on occlusion and complex motion, necessitating new model designs.

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking
algorithms.

*Hamed Jelodar,Samita Bai,Roozbeh Razavi-Far,Ali A. Ghorbani*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出FlexiDataGen，一个结合语法-语义分析、RAG、动态注入与迭代改写的自适应LLM框架，用于在敏感领域合成高质量语义数据，缓解数据与标注瓶颈，促进可扩展且准确的机器学习模型开发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据稀缺、获取成本高、隐私受限的高风险领域（如医疗、生物、网络安全）中，数据可用性与质量严重制约机器学习的发展。

Method: 将四个核心组件结合：语法-语义分析用于理解领域结构和约束；检索增强生成(RAG)用于引入真实知识和背景；动态元素注入通过可控策略插入关键特征或罕见事件；迭代性改写与语义验证用于提高多样性并保证语义一致性。

Result: 实验表明FlexiDataGen生成的数据在语义一致性、多样性和领域相关性方面表现良好，能有效缓解数据短缺并减少人工标注需求，从而提高下游模型的可扩展性与准确性。

Conclusion: FlexiDataGen能够在敏感领域通过自动生成语义一致且语言多样的数据，缓解数据匮乏和标注瓶颈，推动可扩展且准确的机器学习模型开发。

Abstract: Dataset availability and quality remain critical challenges in machine
learning, especially in domains where data are scarce, expensive to acquire, or
constrained by privacy regulations. Fields such as healthcare, biomedical
research, and cybersecurity frequently encounter high data acquisition costs,
limited access to annotated data, and the rarity or sensitivity of key events.
These issues-collectively referred to as the dataset challenge-hinder the
development of accurate and generalizable machine learning models in such
high-stakes domains. To address this, we introduce FlexiDataGen, an adaptive
large language model (LLM) framework designed for dynamic semantic dataset
generation in sensitive domains. FlexiDataGen autonomously synthesizes rich,
semantically coherent, and linguistically diverse datasets tailored to
specialized fields. The framework integrates four core components: (1)
syntactic-semantic analysis, (2) retrieval-augmented generation, (3) dynamic
element injection, and (4) iterative paraphrasing with semantic validation.
Together, these components ensure the generation of high-quality,
domain-relevant data. Experimental results show that FlexiDataGen effectively
alleviates data shortages and annotation bottlenecks, enabling scalable and
accurate machine learning model development.

### [77] [Fine-Grained Dichotomies for Conjunctive Queries with Minimum or Maximum](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19197)
*Nofar Carmeli,Nikolaos Tziavelis*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 论文为按min/max排序的CQ相关任务给出自连接自由情形下的完全二分复杂性分类，提出相应算法与下界证明，界定了哪些查询能在近理想时间内高效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统枚举和直接访问CQ答案通常按无序或简单属性排序处理；当答案按最小/最大属性值排序时，问题结构复杂且实用价值高（如偏序排名、top-k检索），因此需要细粒度复杂性划分以指导算法设计与系统实现。

Method: 作者以min/max排序为核心，发展了结构性工具和复杂性分析框架，分别针对排名枚举、含min谓词的CQ的计数、枚举、按位置直接访问和谓词消除等任务，构造上界算法（近线性预处理+常/对数时间查询）和下界证明，最终对自连接自由CQ建立完整二分法。

Result: 对每个任务（排名枚举、计数、枚举、直接访问、谓词消除）均给出完全二分结果：识别出能够实现（拟）线性预处理加常/对数时间查询的查询类，并为其余情形给出复杂性下界，表明难以在近理想时间内解决。

Conclusion: 本论文对基于最小/最大值排序的连接查询（CQ）答案的按位置直接访问以及相关任务的细粒度复杂性进行了系统研究，给出了自连接自由CQ在各任务上的完全二分图（dichotomy），并精确划分出可在近理想时间内解决的情形。

Abstract: We investigate the fine-grained complexity of direct access to Conjunctive
Query (CQ) answers according to their position, ordered by the minimum (or
maximum) value between attributes. We further use the tools we develop to
explore a wealth of related tasks. We consider the task of ranked enumeration
under min/max orders, as well as tasks concerning CQs with predicates of the
form x <= min X , where X is a set of variables and x is a single variable:
counting, enumeration, direct access, and predicate elimination (i.e.,
transforming the pair of query and database to an equivalent pair without
min-predicates). For each task, we establish a complete dichotomy for
self-join-free CQs, precisely identifying the cases that are solvable in
near-ideal time, i.e., (quasi)linear preprocessing time followed by constant or
logarithmic time per output.
