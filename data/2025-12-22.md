Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: V-Agent uses a fine-tuned VLM with multimodal embeddings and a three-agent architecture to perform context-aware video search and interactive dialogue, achieving SOTA zero-shot results on MultiVENT 2.0.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build an effective multimodal video search and conversational system that overcomes text-based retrieval limitations by leveraging vision-language models and multimodal embeddings.

Method: Fine-tune a VLM with a small video preference dataset; use image-text retrieval model for retrieval vectors; embed video frames and ASR transcriptions into a shared multimodal space; system has three agents (routing, search, chat); search agent uses retrieval model plus re-ranking module.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark; improved context-aware video search and interactive conversation capabilities.

Conclusion: V-Agent effectively combines VLM-based retrieval, multimodal embeddings, and multi-agent collaboration to enable advanced video search and conversational interactions, showing strong zero-shot performance and practical application potential.

Abstract: We introduce V-Agent, a novel multi-agent platform designed for advanced video search and interactive user-system conversations. By fine-tuning a vision-language model (VLM) with a small video preference dataset and enhancing it with a retrieval vector from an image-text retrieval model, we overcome the limitations of traditional text-based retrieval systems in multimodal scenarios. The VLM-based retrieval model independently embeds video frames and audio transcriptions from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) module into a shared multimodal representation space, enabling V-Agent to interpret both visual and spoken content for context-aware video search. This system consists of three agents-a routing agent, a search agent, and a chat agent-that work collaboratively to address user intents by refining search outputs and communicating with users. The search agent utilizes the VLM-based retrieval model together with an additional re-ranking module to further enhance video retrieval quality. Our proposed framework demonstrates state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on the MultiVENT 2.0 benchmark, highlighting its potential for both academic research and real-world applications.

*Reza Chandra,Adang Suhendra,Lintang Yuniar Banowosari,Prihandoko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用CNN与VGG-16比较识别含色情图像的网站，结果显示在特定参数下CNN取得94.87%准确率，优于VGG-16。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印尼大规模封禁网站仍可通过VPN访问，迫切需要快速自动识别可能含色情内容的网站以协助监管与过滤。

Method: 采用深度学习的卷积神经网络(CNN)和VGG-16预训练模型进行图像分类，比对不同超参数（如epoch与学习率）下的表现，寻找最快且最准确的模型配置。

Result: 在多次实验中，最佳表现为CNN在epoch=50、学习率=0.001时，准确率为0.9487（94.87%），优于VGG-16实现的结果。

Conclusion: 针对快速识别色情图像任务，定制的CNN在本文数据与设置下比VGG-16更有效，但需要注意数据集构成、泛化能力和实际部署时的隐私/伦理问题。

Abstract: In 2020, a total of 59,741 websites were blocked by the Indonesian government due to containing negative content, including pornography, with 14,266 websites falling into this category. However, these blocked websites could still be accessed by the public using virtual private networks (VPNs). This prompted the research idea to quickly identify pornographic content. This study aims to develop a system capable of identifying websites suspected of containing pornographic image content, using a deep learning approach with convolutional neural network (CNN) and visual geometry group 16 (VGG-16) model. The two models were then explored comprehensively and holistically to determine which model was most effective in detecting pornographic content quickly. Based on the findings of the comparison between testing the CNN and VGG-16 models, research results showed that the best test results were obtained in the eighth experiment using the CNN model at an epoch value level of 50 and a learning rate of 0.001 of 0.9487 or 94.87%. This can be interpreted that the CNN model is more effective in detecting pornographic content quickly and accurately compared to using the VGG-16 model.

### [3] [AVM: Towards Structure-Preserving Neural Response Modeling in the Visual Cortex Across Stimuli and Individuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16948)
*Qi Xu,Shuai Gong,Xuming Ran,Haihua Luo,Yangfan Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AVM通过冻结Vision Transformer编码器并添加条件感知的模块化调制路径，实现了更好的跨刺激、跨被试和跨数据集泛化，优于V1T，且在跨数据集适配上FEVE提升9.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习神经编码模型难以在保持稳定视觉表征的同时解释条件特异性适配（如刺激变化和个体差异），限制了泛化性。解决方案需在不破坏核心表征的情况下，引入灵活的条件适配机制。

Method: AVM使用被冻结的ViT编码器捕获一致视觉特征，外接独立训练的调制路径（模块化子网）分别对刺激内容和被试身份导致的神经反应差异进行建模，从而无需修改核心表示即可实现条件感知的适配。

Result: AVM保持主编码器不变，通过独立模块化的调制路径来建模不同条件下（比如刺激内容和个体差异）引起的神经反应变化，从而增强泛化性和可解释性。

Conclusion: AVM在不同设置（刺激级变化、跨被试泛化、跨数据集适配）下均优于现有V1T模型，尤其在跨数据集适配中FEVE提升9.1%，表明其在结构约束下提供了高效、可解释且可扩展的神经建模框架。

Abstract: While deep learning models have shown strong performance in simulating neural responses, they often fail to clearly separate stable visual encoding from condition-specific adaptation, which limits their ability to generalize across stimuli and individuals. We introduce the Adaptive Visual Model (AVM), a structure-preserving framework that enables condition-aware adaptation through modular subnetworks, without modifying the core representation. AVM keeps a Vision Transformer-based encoder frozen to capture consistent visual features, while independently trained modulation paths account for neural response variations driven by stimulus content and subject identity. We evaluate AVM in three experimental settings, including stimulus-level variation, cross-subject generalization, and cross-dataset adaptation, all of which involve structured changes in inputs and individuals. Across two large-scale mouse V1 datasets, AVM outperforms the state-of-the-art V1T model by approximately 2% in predictive correlation, demonstrating robust generalization, interpretable condition-wise modulation, and high architectural efficiency. Specifically, AVM achieves a 9.1% improvement in explained variance (FEVE) under the cross-dataset adaptation setting. These results suggest that AVM provides a unified framework for adaptive neural modeling across biological and experimental conditions, offering a scalable solution under structural constraints. Its design may inform future approaches to cortical modeling in both neuroscience and biologically inspired AI systems.

### [4] [Enhancing Tree Species Classification: Insights from YOLOv8 and Explainable AI Applied to TLS Point Cloud Projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16950)
*Adrian Straker,Paul Magdon,Marco Zullich,Maximilian Freudenberg,Christoph Kleinn,Johannes Breidenbach,Stefano Puliti,Nils Nölke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用2,445株树的TLS数据训练YOLOv8并用Finer-CAM解释，发现模型主要依据冠部（及细枝）特征区分树种，不同物种侧重不同结构，结果贴合专家判断，提示需加强对模型决策过程的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管TLS和深度学习在树种分类上精度高，但决策过程不透明；需要解释方法来识别哪些结构特征驱动分类，从而发现数据/模型偏差并增强信任。

Method: 采集2,445株、七种欧洲树的TLS数据；训练五个YOLOv8模型并交叉验证；生成630张Finer-CAM显著性图；将显著区域映射到TLS投影的结构性树段（如冠、干、细枝）以统计哪些特征被模型利用。

Result: 五个YOLOv8模型平均准确率96%（SD=0.24%）。630张显著图分析显示：银桦、欧洲山毛榉、英橡与挪威云杉主要依赖冠特征；欧洲梣、苏格兰松与道格拉斯冷杉更多依赖干/细枝；细枝表征在决策中尤为重要；模型对树种相似性的判定与专家一致。

Conclusion: 本文提出将Finer-CAM解释与TLS投影的结构性树段连接起来，以系统评估哪些特征驱动树种区分。通过YOLOv8模型与630张显著性图的分析，发现模型主要依赖冠部特征进行分类，不同树种对冠、干和细枝的依赖各异，结果与专家相符，强调需更好理解模型决策以识别数据和模型偏差。

Abstract: Classifying tree species has been a core research area in forest remote sensing for decades. New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir. Particularly representations of finer branches contribute to the decisions of the models. The models consider those tree species similar to each other which a human expert would also regard as similar. Furthermore, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of the decision processes of tree species classification models to help reveal data set and model limitations, biases, and to build confidence in model predictions.

### [5] [Lights, Camera, Consistency: A Multistage Pipeline for Character-Stable AI Video Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16954)
*Chayan Jain,Rishant Sharma,Archit Garg,Ishan Bhanuka,Pratik Narang,Dhruv Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出电影制片式的分阶段管线：脚本->视觉锚点->分场景视频合成；视觉锚点对角色一致性至关重要；发现印度与西方主题生成存在文化偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频生成中人物一致性差、叙事连贯性不足的问题，通过引入制作脚本和视觉锚点来提高角色身份保持和场景一致性。

Method: 作者提出了一个分阶段的文本到视频生成流程：先用大语言模型生成详细的制作脚本，再用文本到图像模型为每个角色生成一致的视觉锚点，然后基于这些视觉锚点对每个场景分别合成视频。

Result: 消融实验显示，去掉视觉锚点会导致角色一致性评分从7.99降到0.55，说明视觉先验对保持身份一致性至关重要。

Conclusion: 多阶段分解和视觉锚点是实现长视频中角色一致性的关键，同时模型在不同文化主题下存在偏差。

Abstract: Generating long, cohesive video stories with consistent characters is a significant challenge for current text-to-video AI. We introduce a method that approaches video generation in a filmmaker-like manner. Instead of creating a video in one step, our proposed pipeline first uses a large language model to generate a detailed production script. This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation. Furthermore, we analyze cultural disparities in current models, revealing distinct biases in subject consistency and dynamic degree between Indian vs Western-themed generations.

TL;DR: 提出InfoTok，一种基于信息量分配的自适应视频令牌化方法，基于ELBO理论推导并用Transformer实现，实验证明显著节省令牌并提升压缩率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频序列信息量不均且长序列处理对token数敏感，需自适应令牌化以减少冗余和信息丢失。

Method: 提出InfoTok框架：证明数据无关训练在表示长度上次优，基于ELBO推导最优近似算法，并实现基于Transformer的自适应压缩器用于分配令牌。

Result: 实验显示在不损失性能下节省20%令牌，能达到2.3倍压缩率并优于先前启发式方法。

Conclusion: 按信息量分配令牌可在更高压缩率下保持或提升表示质量，为视频令牌化和长序列建模提供理论与实践指导。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient discrete video tokenization is essential for long video sequences processing. Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.

*Hao Li,Daiwei Lu,Xing Yao,Nicholas Kavoussi,Ipek Oguz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Endo-SemiS，一种面向内镜视频的半监督分割框架；通过交叉监督、不确定性引导伪标签、联合伪标签监督和相互学习四种策略以及单独的时空校正网络，利用有限标注与大量未标注数据提升分割性能；在肾结石和息肉两个临床数据集上优于现有方法，代码开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗内镜视频标注成本高，标注数据有限；需利用未标注视频帧提升分割精度和鲁棒性，满足临床应用（如肾结石手术与息肉筛查）要求。

Method: Endo-SemiS包含两条独立网络并行训练：1) 交叉监督——两网络互为监督信号；2) 不确定性引导伪标签——从未标注数据生成高置信区域作为伪标签；3) 联合伪标签监督——聚合两网络可靠像素提供精确监督；4) 相互学习——在特征与图像层面互学以降低方差并达成一致；此外，引入单独的时空校正网络利用视频时序信息进一步修正分割结果。

Result: 在两个内镜任务（输尿管镜肾结石激光粉碎与结肠镜息肉检测）上，Endo-SemiS在有限标注设置下显著优于多种先进分割方法，提升分割准确性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过协同的伪标签生成与互监督策略，结合时空校正，Endo-SemiS能有效利用未标注内镜视频数据，降低对标注需求并提升临床分割性能，具有实用价值和推广潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Endo-SemiS, a semi-supervised segmentation framework for providing reliable segmentation of endoscopic video frames with limited annotation. EndoSemiS uses 4 strategies to improve performance by effectively utilizing all available data, particularly unlabeled data: (1) Cross-supervision between two individual networks that supervise each other; (2) Uncertainty-guided pseudo-labels from unlabeled data, which are generated by selecting high-confidence regions to improve their quality; (3) Joint pseudolabel supervision, which aggregates reliable pixels from the pseudo-labels of both networks to provide accurate supervision for unlabeled data; and (4) Mutual learning, where both networks learn from each other at the feature and image levels, reducing variance and guiding them toward a consistent solution. Additionally, a separate corrective network that utilizes spatiotemporal information from endoscopy video to improve segmentation performance. Endo-SemiS is evaluated on two clinical applications: kidney stone laser lithotomy from ureteroscopy and polyp screening from colonoscopy. Compared to state-of-the-art segmentation methods, Endo-SemiS substantially achieves superior results on both datasets with limited labeled data. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MedICL-VU/Endo-SemiS

TL;DR: 提出LongShOTBench基准与LongShOTAgent，专注长时多模态视频理解；人类验证样本与分级评分；现有模型表现不佳，最强为Gemini-2.5-Flash 52.95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准要么注重时长要么注重多模态，但很少兼顾二者并提供可解释的失败模式分析，因此需要一个涵盖长时、丰富模态、开放式问题与可追溯评分的诊断基准。

Method: 构建可扩展的人类验证数据生成流水线，设计开放式/多轮问题与意图驱动任务，提供参考答案与分级评分表；开发LongShOTAgent，通过预处理、搜索与迭代细化来分析长视频；在基准上评估多种MLLMs并报告性能。

Result: LongShOTBench: diagnostic benchmark for long-form multimodal video understanding with open-ended questions, dialogues, multimodal reasoning, agentic tool use; human-validated, includes reference answers and graded rubrics; LongShOTAgent: agentic system for analyzing long videos. Empirical results: Gemini-2.5-Flash 52.95%, LongShOTAgent 44.66%, open-source <30%. Resources on GitHub.

Conclusion: Current state-of-the-art models struggle on long-form multimodal tasks; benchmark reveals large performance gaps and need for improved models and agentic strategies.

Abstract: Long-form multimodal video understanding requires integrating vision, speech, and ambient audio with coherent long-range reasoning. Existing benchmarks emphasize either temporal length or multimodal richness, but rarely both and while some incorporate open-ended questions and advanced metrics, they mostly rely on single-score accuracy, obscuring failure modes. We introduce LongShOTBench, a diagnostic benchmark with open-ended, intent-driven questions; single- and multi-turn dialogues; and tasks requiring multimodal reasoning and agentic tool use across video, audio, and speech. Each item includes a reference answer and graded rubric for interpretable, and traceable evaluation. LongShOTBench is produced via a scalable, human-validated pipeline to ensure coverage and reproducibility. All samples in our LongShOTBench are human-verified and corrected. Furthermore, we present LongShOTAgent, an agentic system that analyzes long videos via preprocessing, search, and iterative refinement. On LongShOTBench, state-of-the-art MLLMs show large gaps: Gemini-2.5-Flash achieves 52.95%, open-source models remain below 30%, and LongShOTAgent attains 44.66%. These results underscore the difficulty of real-world long-form video understanding. LongShOTBench provides a practical, reproducible foundation for evaluating and improving MLLMs. All resources are available on GitHub: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/longshot.

*Chiao-An Yang,Ryo Hachiuma,Sifei Liu,Subhashree Radhakrishnan,Raymond A. Yeh,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Min-Hung Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出4D-RGPT模型、Perceptual 4D Distillation训练框架和R4D-Bench基准，提升了模型在动态深度场景与区域级提示下的时空与3D推理能力，并在现有与新基准上取得明显提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大模型在处理三维结构和时间动态（4D）时能力不足，且现有基准偏重静态场景且缺乏区域级提示，阻碍模型对深度信息与时序变化的理解能力的评估与提升。

Method: 提出4D-RGPT以强化视频输入的时序感知，设计Perceptual 4D Distillation（P4D）从冻结的专家模型中蒸馏4D表征到4D-RGPT，并构建R4D-Bench用于评价区域级、深度感知的动态场景理解。

Result: 4D-RGPT在既有4D VQA基准及新构建的R4D-Bench上均表现出显著提升，表明P4D蒸馏与区域级基准有效增强了模型的4D认知能力。

Conclusion: 4D-RGPT and P4D together improve MLLM temporal and 3D reasoning; R4D-Bench fills dataset gaps with region-level, depth-aware dynamic scenes; experiments show notable improvements.

Abstract: Despite advances in Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their ability to reason over 3D structures and temporal dynamics remains limited, constrained by weak 4D perception and temporal understanding. Existing 3D and 4D Video Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks also emphasize static scenes and lack region-level prompting. We tackle these issues by introducing: (a) 4D-RGPT, a specialized MLLM designed to capture 4D representations from video inputs with enhanced temporal perception; (b) Perceptual 4D Distillation (P4D), a training framework that transfers 4D representations from a frozen expert model into 4D-RGPT for comprehensive 4D perception; and (c) R4D-Bench, a benchmark for depth-aware dynamic scenes with region-level prompting, built via a hybrid automated and human-verified pipeline. Our 4D-RGPT achieves notable improvements on both existing 4D VQA benchmarks and the proposed R4D-Bench benchmark.

TL;DR: Created 2014-2024 1.5m canopy height maps from SPOT using PVTv2 + postprocessing, producing annual disturbance polygons that beat benchmarks (F1=0.44 in mountains) and enable tree-level monitoring of subtle disturbances


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need spatially explicit, frequently updated forest monitoring at tree scale because existing products miss sub-100 m^2 changes and European carbon sink decline requires better tools

Method: Hierarchical transformer (PVTv2) on annual SPOT-6/7 composites + co-registration + spatio-temporal total variation denoising; trained on ALS

Result: Nationwide 1.5 m canopy height maps (2014-2024) + annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-Δ) for mainland France; outperform existing products, especially in mountainous fragmented forests (F1=0.44), enable tree-level monitoring and better quantify subtle disturbances

Conclusion: FORMSpoT-Δ enables high-resolution, nationwide tree-level disturbance detection outperforming existing products; sustaining high-resolution satellites and open-data is critical

Abstract: The recent decline of the European forest carbon sink highlights the need for spatially explicit and frequently updated forest monitoring tools. Yet, existing satellite-based disturbance products remain too coarse to detect changes at the scale of individual trees, typically below 100 m$^{2}$. Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$Δ$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$Δ$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$Δ$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging. These results underscore the critical importance of sustaining very high-resolution satellite missions like SPOT and open-data initiatives such as DINAMIS for monitoring forests under climate change.

Conclusion: 通过在2D潜空间中直接编码旋转并结合多样化轨迹的数据增强，可实现无深度估计的高姿态保真相机控制视频生成

Abstract: Recent progress in video diffusion models has spurred growing interest in camera-controlled novel-view video generation for dynamic scenes, aiming to provide creators with cinematic camera control capabilities in post-production. A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

TL;DR: 提出IUS，一种基于临床相关特征的可解释合成数据相似性度量，可显著提升使用合成图像训练的分类器性能，并适用于多种医学影像模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估合成医学图像与真实图像集在DL临床决策支持系统中相似性的定量方法缺失，目前主要依赖用户评价、inception类指标和分类性能，需提出可解释且与临床特征相关的新度量。

Method: 提出可解释效用相似性（IUS），受广义神经加性模型启发，通过基于临床相关图像特征评估合成数据在训练DL分类器时的效用来衡量与真实数据的相似性，强调解释性并与inception类指标区分。

Result: 在多种彩色医学成像模态（内镜、皮肤镜、眼底）上实验表明：使用IUS选择高相似性合成图像可在分类性能上带来最多54.6%的相对提升；并在灰度X光和超声模态上验证了IUS的通用性。

Conclusion: IUS提供了一种可解释且与临床特征相关的合成数据评估手段，有助于挑选对构建DL临床决策支持系统最有用的合成图像，且适用于多种成像模态。

Abstract: Synthetic medical image data can unlock the potential of deep learning (DL)-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems through the creation of large scale, privacy-preserving, training sets. Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: "How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance. The generality of IUS for synthetic data assessment is demonstrated also for greyscale X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities. IUS implementation is available at https://github.com/innoisys/ius

Abstract: The creation of photorealistic dynamic hair remains a major challenge in digital human modeling because of the complex motions, occlusions, and light scattering. Existing methods often resort to static capture and physics-based models that do not scale as they require manual parameter fine-tuning to handle the diversity of hairstyles and motions, and heavy computation to obtain high-quality appearance. In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation. DGH achieves promising geometry and appearance results, providing a scalable, data-driven alternative to physics-based simulation and rendering.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了用于海事雷达帧预测的预测建模方法，重点评估基于Transformer的时空序列预测方法。结论是：尽管在AIS轨迹预测和声纳帧预测中Transformer已被成功应用，但在海事雷达帧预测方面尚无相关工作，存在明确研究空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海事自主系统需要可靠的预测能力以提前预判船舶运动和环境动态。雷达由于全天候可靠性，是海上导航与感知的重要传感器，但针对雷达帧的预测研究尚未被系统梳理或使用Transformer方法探索，存在理论与应用上的空缺。

Method: 对现有文献进行系统性综述，聚焦以下维度：数据类型（AIS、声纳、雷达帧等）、模型架构（尤其是Transformer及其变体）、预测时域（短中长期）和任务（轨迹预测、帧预测、像素级预测等）。比较并分析代表性方法的设计、优势与限制，评估其对海事雷达帧预测的适用性以及可能的技术挑战。

Result: 综述发现：Transformer在AIS轨迹预测和声纳帧预测中显示出强大性能，尤其在捕捉长期依赖和复杂时空关系方面；然而，当前公开文献中未见针对海事雷达帧的Transformer预测研究。文章总结了不同方法在数据需求、计算复杂度、时空建模能力和实时性方面的差异，并指出将方法直接迁移到雷达帧上的潜在问题（如雷达数据特性、噪声、遮挡与回波特性）。

Conclusion: 明确指出海事雷达帧的Transformer-based预测尚属空白，建议未来工作包括：构建并公开海事雷达视频/序列数据集、设计针对雷达特性的时空Transformer变体（噪声鲁棒、稀疏注意力、频域建模等）、跨模态融合（AIS/声纳/雷达）和实时部署优化。该方向对提升海事自主系统的感知与规划能力具有重大意义。

Abstract: Maritime autonomous systems require robust predictive capabilities to anticipate vessel motion and environmental dynamics. While transformer architectures have revolutionized AIS-based trajectory prediction and demonstrated feasibility for sonar frame forecasting, their application to maritime radar frame prediction remains unexplored, creating a critical gap given radar's all-weather reliability for navigation. This survey systematically reviews predictive modeling approaches relevant to maritime radar, with emphasis on transformer architectures for spatiotemporal sequence forecasting, where existing representative methods are analyzed according to data type, architecture, and prediction horizon. Our review shows that, while the literature has demonstrated transformer-based frame prediction for sonar sensing, no prior work addresses transformer-based maritime radar frame prediction, thereby defining a clear research gap and motivating a concrete research direction for future work in this area.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SDUM：基于Restormer的可扩展深度展开模型，包含采样感知数据一致性、学习线圈敏感图估计、通用条件输入和渐进级联扩展训练；单模型在多任务、多数据集上达到或超过SOTA，且重建性能随参数对数增长


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习MRI重建通常为协议专用，难以在多样化临床MRI协议间泛化与部署，需一种通用且可扩展的框架以适应不同成像目标、对比、采样模式和加速比

Method: Unrolled reconstruction using Restormer reconstructor, learned coil sensitivity mapping, sampling-aware weighted data consistency, universal conditioning on cascade and metadata, progressive cascade expansion training

Result: Single SDUM model achieves SOTA across multiple MRI reconstruction benchmarks (CMRxRecon2025 tracks, CMRxRecon2024, fastMRI brain) without task-specific fine-tuning; shows scaling law PSNR ~ log(parameters) correlation r=0.986 up to 18 cascades; ablation gains: SWDC +0.43 dB, per-cascade CSME +0.51 dB, UC +0.38 dB

Conclusion: SDUM is a universal, scalable MRI reconstruction framework that generalizes across protocols and benefits predictably from increased depth, providing a practical route toward foundation-model-like MRI reconstructor

Abstract: Clinical MRI encompasses diverse imaging protocols--spanning anatomical targets (cardiac, brain, knee), contrasts (T1, T2, mapping), sampling patterns (Cartesian, radial, spiral, kt-space), and acceleration factors--yet current deep learning reconstructions are typically protocol-specific, hindering generalization and deployment. We introduce Scalable Deep Unrolled Model (SDUM), a universal framework combining a Restormer-based reconstructor, a learned coil sensitivity map estimator (CSME), sampling-aware weighted data consistency (SWDC), universal conditioning (UC) on cascade index and protocol metadata, and progressive cascade expansion training. SDUM exhibits foundation-model-like scaling behavior: reconstruction quality follows PSNR ${\sim}$ log(parameters) with correlation $r{=}0.986$ ($R^2{=}0.973$) up to 18 cascades, demonstrating predictable performance gains with model depth. A single SDUM trained on heterogeneous data achieves state-of-the-art results across all four CMRxRecon2025 challenge tracks--multi-center, multi-disease, 5T, and pediatric--without task-specific fine-tuning, surpassing specialized baselines by up to ${+}1.0$~dB. On CMRxRecon2024, SDUM outperforms the winning method PromptMR+ by ${+}0.55$~dB; on fastMRI brain, it exceeds PC-RNN by ${+}1.8$~dB. Ablations validate each component: SWDC ${+}0.43$~dB over standard DC, per-cascade CSME ${+}0.51$~dB, UC ${+}0.38$~dB. These results establish SDUM as a practical path toward universal, scalable MRI reconstruction.

Motivation: 目标是将普通“在野外”拍摄的人像转换为由专业摄影师拍摄的效果（良好光照、有趣姿势、单一环境和标准服装），同时保留个体独有的身份和面部/身体特征，但缺乏成对训练数据。

Method: 1) 将输入图像和人脸映射到规范UV空间，利用UV空间便于处理遮挡、视角变化并使用无配对数据；2) 结合重姿势/新视角合成方法生成目标姿势；3) 使用多图像微调对个体进行个性化，以更好地保留身份特征；4) 生成标准服装、简洁背景和优良光照的“专业”人像。

Result: 提出了一种将普通人像照片转化为“专业”风格人像的方法，重点是保持身份特征、面部和身体细节，同时改变姿势、光照和服装风格（标准黑色上下装）。方法通过将输入照片和人脸映射到规范的UV空间，结合重姿势（reposing）技术来建模遮挡和新视角合成，并通过多图像微调实现个性化。该方法可利用无配对数据集并在真实图像上表现出高质量的重姿势人像。

Conclusion: 在无配对数据和多身份场景下，基于UV空间的重姿势与多图像微调策略能够在保持身份一致性的前提下生成高质量、可重定位的“专业”人像。该方法在定性和定量评估中均表现良好，适用于真实世界图像。

Abstract: Photographs of people taken by professional photographers typically present the person in beautiful lighting, with an interesting pose, and flattering quality. This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis. Operating in UV space allows us to leverage existing unpaired datasets. 2) We personalize the output photo via multi image finetuning. Our approach yields high-quality, reposed portraits and achieves strong qualitative and quantitative performance on real-world imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种无训练、面向文档的背景生成框架，兼顾多页编辑和主题连续性，同时保证文本可读性和视觉一致性。核心贡献包括：基于扩散空间的软掩码（latent masking）用于保护文本区域，自动化可读性优化（ARO）通过半透明圆角背景满足WCAG对比度标准，以及通过摘要与指令递归引导实现多页一致性。方法将文档视为分层结构，允许针对性编辑背景而不破坏文本或图形。实验结果表明本方法能在不需额外训练的条件下生成视觉连贯、文本可读且主题一致的多页文档，支持用户风格调整。

Abstract: We present a framework for document-centric background generation with multi-page editing and thematic continuity. To ensure text regions remain readable, we employ a \emph{latent masking} formulation that softly attenuates updates in the diffusion space, inspired by smooth barrier functions in physics and numerical optimization. In addition, we introduce \emph{Automated Readability Optimization (ARO)}, which automatically places semi-transparent, rounded backing shapes behind text regions. ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations. This design reflects how humans build continuity by retaining prior context, ensuring that visual motifs evolve coherently across an entire document. Our method further treats a document as a structured composition in which text, figures, and backgrounds are preserved or regenerated as separate layers, allowing targeted background editing without compromising readability. Finally, user-provided prompts allow stylistic adjustments in color and texture, balancing automated consistency with flexible customization. Our training-free framework produces visually coherent, text-preserving, and thematically aligned documents, bridging generative modeling with natural design workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前细粒度火势预测依赖红外图像与二值火焰掩码，但掩码信息稀疏、难以反映火焰复杂动力学；传统世界模型虽能生成视频但物理不一致，限制了灾害预测的可靠性。作者希望将物理知识与世界模型结合，改善火势演化预测的物理合理性与边界精度。

Method: 提出PhysFire-WM：1) 从物理模拟器抽取结构化燃烧动力学先验并编码进世界模型，以纠正物理不一致；2) 设计Cross-task Collaborative Training (CC-Train)，通过参数共享与梯度协调同时训练热辐射回归与空间边界分割任务，缓解掩码信息稀疏问题并融合热-几何信息；3) 在多模态数据集上训练与评估，展示物理先验与跨任务协作的效用。

Result: 在一个细粒度多模态火灾数据集上的大量实验表明，PhysFire-WM在火势传播预测上优于基线方法，既提升了物理逼真性（例如热分布一致性）又提高了几何边界精度（例如分割指标）。消融实验证明物理先验编码与CC-Train对性能均有显著贡献。

Conclusion: 将物理模拟器生成的结构化先验与跨任务协同训练融入世界模型，可有效提升火灾视频预测的物理一致性和分割精度，为将物理信息注入生成性世界模型以应对灾害预测提供了新方向与实证支持。

Abstract: Fine-grained fire prediction plays a crucial role in emergency response. Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling. Through parameter sharing and gradient coordination, CC-Train effectively integrates thermal radiation dynamics and spatial boundary delineation, enhancing both physical realism and geometric accuracy. Extensive experiments on a fine-grained multimodal fire dataset demonstrate the superior accuracy of PhysFire-WM in fire spread prediction. Validation underscores the importance of physical priors and cross-task collaboration, providing new insights for applying physics-informed world models to disaster prediction.

Conclusion: LGCLIP提出了一种基于LLM生成提示与扩散模型合成参考图像的对比学习框架，通过仅使用类标签和单一视觉编码器实现无监督（无图文配对）零样本分类，并在轻量化与效率上具有优势。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong performance in zero-shot image classification tasks. However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing. Experimental results validate the feasibility and efficiency of LGCLIP, demonstrating great performance in zero-shot classification tasks and establishing a novel paradigm for classification.

Conclusion: ABE-CLIP作为一种训练免费且易于集成的技术，有效缓解了CLIP的属性混淆问题，提高了对复合图文匹配的精度，具有良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.

Abstract: Quantifying and assessing urban greenery is consequential for planning and development, reflecting the everlasting importance of green spaces for multiple climate and well-being dimensions of cities. Evaluation can be broadly grouped into objective (e.g., measuring the amount of greenery) and subjective (e.g., polling the perception of people) approaches, which may differ -- what people see and feel about how green a place is might not match the measurements of the actual amount of vegetation. In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most. This location influence suggests that cultural, environmental, and experiential factors substantially shape how individuals observe greenery in cities.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Mobile devices equipped with a multi-camera system and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are widely used nowadays, such as self-driving cars. The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MedVLMs suffer hallucinations—producing answers not grounded in visual evidence—limiting clinical reliability. Existing fixes either need expensive annotations or are global and untargeted.

Method: Propose Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD): a plug-and-play module that uses anatomical masks to guide a three-tiered contrastive decoding (token, attention, logits) to focus model on specific regions by dynamic re-weighting.

Result: Extensive experiments on chest X-ray, CT, brain MRI, ocular ultrasound show improved regional understanding, reduced hallucinations, and better diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusion: ARCD effectively suppresses hallucinations and enhances MedVLM reliability by targeted, region-specific guidance without retraining, making it practical for diverse clinical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (MedVLMs) show immense promise in clinical applicability. However, their reliability is hindered by hallucinations, where models often fail to derive answers from visual evidence, instead relying on learned textual priors. Existing mitigation strategies for MedVLMs have distinct limitations: training-based methods rely on costly expert annotations, limiting scalability, while training-free interventions like contrastive decoding, though data-efficient, apply a global, untargeted correction whose effects in complex real-world clinical settings can be unreliable. To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance. Our module leverages an anatomical mask to direct a three-tiered contrastive decoding process. By dynamically re-weighting at the token, attention, and logits levels, it verifiably steers the model's focus onto specified regions, reinforcing anatomical understanding and suppressing factually incorrect outputs. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, including chest X-ray, CT, brain MRI, and ocular ultrasound, demonstrate our method's effectiveness in improving regional understanding, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing overall diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Pansharpening is a significant image fusion task that fuses low-resolution multispectral images (LRMSI) and high-resolution panchromatic images (PAN) to obtain high-resolution multispectral images (HRMSI). The development of the diffusion models (DM) and the end-to-end models (E2E model) has greatly improved the frontier of pansharping. DM takes the multi-step diffusion to obtain an accurate estimation of the residual between LRMSI and HRMSI. However, the multi-step process takes large computational power and is time-consuming. As for E2E models, their performance is still limited by the lack of prior and simple structure. In this paper, we propose a novel four-stage training strategy to obtain a lightweight network Fose, which fuses one-step DM and an E2E model. We perform one-step distillation on an enhanced SOTA DM for pansharping to compress the inference process from 50 steps to only 1 step. Then we fuse the E2E model with one-step DM with lightweight ensemble blocks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed Fose on three commonly used benchmarks. Moreover, we achieve a 7.42 speedup ratio compared to the baseline DM while achieving much better performance. The code and model are released at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/Fose.

Conclusion: 通过在生成前对推理策略进行隐式采样与调制，Reasoning Palette提供了一种有效的、可控的探索机制，改善大型（视觉）语言模型在推理与RL训练中的表现与可解释性。

Abstract: Exploration capacity shapes both inference-time performance and reinforcement learning (RL) training for large (vision-) language models, as stochastic sampling often yields redundant reasoning paths with little high-level diversity. This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence. A brief supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up phase allows the model to adapt to this latent conditioning. Within RL optimization, Reasoning Palette facilitates structured exploration by enabling on-demand injection for diverse reasoning modes, significantly enhancing exploration efficiency and sustained learning capability. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method enables interpretable and controllable control over the (vision-) language model's strategic behavior, thereby achieving consistent performance gains over standard RL methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CheXPO-v2用实体-关系一致性奖励替代稀疏结果奖励，解析推理为疾病-关系-解剖三元组并结合困难样本挖掘，在仅5k样本下显著优于GRPO和SOTA，减少幻觉并提高临床可验证性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在推理时出现幻觉、影响临床可靠性的问题，特别是强化学习基于稀疏结果的奖励（如GRPO）鼓励模型产生冗长且不可验证的思路链（CoT），掩盖事实错误并带来安全风险。

Method: 提出CheXPO-v2框架，核心是基于实体-关系匹配的知识图一致性奖励机制，将推理步骤解析为结构化的“三元组（疾病，关系，解剖部位）”，对不一致或幻觉进行原子级惩罚；结合困难样本挖掘策略以增强训练效果；用小规模数据（5k样本）进行训练。

Result: 在基准数据集（如MIMIC-CXR-VQA）上，CheXPO-v2显著优于GRPO和现有最先进模型；以仅5k样本实现新SOTA准确率；生成的推理更加临床合理且可验证。

Conclusion: 通过将监督从结果导向转为过程导向，并引入知识图一致性奖励，CheXPO-v2有效减少幻觉、提高数据效率并提升临床可靠性，为医疗VLM的安全部署提供可验证的推理机制。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are prone to hallucinations, compromising clinical reliability. While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to "overthink" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision. Our core innovation is a Knowledge Graph Consistency Reward mechanism driven by Entity-Relation Matching. By explicitly parsing reasoning steps into structured "Disease, Relation, Anatomy" triplets, we provide fine-grained supervision that penalizes incoherent logic and hallucinations at the atomic level. Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA. Crucially, CheXPO-v2 achieves new state-of-the-art accuracy using only 5k samples, demonstrating exceptional data efficiency while producing clinically sound and verifiable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 为解决VLM视觉编码器缺乏结构化空间信息的问题，DAVE使用自监督+有限监督预训练，并通过模型合并与集成融合策略，提升对文档与网页任务的适应性，实验证明性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM的视觉编码器在低级特征上缺乏对结构化和空间信息的建模，不利于文档理解和网页代理任务，且大规模标注成本高，故需一种能利用大量无标签数据并兼顾与不同解码器兼容的编码器。

Method: 训练流程包括：1) 自监督在无标签图像上预训练；2) 有限高质量数据上的自回归监督预训练以学习解析与定位；3) 模型合并：融合使用不同文本解码器训练的编码器以提升兼容性；4) 集成训练：将通用编码器（如SigLIP2）与专用编码器特征融合以增强泛化与任务特化能力。

Result: DAVE提出了一种专为VLMs设计的视觉编码器，针对文档理解和网页代理任务，通过无监督预训练和有限监督自回归预训练相结合的训练流程，利用模型合并和特征融合策略增强与不同解码器和通用视觉编码器的兼容性。

Conclusion: DAVE在多项文档、VQA、网页定位和代理基准上表现优越，证明其在文档和网页应用中的有效性。

Abstract: While Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across multi-modal tasks, their choice of vision encoders presents a fundamental weakness: their low-level features lack the robust structural and spatial information essential for document understanding and web agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce DAVE, a vision encoder purpose-built for VLMs and tailored for these tasks. Our training pipeline is designed to leverage abundant unlabeled data to bypass the need for costly large-scale annotations for document and web images. We begin with a self-supervised pretraining stage on unlabeled images, followed by a supervised autoregressive pretraining stage, where the model learns tasks like parsing and localization from limited, high-quality data. Within the supervised stage, we adopt two strategies to improve our encoder's alignment with both general visual knowledge and diverse document and web agentic tasks: (i) We introduce a novel model-merging scheme, combining encoders trained with different text decoders to ensure broad compatibility with different web agentic architectures. (ii) We use ensemble training to fuse features from pretrained generalist encoders (e.g., SigLIP2) with our own document and web-specific representations. Extensive experiments on classic document tasks, VQAs, web localization, and agent-based benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing DAVE as a strong vision encoder for document and web applications.

*Xuyang Li,Chenyu Li,Danfeng Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AOM: spectrum-independent tokenization + adaptive multi-scale patch embedding + multi-scale alignment and self-supervised pretraining yields robust, generalizable RSFM across sensors, bands, and resolutions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RSFMs pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions fail to generalize across sensors, missing bands, and varied spatial scales, limiting deployment.

Method: Propose AOM with (1) spectrum-independent tokenizer with per-channel band embeddings to encode spectral identity; (2) multi-scale adaptive patch embedding to modulate receptive field across resolutions; (3) multi-scale semantic alignment and channel-wise self-supervised masking & reconstruction pretraining to model spectral-spatial relationships.

Result: Extensive experiments on 10+ public datasets (Sentinel-2, Landsat, HLS, etc.) show AOM achieves SOTA under band-missing, cross-sensor, and cross-resolution scenarios.

Conclusion: AOM is a universal RSFM that handles arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolutions, improving generalization and robustness for practical remote sensing tasks.

Abstract: Optical satellites, with their diverse band layouts and ground sampling distances, supply indispensable evidence for tasks ranging from ecosystem surveillance to emergency response. However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity. To effectively capture texture and contextual patterns from sub-meter to hundred-meter imagery, we design a multi-scale adaptive patch embedding mechanism that dynamically modulates the receptive field. Furthermore, to maintain global semantic consistency across varying resolutions, AOM incorporates a multi-scale semantic alignment mechanism alongside a channel-wise self-supervised masking and reconstruction pretraining strategy that jointly models spectral-spatial relationships. Extensive experiments on over 10 public datasets, including those from Sentinel-2, Landsat, and HLS, demonstrate that AOM consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance under challenging conditions such as band missing, cross sensor, and cross resolution settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一个聚合模块（aggregator），将全局描述子同时对齐到几何连接关系和视觉相似性，从而纠正仅基于重叠/共视关系导致的错误关联。通过仅依赖重叠得分的批量采样策略和修改的对比损失，无需人工地点标签训练，并在大尺度场景上显著提升定位性能，同时保持计算与内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的视觉定位方法常用全局描述子来区分视觉相似的场景，但多数方法仅从几何线索（如共视/重叠图）构建描述子，导致鉴别力不足，且在几何约束噪声（错误重叠/配对）存在时会发生错误关联，影响定位鲁棒性。作者希望设计一个能兼顾视觉相似性与几何连通性的描述子学习模块，以提高定位精度并抵抗几何信息噪声，同时保持无监督训练和效率。

Method: 提出一个聚合模块，将图像的局部/视觉特征在图结构中学习聚合，使得全局描述子在向量空间中同时编码视觉相似性与几何连通性。训练采用仅基于重叠得分的批量采样策略（batch-mining）以及修改后的对比损失函数，避免人工地点标签。模块用于修正由不可靠重叠分数引起的错误关联。实现上强调计算与内存效率。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准数据集上（大尺度场景），该方法在定位性能上获得实质性提升，同时在计算与内存消耗上保持低开销。代码已开源。

Conclusion: 通过联合几何结构与视觉相似性的聚合描述子学习，可以有效纠正几何噪声引起的错误关联，提升视觉定位的鲁棒性和精度，并实现无监督训练和高效部署。

Abstract: Recent learning-based visual localization methods use global descriptors to disambiguate visually similar places, but existing approaches often derive these descriptors from geometric cues alone (e.g., covisibility graphs), limiting their discriminative power and reducing robustness in the presence of noisy geometric constraints. We propose an aggregator module that learns global descriptors consistent with both geometrical structure and visual similarity, ensuring that images are close in descriptor space only when they are visually similar and spatially connected. This corrects erroneous associations caused by unreliable overlap scores. Using a batch-mining strategy based solely on the overlap scores and a modified contrastive loss, our method trains without manual place labels and generalizes across diverse environments. Experiments on challenging benchmarks show substantial localization gains in large-scale environments while preserving computational and memory efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM在长链视觉推理中出现“think longer, see less”现象，源于训练时将抽象推理与策略性视觉感知过早混合，导致推理基础薄弱且缺乏何时查看的策略

Method: 一阶段：文本文本上进行解耦SFT以建立强抽象推理；二阶段：采用感知绑定的PG-CoT并使用Pivotal Perception Reward的强化学习训练何时查看策略

Result: 提出问题、方法与实验

Conclusion: 分离抽象推理与视觉感知、强化学习时机策略可显著减少视觉遗忘

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential but remain brittle in complex, long-chain visual reasoning tasks. A critical failure mode is "visual forgetting", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as "think longer, see less". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning "how-to-think") and (2) strategic visual perception ("when-to-look"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., "wait", "verify"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \textbf{Code}: \url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.

TL;DR: 提出VideoDetective，用问题感知的记忆压缩与递归聚合记忆token，能在有限上下文下高效处理超长视频并引入GLVC数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos contain massive information; MLLMs struggle due to context overload and memory limits. Only small critical info is needed per question.

Method: Introduce VideoDetective: iteratively process video sub-segments with question-aware compression using special memory tokens; recurrently aggregate and store memory tokens to update history context and reuse for subsequent segments.

Result: Can process 100K tokens (3600 frames, 1hr at 1fps) with limited context 32K, taking 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory. Outperforms baselines on multiple long video benchmarks.

Conclusion: VideoDetective efficiently enables MLLMs to seek critical clues for LVQA, reducing computation and memory while maintaining or improving performance; GLVC dataset introduced to better evaluate long-video grounding.

Abstract: Long Video Question-Answering (LVQA) presents a significant challenge for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to immense context and overloaded information, which could also lead to prohibitive memory consumption. While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage. Evaluation results across multiple long video benchmarks illustrate our method can more effectively seek critical clues from massive information.

Abstract: Learning directly from human demonstration videos is a key milestone toward scalable and generalizable robot learning. Yet existing methods rely on intermediate representations such as keypoints or trajectories, introducing information loss and cumulative errors that harm temporal and visual consistency. We present Mitty, a Diffusion Transformer that enables video In-Context Learning for end-to-end Human2Robot video generation. Built on a pretrained video diffusion model, Mitty leverages strong visual-temporal priors to translate human demonstrations into robot-execution videos without action labels or intermediate abstractions. Demonstration videos are compressed into condition tokens and fused with robot denoising tokens through bidirectional attention during diffusion. To mitigate paired-data scarcity, we also develop an automatic synthesis pipeline that produces high-quality human-robot pairs from large egocentric datasets. Experiments on Human2Robot and EPIC-Kitchens show that Mitty delivers state-of-the-art results, strong generalization to unseen environments, and new insights for scalable robot learning from human observations.

Abstract: Robust anatomical segmentation of chest X-rays (CXRs) remains challenging due to the scarcity of comprehensive annotations and the substantial variability of real-world acquisition conditions. We propose AnyCXR, a unified framework that enables generalizable multi-organ segmentation across arbitrary CXR projection angles using only synthetic supervision. The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance. These results demonstrate that AnyCXR establishes a scalable and reliable foundation for anatomy-aware CXR analysis and offers a practical pathway toward reducing annotation burdens while improving robustness across diverse imaging conditions.

Motivation: BUS images have speckle noise, artifacts, irregular lesion shapes and blurred boundaries; need robust automated segmentation.

Method: Proposed WHF module for high-frequency denoised enhancement and DAFF module for merging skip and semantic features within U-shaped Mamba network; evaluated on two public BUS datasets showing improved Dice and HD95.

Result: WDFFU-Mamba integrates wavelet-guided denoising and dual-attention fusion in a U-shaped architecture to improve BUS segmentation.

Conclusion: Wavelet-domain enhancement plus attention fusion yields superior Dice and HD95, robust and efficient across datasets.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation plays a vital role in assisting clinical diagnosis and early tumor screening. However, challenges such as speckle noise, imaging artifacts, irregular lesion morphology, and blurred boundaries severely hinder accurate segmentation. To address these challenges, this work aims to design a robust and efficient model capable of automatically segmenting breast tumors in BUS images.We propose a novel segmentation network named WDFFU-Mamba, which integrates wavelet-guided enhancement and dual-attention feature fusion within a U-shaped Mamba architecture. A Wavelet-denoised High-Frequency-guided Feature (WHF) module is employed to enhance low-level representations through noise-suppressed high-frequency cues. A Dual Attention Feature Fusion (DAFF) module is also introduced to effectively merge skip-connected and semantic features, improving contextual consistency.Extensive experiments on two public BUS datasets demonstrate that WDFFU-Mamba achieves superior segmentation accuracy, significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of Dice coefficient and 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95).The combination of wavelet-domain enhancement and attention-based fusion greatly improves both the accuracy and robustness of BUS image segmentation, while maintaining computational efficiency.The proposed WDFFU-Mamba model not only delivers strong segmentation performance but also exhibits desirable generalization ability across datasets, making it a promising solution for real-world clinical applications in breast tumor ultrasound analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超声AI多为单一任务工具，缺乏能像现代超声设备那样多功能的通用模型。作者希望验证单一通用深度学习架构是否能同时处理多器官的分类与分割任务，且效率足以临床应用。

Method: UUSIC25竞赛提供11,644张（公开+私有）训练图像，独立多中心测试集包含2,479张图像，其中包括一个训练中未见的外部中心以考察泛化能力。评估指标包括分割的Dice相似系数（DSC）、分类的AUC，以及推理时间、GPU内存等计算效率度量。共有15个有效算法参赛，以宏平均DSC与AUC比较性能。

Result: 顶尖模型（SMART）在5项分割任务的宏平均DSC为0.854，二分类任务AUC为0.766。分割普遍表现强劲（例如胎儿头部DSC 0.942），但复杂/受域移位影响的任务差异显著。乳腺癌分子分型在内部验证AUC为0.571，但在完全未见的外部中心降至0.508，显示泛化差。计算效率方面，顶尖模型在推理时间和GPU内存上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 单一通用AI架构可以在多个超声任务上同时实现高准确性与高效推理，具有替代多项单任务模型的潜力。但在未见数据上的性能下降强调了域泛化与稳健性改进的重要性，未来研究需关注数据多样性、域自适应和模型校准以推动临床部署。

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Current ultrasound AI remains fragmented into single-task tools, limiting clinical utility compared to versatile modern ultrasound systems.
  OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of single general-purpose deep learning models for multi-organ classification and segmentation.
  DESIGN: The Universal UltraSound Image Challenge 2025 (UUSIC25) involved developing algorithms on 11,644 images (public/private). Evaluation used an independent, multi-center test set of 2,479 images, including data from a center completely unseen during training to assess generalization.
  OUTCOMES: Diagnostic performance (Dice Similarity Coefficient [DSC]; Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve [AUC]) and computational efficiency (inference time, GPU memory).
  RESULTS: Of 15 valid algorithms, the top model (SMART) achieved a macro-averaged DSC of 0.854 across 5 segmentation tasks and AUC of 0.766 for binary classification. Models showed high capability in segmentation (e.g., fetal head DSC: 0.942) but variability in complex tasks subject to domain shift. Notably, in breast cancer molecular subtyping, the top model's performance dropped from AUC 0.571 (internal) to 0.508 (unseen external center), highlighting generalization challenges.
  CONCLUSIONS: General-purpose AI models achieve high accuracy and efficiency across multiple tasks using a single architecture. However, performance degradation on unseen data suggests domain generalization is critical for future clinical deployment.

Result: VLMIR integrates VLM priors into diffusion-based IR

Conclusion: Integrating visual+linguistic embeddings via VLMs improves restoration, achieving state-of-art across tasks

Abstract: Many image restoration (IR) tasks require both pixel-level fidelity and high-level semantic understanding to recover realistic photos with fine-grained details. However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出HiSIR-Net：通过SIR-Gate和ROPS在4K图像上实现干净的高分辨率异常定位，贡献SIPCBA-500数据集，实验证明优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCBA缺陷像素极少且图像分辨率高，标注稀缺，导致重建类自监督方法易产生伪影和误报，需要能在高分辨率下选择性重建并协调重叠补丁的机制。

Method: 设计轻量SIR-Gate让模型在每个像素处决定使用重建或原始输入以减少伪影；提出ROPS带位置信息的区域级补丁选择，保证跨分辨率的重叠补丁一致性；整体生成低FP率的高分辨率异常图，同时提供SIPCBA-500数据并在多数据集上验证性能与速度。

Result: HiSIR-Net提出面向高分辨率PCBA像素级定位的自监督重建框架，通过选择性输入重建门（SIR-Gate）和带位置提示的区域级优化补丁选择（ROPS）实现高分辨率下的低误报异常图。并贡献SIPCBA-500数据集。

Conclusion: 方法在自建SIPCBA-500及公开基准上表现优越，兼顾实用速度，适用于4K分辨率PCBA缺陷检测，并将在接受后开源代码与数据集。

Abstract: Automated defect inspection of assembled Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBA) is quite challenging due to the insufficient labeled data, micro-defects with just a few pixels in visually-complex and high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we present HiSIR-Net, a High resolution, Self-supervised Reconstruction framework for pixel-wise PCBA localization. Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate. To bridge the gap in high-resolution PCBA datasets, we further contribute a self-collected dataset named SIPCBA-500 of 500 images. We conduct extensive experiments on our SIPCBA-500 as well as public benchmarks, demonstrating the superior localization performance of our method while running at practical speed. Full code and dataset will be made available upon acceptance.

*Fanpu Cao,Yaofo Chen,Zeng You,Wei Luo,Cen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProCache为DiT引入时间-深度感知的非均匀缓存与选择性计算，达成近2x–2.9x加速且几乎不降质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT在生成建模上性能优异但计算代价高。现有训练-free特征缓存方法未能适应DiT的非均匀时间动态，且在过大缓存间隔下易产生误差累积，限制了加速效果与稳定性。

Method: 1) 约束感知缓存模式搜索：离线通过约束采样根据DiT在去噪过程中特征随时间与层深的变化生成非均匀激活计划；2) 选择性计算模块：对于被缓存的时间段，在深层块和重要token上进行精算以抑制误差传播，同时保持低开销。

Result: 在PixArt-alpha和DiT数据集/模型上，ProCache分别实现了最高约1.96×和2.90×的加速，且图像质量下降可忽略，显著优于此前基于缓存的方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出ProCache，一种训练-free的动态特征缓存框架，通过非均匀缓存模式搜索和选择性计算两大模块，解决了DiT中时间与深度上变化的特征演化与误差累积问题，在保持图像质量的同时显著加速推理。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling, yet their high computational cost hinders real-time deployment. While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.

*Kyeongmin Yeo,Yunhong Min,Jaihoon Kim,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 微调预训练VAE以学习材料潜空间并加入潜在局部性正则化，使得利用图像生成模型的嵌入和扩散先验来生成一致且高保真PBR纹理成为可能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型PBR纹理数据集稀缺，直接使用预训练图像生成模型会因为编码新PBR通道而导致潜在分布偏移，影响扩散模型训练和生成质量。因此需要方法在有限数据下有效利用预训练模型的先验并保持潜在分布的一致性与像素-潜在局部对应性。

Method: 主要方法包括：1) 在预训练VAE上针对PBR通道进行微调以学习材料潜空间MatLat，从而在最小化潜在分布偏移的同时加入新通道；2) 证明仅靠对应感知注意力不足以保证跨视图一致性，需保持潜在到图像映射的局部性；3) 引入潜在局部性正则化：裁剪潜在补丁并解码，对齐对应图像区域以维持像素-潜在空间的强局部对应；4) 在此基础上利用预训练图像扩散模型的嵌入和先验进行纹理生成与训练。

Result: 消融研究与与先前基线对比表明：微调VAE以学习MatLat与潜在局部性正则化显著提升了PBR纹理的细节保真度和跨视图一致性，在多个评估指标和定性结果上实现了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种生成框架，通过在给定3D网格上生成高质量物理基渲染（PBR）纹理来提升纹理保真度。作者通过微调预训练VAE并学习材料潜空间（MatLat），解决了在编码额外PBR通道时潜在分布偏移的问题，并通过潜在-图像局部性正则化加强跨视图一致性。消融实验显示各组件均对性能提升至关重要。

Abstract: We propose a generative framework for producing high-quality PBR textures on a given 3D mesh. As large-scale PBR texture datasets are scarce, our approach focuses on effectively leveraging the embedding space and diffusion priors of pretrained latent image generative models while learning a material latent space, MatLat, through targeted fine-tuning. Unlike prior methods that freeze the embedding network and thus lead to distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels and hinder subsequent diffusion training, we fine-tune the pretrained VAE so that new material channels can be incorporated with minimal latent distribution deviation. We further show that correspondence-aware attention alone is insufficient for cross-view consistency unless the latent-to-image mapping preserves locality. To enforce this locality, we introduce a regularization in the VAE fine-tuning that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns the corresponding image regions to maintain strong pixel-latent spatial correspondence. Ablation studies and comparison with previous baselines demonstrate that our framework improves PBR texture fidelity and that each component is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance.

### [40] [EMAG: Self-Rectifying Diffusion Sampling with Exponential Moving Average Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17303)
*Ankit Yadav,Ta Duc Huy,Lingqiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free attention modification (EMAG) creates harder semantically-faithful negatives via adaptive layer selection, improving sample quality and HPS beyond CFG and combining well with other guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior negative-sample-based guidance methods lack control over negative granularity and fixed layer targeting; EMAG aims to create harder, fine-grained negatives adaptively at inference to expose subtle artifacts and improve denoiser refinement.

Method: Summarize EMAG method and evaluation

Result: EMAG modifies attention maps at inference using exponential moving average statistics from the model's own activations; selects layers adaptively based on statistics; produces harder negatives that are semantically faithful; improves HPS by +0.46 over CFG and composes with APG and CADS.

Conclusion: EMAG is a training-free, inference-time attention modification that yields finer-grained negative samples and improves generation quality and HPS, and is compatible with other guidance methods.

Abstract: In diffusion and flow-matching generative models, guidance techniques are widely used to improve sample quality and consistency. Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG. We further demonstrate that EMAG naturally composes with advanced guidance techniques, such as APG and CADS, further improving HPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DRIM：用高难度可验证图像QA数据、工具调用轨迹的冷启动SFT和冗余惩罚策略的RL，促进模型进行可纠错的多轮图像CoT推理，从而提升视觉理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉-语言模型在图像链式思考中虽能调用工具分析视觉输入，但常在错误推理路径上缺乏反思与纠错能力，导致多轮推理不可靠。作者欲构建能进行深层且可靠自我反思的多轮图像推理模型。

Method: 三阶段管线：1) 数据构建——基于高分辨率图像构造高难度且可验证的多轮工具调用型图像QA；2) cold-start SFT——收集工具调用轨迹作为冷启动数据，教会模型多轮推理模式；3) RL——提出冗余惩罚策略的策略优化（redundancy-penalized policy optimization），对推理轨迹进行评判，惩罚那些在缺乏多尺度探索下给出错误答案的轨迹，以促成自我反思与更充分的探索。

Result: 大量实验表明DRIM在视觉理解基准上表现优越，能在需要多轮工具调用和纠错的任务上取得更高准确率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DRIM提出了一种用于多轮图像链式思考的框架，通过数据构建、cold-start SFT与基于冗余惩罚的RL三阶段训练，使模型在多尺度探索与自我反思上更可靠，显著提升视觉理解任务表现。

Abstract: Recent advances in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have exhibited strong reasoning capabilities on complex visual tasks by thinking with images in their Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which is achieved by actively invoking tools to analyze visual inputs rather than merely perceiving them. However, existing models often struggle to reflect on and correct themselves when attempting incorrect reasoning trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern. In the RL stage, we introduce redundancy-penalized policy optimization, which incentivizes the model to develop a self-reflective reasoning pattern. The basic idea is to impose judgment on reasoning trajectories and penalize those that produce incorrect answers without sufficient multi-scale exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DRIM achieves superior performance on visual understanding benchmarks.

*Qi Song,Honglin Li,Yingchen Yu,Haoyi Zhou,Lin Yang,Song Bai,Qi She,Zilong Huang,Yunqing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CodeDance uses executable code + balanced tool-call reward to orchestrate multi-tool visual reasoning, achieving superior performance and emergent generalizable behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of current open-source visual reasoning methods that use text-only chains, rigid visual schemas, or single-step pipelines which hinder flexibility, interpretability, and transferability on complex tasks.

Method: Introduce CodeDance, which uses executable code as a general solver: code composes and executes multiple tools, computes intermediate results, and renders visual artifacts; introduce a reward for balanced/adaptive tool-calls to balance exploration and efficiency and mitigate tool overuse; train with RL leading to emergent behaviors.

Result: CodeDance outperforms schema-driven and text-only baselines and even surpasses advanced closed models like GPT-4o and larger open-source models across benchmarks (visual search, math, chart QA); shows novel emergent tool invocations, compositions, and cross-task transfer without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Executable code is a general, scalable mechanism for visual reasoning, enabling transparent self-checkable reasoning and better performance and transfer than existing approaches.

Abstract: Recent releases such as o3 highlight human-like "thinking with images" reasoning that combines structured tool use with stepwise verification, yet most open-source approaches still rely on text-only chains, rigid visual schemas, or single-step pipelines, limiting flexibility, interpretability, and transferability on complex tasks. We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning. Extensive experiments across reasoning benchmarks (e.g., visual search, math, chart QA) show that CodeDance not only consistently outperforms schema-driven and text-only baselines, but also surpasses advanced closed models such as GPT-4o and larger open-source models.

*SuBeen Lee,GilHan Park,WonJun Moon,Hyun Seok Seong,Jae-Pil Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge（ADK）：用大语言模型离线生成类描述提示，作为组合平均向量和实例级注意力选择，两者联合提升少样本适应的VLM性能且无额外推理参数开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PEFT方法依赖固定手工提示，语义信息不足且难以处理类别不明确或与预训练分布差异大的下游任务；已有图像诱导提示虽有帮助但推理开销高，需一个高效且语义丰富的辅助提示机制。

Method: （1）离线用LLM为每个类生成多条描述性文本提示并编码为特征；（2）组合性知识：对描述特征求平均作为类的丰富语义表示；（3）实例级知识：在推理时用轻量非参数注意力从描述集中选择与输入图像最相关的描述用于增强文本表征；（4）将ADK与现有PEFT管道整合作为参数免费增强模块，进行多数据集评估验证。

Result: ADK框架提出通过离线生成并利用丰富的类描述性提示，提高VLM在少样本适应中的表现，并保持推理效率。

Conclusion: ADK作为无参数、即插即用组件，可与现有PEFT方法配合使用，通过组合性知识与实例选择的细化描述，有效改善类别歧义并在多种设置下取得SOTA表现。

Abstract: Despite the impressive zero-shot capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they often struggle in downstream tasks with distribution shifts from the pre-training data. Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios.

Motivation: 现有遥感视觉理解基准多为低分辨率或含有有缺陷的推理任务，且文本模型在无图像情况下也能竞争，说明基准无法真实评估视觉理解能力，迫切需要能覆盖超高分辨率场景且减少语言先验干扰的新基准。

Method: 收集5,329张超高分辨率遥感与无人机图像（最长边≥4000像素），设计四类任务：多选VQA、开放式VQA、图像描述与单图评估，覆盖九类感知与四种推理类型，支持多轮与多图对话；采用强LLM进行对抗性过滤以剔除易被语言先验解决的问题，随后人工逐条核验。

Result: 构建了3,864个VQA任务、3,913个图像描述任务与500个完全人工编写或核验的单图评估VQA对；在多种开源/闭源/遥感专用视觉语言模型上评测，发现模型在超高分辨率情形下仍存在显著性能差距，表明当前模型对超高分辨率视觉理解不足。

Conclusion: RSHR-Bench为更真实的遥感视觉理解与推理评估提供了资源，并通过对抗过滤与人工核验降低了语言先验干扰。实验结果表明需要更强的模型架构或训练策略来提升超高分辨率遥感图像的理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong perception and reasoning performance on existing remote sensing (RS) benchmarks. However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios. Code: https://github.com/Yunkaidang/RSHR

TL;DR: EMMA是一个涵盖12项指标的基准，评估概念擦除在稳健性、间接描述、相似概念区分及社会偏见方面的能力。评估五种方法和五类领域后，发现多数方法在隐含提示和相似概念下失败，并有偏见放大问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着T2I生成广泛应用，隐私、偏见和版权问题增多；概念擦除能在无需重新训练的前提下移除不想要的概念，但现有评估不充分，常用直接提示并覆盖概念有限。作者因此设计更严格、更社会敏感的评估基准EMMA。

Method: 构建EMMA基准，定义五个维度、12个度量标准，测试场景包括直接与间接提示、视觉相似概念、性别/种族偏见等；在5个领域（物体、名人、艺术风格、NSFW、版权）上评估5种概念擦除方法，比较图像质量、效率与稳健性等指标。

Result: 实验表明现有概念擦除方法在应对间接提示和视觉相似非目标概念时表现较差，且部分方法在性别和种族偏见上比原始模型更严重；总体上没有方法能在所有维度上均胜出。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了EMMA基准，用于全面评估文本到图像生成模型的概念擦除方法。研究发现现有方法在处理间接提示和视觉上相似的非目标概念时表现不足，且部分方法会放大性别和种族偏见。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of text-to-image (T2I) generation has raised concerns about privacy, bias, and copyright violations. Concept erasure techniques offer a promising solution by selectively removing undesired concepts from pre-trained models without requiring full retraining. However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright). Our results show that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts (i.e., generating the erased concept when it is indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts (i.e., failing to generate non-targeted concepts resembling the erased one), while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.

*Jiyun Kong,Jun-Hyuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了DESSERT，一种基于扩散模型的事件驱动单帧合成方法，通过对帧间残差进行训练以提升动态场景下的预测质量和时间一致性。采用两阶段训练：ER-VAE用于事件与残差对齐；扩散模型在残差潜空间上去噪并以事件数据条件化；并引入多时长数据增强（DLT）提高鲁棒性。实验显示在清晰度和时序一致性上优于多类现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频帧预测在动态场景中会因为缺乏下一帧信息导致预测误差；事件相机提供高时域分辨率的亮度变化信息，可补充这一缺陷，但现有基于事件的方法多依赖光流和像素基元的平移重构，易产生孔洞和模糊。作者希望利用扩散模型和残差学习，从事件数据直接合成高质量、时间一致的帧。

Method: 提出DESSERT：以预训练Stable Diffusion为基础，采用残差学习在潜空间合成目标帧与锚点帧的差异。训练分两阶段：1) ER-VAE：学习将事件帧与对应的图像残差对齐并编码到潜变量；2) 扩散模型在残差潜空间进行去噪生成，条件输入为事件数据。引入Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT)增强，通过不同时间长度的帧段训练模型以提升对时间间隔变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 在一系列基准上，DESSERT在重建清晰度和时间一致性指标上优于事件重建、基于图像的视频预测、基于事件的视频预测以及单侧事件视频帧插值等方法。生成帧更锐利并减少因位移误差引起的孔洞和模糊。

Conclusion: 通过在残差潜空间上结合事件信息和扩散生成，DESSERT有效缓解了光流基重构的缺陷，提升了动态场景下的单帧合成质量与时序一致性；DLT增强进一步提高了模型对不同时间尺度的适应性。该方法为事件相机驱动的视频预测与插帧任务提供了新的可行路径。

Abstract: Video frame prediction extrapolates future frames from previous frames, but suffers from prediction errors in dynamic scenes due to the lack of information about the next frame. Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.

Conclusion: Polysome + HISTAI-Instruct effectively enable training of competitive VLMs for WSI-level VQA, improving reproducibility and transparency

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have the potential to become co-pilots for pathologists. However, most VLMs either focus on small regions of interest within whole-slide images, provide only static slide-level outputs, or rely on data that is not publicly available, limiting reproducibility. Furthermore, training data containing WSIs paired with detailed clinical reports is scarce, restricting progress toward transparent and generalisable VLMs. We address these limitations with three main contributions. First, we introduce Polysome, a standardised tool for synthetic instruction generation. Second, we apply Polysome to the public HISTAI dataset, generating HISTAI-Instruct, a large whole-slide instruction tuning dataset spanning 24,259 slides and over 1.1 million instruction-response pairs. Finally, we use HISTAI-Instruct to train ANTONI-α, a VLM capable of visual-question answering (VQA). We show that ANTONI-α outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks of tissue identification, neoplasm detection, and differential diagnosis. We also compare the performance of multiple incarnations of ANTONI-α trained with different amounts of data. All methods, data, and code are publicly available.

TL;DR: SynergyWarpNet通过显式3D稠密光流粗对齐、跨三维关键点与多参考纹理的交叉注意语义修正，以及基于学习置信度的空间自适应融合，协同利用结构对齐与语义补全，提升了说话人动画的保真度与一致性，达到了SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人脸/肖像动画中：显式扭曲方法易失真或无法修复遮挡/缺失区域；纯注意力/自注意力扭曲方法虽能补全语义，但计算复杂且缺乏几何约束，导致结构错位。论文动机是将显式几何对齐与注意力驱动的语义补全结合，取长补短以提升鲁棒性与视觉质量。

Method: 提出三阶段流水线：1）显式扭曲模块：用3D稠密光流在源图与驱动图间做粗对齐（强化几何一致性）；2）参考增强修正模块：对来自多参考图像的纹理特征与三维关键点采用跨注意力机制，语义补全被遮挡或扭曲区域；3）置信度引导融合模块：学习生成置信度图并进行空间自适应融合，在结构对齐和视觉一致性间平衡，输出最终合成。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的综合评估表明，SynergyWarpNet在视觉质量、结构一致性和遮挡/缺失区域恢复方面优于现有显式或注意力仅驱动的方法，达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了SynergyWarpNet，一种结合显式和注意力引导的协同扭曲框架，以实现高保真说话人动画合成。通过三阶段流程（显式粗对齐、参考增强的语义修正、置信度引导的融合），解决了传统显式扭曲无法精确传递运动或恢复缺失区域以及纯注意力方法计算复杂且几何约束弱的问题。实验在基准数据集上展示了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural portrait animation have demonstrated remarked potential for applications in virtual avatars, telepresence, and digital content creation. However, traditional explicit warping approaches often struggle with accurate motion transfer or recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based warping methods, though effective, frequently suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow. Next, a reference-augmented correction module leverages cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to semantically complete occluded or distorted regions. Finally, a confidence-guided fusion module integrates the warped outputs with spatially-adaptive fusing, using a learned confidence map to balance structural alignment and visual consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 为解决ERP图像由纬度引起的失真，作者提出多级失真感知可变形网络（MDDN），通过并行可变形注意力和膨胀可变形卷积扩展采样范围并用低秩分解降低计算，实验证明优于SOTA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ERP投影导致纬度相关的几何失真，现有方法采样范围与特征提取能力有限，难以捕获大范围失真模式，需要扩大感受野并适应性融合特征

Method: 设计三路并行特征提取器：可变形注意力（dilation=1）+膨胀可变形卷积（d=2,3）；多级特征融合模块自适应融合；对膨胀可变形卷积采用低秩分解以降低计算成本；在公开ODISR数据集上进行对比实验

Result: 提出了MDDN，多分支（deformable attention + dilated deformable conv d=2,3），低秩分解降算力，适用于ODISR

Conclusion: MDDN通过扩展采样范围和感受野，改进ERP图像中纬度相关的几何失真捕获，从而在公开数据集上优于现有方法

Abstract: As augmented reality and virtual reality applications gain popularity, image processing for OmniDirectional Images (ODIs) has attracted increasing attention. OmniDirectional Image Super-Resolution (ODISR) is a promising technique for enhancing the visual quality of ODIs. Before performing super-resolution, ODIs are typically projected from a spherical surface onto a plane using EquiRectangular Projection (ERP). This projection introduces latitude-dependent geometric distortion in ERP images: distortion is minimal near the equator but becomes severe toward the poles, where image content is stretched across a wider area. However, existing ODISR methods have limited sampling ranges and feature extraction capabilities, which hinder their ability to capture distorted patterns over large areas. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-level Distortion-aware Deformable Network (MDDN) for ODISR, designed to expand the sampling range and receptive field. Specifically, the feature extractor in MDDN comprises three parallel branches: a deformable attention mechanism (serving as the dilation=1 path) and two dilated deformable convolutions with dilation rates of 2 and 3. This architecture expands the sampling range to include more distorted patterns across wider areas, generating dense and comprehensive features that effectively capture geometric distortions in ERP images. The representations extracted from these deformable feature extractors are adaptively fused in a multi-level feature fusion module. Furthermore, to reduce computational cost, a low-rank decomposition strategy is applied to dilated deformable convolutions. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that MDDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and superiority in ODISR.

*Chenming Zhou,Jiaan Wang,Yu Li,Lei Li,Juan Cao,Sheng Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种像素级映射预处理方法，通过扰动图像像素分布来破坏语义线索，使检测器更关注通用的高频生成痕迹，从而显著提升跨生成器的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测器在面对未见过的生成模型时泛化性差，主要因为检测器依赖于与源模型相关的语义特征作为捷径，而非普适的生成器痕迹。为提高跨模型泛化能力，需要抑制这些易碎的语义线索。

Method: 在检测前对图像进行简单的像素级映射预处理，扰动像素值分布以打破非必要的语义模式。这一操作促使检测器学习更基础的、高频的生成痕迹而非依赖语义信息。研究在GAN和扩散模型生成图像上进行了详尽实验，评估跨生成器的检测性能提升。

Result: 实验显示，该预处理显著提升了现有最先进检测器在不同生成器之间的迁移性能。分析表明，去除语义线索是性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: 像素级扰动作为预处理是一种简单有效的策略，可强制检测器关注更普适的生成痕迹，从而改善对未见生成器的泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative technologies necessitates reliable methods for detecting AI-generated images. A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process. Through comprehensive experiments on GAN and diffusion-based generators, we show that our approach significantly boosts the cross-generator performance of state-of-the-art detectors. Extensive analysis further verifies our hypothesis that the disruption of semantic cues is the key to generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中用户以图文表达情绪，但现有图像编辑/生成方法难以从文本抽象情绪精确反映到图像上，需要专门的方法将文本情绪视觉化以提高情感表达效果。

Method: 构建AIF数据集并定义任务；AIF-B：多模态Transformer将文本情绪和图像特征融合以生成情感化图像；AIF-D：在AIF-B基础上引入预训练大规模扩散模型作为生成先验，通过条件引导与情感损失实现更深层情感反映。

Result: 定量与定性实验显示AIF在内容一致性与情感忠实度方面优于最先进方法，用户研究证明AIF更能引发目标情绪；并讨论了AIF的价值与潜在应用。

Conclusion: 本文提出Affective Image Filter (AIF)任务与数据集，并提出AIF-B与AIF-D两种模型，AIF-D利用预训练扩散模型优于现有方法，在内容一致性与情感再现上表现更好；用户研究显示AIF在唤起特定情绪方面更有效。

Abstract: Social media platforms enable users to express emotions by posting text with accompanying images. In this paper, we propose the Affective Image Filter (AIF) task, which aims to reflect visually-abstract emotions from text into visually-concrete images, thereby creating emotionally compelling results. We first introduce the AIF dataset and the formulation of the AIF models. Then, we present AIF-B as an initial attempt based on a multi-modal transformer architecture. After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive user study experiments demonstrate that AIF models are significantly more effective at evoking specific emotions. Based on the presented results, we comprehensively discuss the value and potential of AIF models.

TL;DR: 提出RadImageNet-VQA：大规模放射学VQA数据集，含75万图像与750万QA，覆盖CT/MRI、8解剖区、97病变类，三种问题形式。基准测试显示现有视觉语言模型在细粒度病变识别（尤其开放式）表现较差，去图像文本分析表明非依赖语言捷径。数据集公开可用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学VQA数据集规模小、以X光或生物插图为主且易受文本捷径影响，缺乏覆盖CT/MRI与细粒度病变识别的资源，限制模型在放射学临床场景的应用与评估。

Method: 基于专家注释构建数据集：收集并标注CT与MRI图像，生成三类任务（异常检测、解剖识别、病变识别），覆盖8个解剖区域和97类病变。生成开放式、闭合式与多项选择问题，使得每张图像对应10个QA，总计7.5M样本。通过基准实验评估当前SOTA视觉-语言模型，并进行文本仅输入的对照试验以测试语言捷径。

Result: 数据集规模大且多样，基准测试显示：1) 模型在解剖识别与异常检测上表现较好，但在细粒度病变识别上尤其开放式问题中性能显著下降；2) 监督式微调后有一定提升但仍不足；3) 文本仅输入性能接近随机，证明数据集不依赖语言捷径。公开提供数据集与基准。

Conclusion: RadImageNet-VQA为CT/MRI放射学VQA提供了大规模、专家注释与无语言捷径的基准，有助于推动模型在细粒度病变识别与临床可用性上的研究。数据公开可促进社区发展与更可靠的评估。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce RadImageNet-VQA, a large-scale dataset designed to advance radiologic visual question answering (VQA) on CT and MRI exams. Existing medical VQA datasets are limited in scale, dominated by X-ray imaging or biomedical illustrations, and often prone to text-based shortcuts. RadImageNet-VQA is built from expert-curated annotations and provides 750K images paired with 7.5M question-answer samples. It covers three key tasks - abnormality detection, anatomy recognition, and pathology identification - spanning eight anatomical regions and 97 pathology categories, and supports open-ended, closed-ended, and multiple-choice questions. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models still struggle with fine-grained pathology identification, particularly in open-ended settings and even after fine-tuning. Text-only analysis further reveals that model performance collapses to near-random without image inputs, confirming that RadImageNet-VQA is free from linguistic shortcuts. The full dataset and benchmark are publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/raidium/RadImageNet-VQA.

TL;DR: 比较多种可解释性方法并基于指标选择替代occlusion，取得≥10倍加速且无质量损失，利于临床应用推广。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI needed for clinical acceptance; occlusion is interpretable but slow; need faster alternative preserving quality for prostate cancer detection.

Method: Define comparison criteria and metrics for explanation methods; evaluate candidates against occlusion; select faster method that maintains output quality.

Result: Found alternative explanation method that is at least 10x faster with no negative impact on quality, enabling faster iteration and clinical adoption.

Conclusion: The selection approach can generalize to other applications to replace occlusion with faster explainability methods, facilitating AI adoption in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are starting to show their worth in critical applications such as assisted cancer diagnosis. However, for their outputs to get accepted in practice, the results they provide should be explainable in a way easily understood by pathologists. A well-known and widely used explanation technique is occlusion, which, however, can take a long time to compute, thus slowing the development and interaction with pathologists. In this work, we set out to find a faster replacement for occlusion in a successful system for detecting prostate cancer. Since there is no established framework for comparing the performance of various explanation methods, we first identified suitable comparison criteria and selected corresponding metrics. Based on the results, we were able to choose a different explanation method, which cut the previously required explanation time at least by a factor of 10, without any negative impact on the quality of outputs. This speedup enables rapid iteration in model development and debugging and brings us closer to adopting AI-assisted prostate cancer detection in clinical settings. We propose that our approach to finding the replacement for occlusion can be used to evaluate candidate methods in other related applications.

Abstract: Accurate flood detection from visual data is a critical step toward improving disaster response and risk assessment, yet datasets for flood segmentation remain scarce due to the challenges of collecting and annotating large-scale imagery. Existing resources are often limited in geographic scope and annotation detail, hindering the development of robust, generalized computer vision methods. To bridge this gap, we introduce AIFloodSense, a comprehensive, publicly available aerial imagery dataset comprising 470 high-resolution images from 230 distinct flood events across 64 countries and six continents. Unlike prior benchmarks, AIFloodSense ensures global diversity and temporal relevance (2022-2024), supporting three complementary tasks: (i) Image Classification with novel sub-tasks for environment type, camera angle, and continent recognition; (ii) Semantic Segmentation providing precise pixel-level masks for flood, sky, and buildings; and (iii) Visual Question Answering (VQA) to enable natural language reasoning for disaster assessment. We establish baseline benchmarks for all tasks using state-of-the-art architectures, demonstrating the dataset's complexity and its value in advancing domain-generalized AI tools for climate resilience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升智能家居场景下的视觉-语言理解与推理能力，既要在手势与活动识别等任务达到高性能，又要保持对通用多模态与文本推理任务的泛化能力，便于实际部署。

Method: 基于 MiMo-VL-7B 骨干，使用两阶段流程：1）监督微调以适应家居领域数据集；2）基于 Group Relative Policy Optimization 的强化学习优化模型行为。引入 chain-of-thought 监督和 token-budget-aware 推理来提高数据利用效率与推理经济性，利用多域高效数据进行训练。

Result: 在家居场景理解（手势识别、活动理解）上取得领先 F1，且在 Video-MME、Video-MMMU、Charades-STA、MMMU-Pro、MMLU-Pro 等视频与语言基准上获得一致提升，相较多种开/闭源基线表现更好，且家居定向训练对文本推理仅带来小幅折衷。

Conclusion: MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B 在家居场景理解与通用多模态推理上表现优越，通过两阶段训练（监督微调 + 基于 Group Relative Policy Optimization 的 RL）和 chain-of-thought 及 token-budget-aware 推理策略实现专用化与泛化的平衡，公开了模型与量化权重及评估工具。

Abstract: We open-source \textbf{MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B} and its quantized variant \textbf{MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B-GGUF}, a pair of home-centric vision-language models that achieve strong performance on both home-scenario understanding and general multimodal reasoning. Built on the MiMo-VL-7B backbone, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B is specialized for smart-home environments, attaining leading F1 scores on gesture recognition and common home-scenario understanding, while also delivering consistent gains across video benchmarks such as Video-MME, Video-MMMU, and Charades-STA, as well as language understanding benchmarks including MMMU-Pro and MMLU-Pro. In our experiments, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B outperforms strong closed-source and open-source baselines on home-scenario understanding and several multimodal reasoning benchmarks. To balance specialization and generality, we design a two-stage training pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization, leveraging efficient multi-domain data. We further incorporate chain-of-thought supervision and token-budget-aware reasoning, enabling the model to learn knowledge in a data-efficient manner while also performing reasoning efficiently. Our analysis shows that targeted home-scenario training not only enhances activity and gesture understanding, but also improves text-only reasoning with only modest trade-offs on document-centric tasks. Model checkpoints, quantized GGUF weights, and our home-scenario evaluation toolkit are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/XiaoMi/xiaomi-mimo-vl-miloco}{https://github.com/XiaoMi/xiaomi-mimo-vl-miloco} to support research and deployment in real-world smart-home applications.

TL;DR: LangDriveCTRL: natural-language-driven editing of driving videos using scene graphs + orchestrated agents + diffusion refinement, achieving ~2x instruction alignment vs SoTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable intuitive, fine-grained editing of driving videos to synthesize diverse, realistic traffic scenarios from simple text instructions.

Method: Decompose videos into 3D scene graphs; use an Orchestrator to convert instructions into execution graphs controlling agents: Object Grounding Agent (map text to scene nodes), Behavior Editing Agent (generate trajectories), Behavior Reviewer Agent (iteratively refine). Render edited graph and apply video diffusion to fix artifacts.

Result: LangDriveCTRL introduces a controllable framework for editing real-world driving videos via natural language, using 3D scene decomposition, agentic orchestration, and video diffusion refinement.

Conclusion: The system enables object-level and multi-object behavior edits from single instructions, outperforming prior state-of-the-art in instruction alignment, structural preservation, photorealism, and traffic realism.

Abstract: LangDriveCTRL is a natural-language-controllable framework for editing real-world driving videos to synthesize diverse traffic scenarios. It leverages explicit 3D scene decomposition to represent driving videos as a scene graph, containing static background and dynamic objects. To enable fine-grained editing and realism, it incorporates an agentic pipeline in which an Orchestrator transforms user instructions into execution graphs that coordinate specialized agents and tools. Specifically, an Object Grounding Agent establishes correspondence between free-form text descriptions and target object nodes in the scene graph; a Behavior Editing Agent generates multi-object trajectories from language instructions; and a Behavior Reviewer Agent iteratively reviews and refines the generated trajectories. The edited scene graph is rendered and then refined using a video diffusion tool to address artifacts introduced by object insertion and significant view changes. LangDriveCTRL supports both object node editing (removal, insertion and replacement) and multi-object behavior editing from a single natural-language instruction. Quantitatively, it achieves nearly $2\times$ higher instruction alignment than the previous SoTA, with superior structural preservation, photorealism, and traffic realism.

Motivation: 无人水面航行器在复杂海况与恶劣光照下（如夜间、雾天）视觉感知困难，单一RGB摄像头在低能见度环境下表现受限，因此需要多模态传感器数据来提高场景解释能力与检测鲁棒性。

Method: 构建并发布MULTIAQUA数据集，数据包含同步校准和标注的多模态传感器输出（RGB、热成像、红外、LIDAR等）。提出多模态训练策略，包含在白天数据上训练并通过模态融合与增强方法（如跨模态配对、伪标签、对比学习或条件归一化等）使模型在夜间保持鲁棒性。

Result: 在困难的夜间测试集上评估了若干多模态方法，结果表明所提训练方法能显著提高夜间识别与检测性能，且只用白天图像训练即可获得可靠夜间表现，简化了数据采集和标注流程。

Abstract: Unmanned surface vehicles can encounter a number of varied visual circumstances during operation, some of which can be very difficult to interpret. While most cases can be solved only using color camera images, some weather and lighting conditions require additional information. To expand the available maritime data, we present a novel multimodal maritime dataset MULTIAQUA (Multimodal Aquatic Dataset). Our dataset contains synchronized, calibrated and annotated data captured by sensors of different modalities, such as RGB, thermal, IR, LIDAR, etc. The dataset is aimed at developing supervised methods that can extract useful information from these modalities in order to provide a high quality of scene interpretation regardless of potentially poor visibility conditions. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed dataset, we evaluate several multimodal methods on our difficult nighttime test set. We present training approaches that enable multimodal methods to be trained in a more robust way, thus enabling them to retain reliable performance even in near-complete darkness. Our approach allows for training a robust deep neural network only using daytime images, thus significantly simplifying data acquisition, annotation, and the training process.

TL;DR: 3D-RE-GEN用模块化流水线从单张图像生成可编辑的纹理化3D物体与背景，并通过遮挡补全与4-DoF空间优化实现更逼真和可用的场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D场景生成方法虽视觉上吸引，但无法满足艺术家需要可修改、有纹理的3D网格场景的工作流程，现有重建方法在物体分解、空间关系与背景恢复方面仍存在显著不足，因此需要一种组合式框架来生成可编辑且物理合理的场景。

Method: 3D-RE-GEN结合资产检测、单个物体重建、遮挡区域图像编辑以恢复被遮挡物体、背景生成以提供空间约束，以及一个新颖的4-DoF可微分优化用于将物体与估计地面对齐，整个流水线通过精确相机恢复与空间优化生成一致的可修改场景。

Result: 3D-RE-GEN提出了一种组合式重建框架，将单张图像分解为可修改的有纹理3D物体和背景，并通过集成检测、重建、放置及图像编辑等模块，实现遮挡物推理、一致光照与几何 reconstruction，结合4自由度差分优化对齐地面平面，从而在单张图像场景重建中取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 通过组合领域内的最新模型并扩展其适用场景，3D-RE-GEN在物体分解、空间关系恢复和完整背景生成方面显著优于现有方法，生成的场景可用于视觉特效和游戏制作的后续修改与仿真。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene generation produce visually appealing output, but current representations hinder artists' workflows that require modifiable 3D textured mesh scenes for visual effects and game development. Despite significant advances, current textured mesh scene reconstruction methods are far from artist ready, suffering from incorrect object decomposition, inaccurate spatial relationships, and missing backgrounds. We present 3D-RE-GEN, a compositional framework that reconstructs a single image into textured 3D objects and a background. We show that combining state of the art models from specific domains achieves state of the art scene reconstruction performance, addressing artists' requirements.
  Our reconstruction pipeline integrates models for asset detection, reconstruction, and placement, pushing certain models beyond their originally intended domains. Obtaining occluded objects is treated as an image editing task with generative models to infer and reconstruct with scene level reasoning under consistent lighting and geometry. Unlike current methods, 3D-RE-GEN generates a comprehensive background that spatially constrains objects during optimization and provides a foundation for realistic lighting and simulation tasks in visual effects and games. To obtain physically realistic layouts, we employ a novel 4-DoF differentiable optimization that aligns reconstructed objects with the estimated ground plane. 3D-RE-GEN~achieves state of the art performance in single image 3D scene reconstruction, producing coherent, modifiable scenes through compositional generation guided by precise camera recovery and spatial optimization.

Method: 提出TwinSegNet框架：在联邦学习基础上采用混合架构（卷积编码器 + ViT瓶颈 + UNet解码器）以兼顾局部和全局特征；服务器聚合全局模型；各机构在本地私有数据上微调全局模型生成“数字孪生”以实现个性化；使用跨机构异构MRI数据进行训练与评估以模拟非IID场景。

Result: 在九个异构MRI数据集（包含BraTS 2019-2021及自建集合）上评估，报道Dice高达0.90（注意原文可能为0.90而非0.90%），敏感性/特异性均超过90%，并与集中式模型（如TumorVisNet）比较，显示在保护隐私的同时性能无显著下降。

Conclusion: TwinSegNet提出在联邦学习框架下结合混合ViT-UNet和个性化数字孪生的脑肿瘤分割方法，旨在在保留隐私的同时提高跨机构泛化和个性化表现。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is critical in diagnosis and treatment planning for the disease. Yet, current deep learning methods rely on centralized data collection, which raises privacy concerns and limits generalization across diverse institutions. In this paper, we propose TwinSegNet, which is a privacy-preserving federated learning framework that integrates a hybrid ViT-UNet model with personalized digital twins for accurate and real-time brain tumor segmentation. Our architecture combines convolutional encoders with Vision Transformer bottlenecks to capture local and global context. Each institution fine-tunes the global model of private data to form its digital twin. Evaluated on nine heterogeneous MRI datasets, including BraTS 2019-2021 and custom tumor collections, TwinSegNet achieves high Dice scores (up to 0.90%) and sensitivity/specificity exceeding 90%, demonstrating robustness across non-independent and identically distributed (IID) client distributions. Comparative results against centralized models such as TumorVisNet highlight TwinSegNet's effectiveness in preserving privacy without sacrificing performance. Our approach enables scalable, personalized segmentation for multi-institutional clinical settings while adhering to strict data confidentiality requirements.

*Muhammad Atif Butt,Kai Wang,Javier Vazquez-Corral,Joost Van De Weijer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumiCtrl fine-tunes a T2I model using Planckian-locus augmentations, ControlNet-based edge disentanglement, and foreground-focused masked loss to achieve accurate and coherent illuminant control from one image


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable precise, personalized lighting control in text-to-image generation to help designers manipulate mood and aesthetics from a single reference image

Method: Physics-guided fine-tuning with prompt disentanglement and masked reconstruction

Result: Higher illuminant fidelity, better aesthetics, improved scene coherence, preferred by humans over baselines

Conclusion: LumiCtrl enables controllable, personalized illuminant editing from a single object image, outperforming existing T2I personalization methods

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable progress in creative image generation, yet they still lack precise control over scene illuminants, which is a crucial factor for content designers aiming to manipulate the mood, atmosphere, and visual aesthetics of generated images. In this paper, we present an illuminant personalization method named LumiCtrl that learns an illuminant prompt given a single image of an object. LumiCtrl consists of three basic components: given an image of the object, our method applies (a) physics-based illuminant augmentation along the Planckian locus to create fine-tuning variants under standard illuminants; (b) edge-guided prompt disentanglement using a frozen ControlNet to ensure prompts focus on illumination rather than structure; and (c) a masked reconstruction loss that focuses learning on the foreground object while allowing the background to adapt contextually, enabling what we call contextual light adaptation. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods. The results show that our method achieves significantly better illuminant fidelity, aesthetic quality, and scene coherence compared to existing personalization baselines. A human preference study further confirms strong user preference for LumiCtrl outputs. The code and data will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMLANDMARKS: 18,557 US landmarks with 4 aligned modalities (aerial, ground, text, GPS); supports cross-view retrieval, geolocalization, Text-to-Image/GPS; CLIP-style baseline performs well, highlighting need for multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing geo-spatial benchmarks lack modality coverage and one-to-one alignment across modalities, limiting unified multimodal learning and evaluation; a comprehensive dataset is needed to train models that integrate images, text, and coordinates.

Method: Collect and align four modalities per landmark (high-res aerial images, ground-view photos, textual descriptions, GPS coordinates) for 18,557 landmarks; construct tasks (Ground-to-Satellite retrieval, geolocalization, Text-to-Image, Text-to-GPS); train a simple CLIP-inspired model to learn multimodal embeddings and benchmark against off-the-shelf and SOTA specialized models.

Result: MMLANDMARKS provides a unified multimodal benchmark; the CLIP-like baseline achieves broad generalization and competitive results across tasks, showing that multimodal training improves geo-spatial understanding and that the dataset fills gaps in prior benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper introduces MMLANDMARKS, a large-scale multimodal benchmark covering aerial images, ground-view images, text, and GPS coordinates for 18,557 US landmarks, enabling unified training and evaluation across geo-spatial tasks. A CLIP-like baseline shows strong generalization and competitive performance vs existing models, underscoring the value of multimodal datasets for geo-spatial understanding.

Abstract: Geo-spatial analysis of our world benefits from a multimodal approach, as every single geographic location can be described in numerous ways (images from various viewpoints, textual descriptions, and geographic coordinates). Current geo-spatial benchmarks have limited coverage across modalities, considerably restricting progress in the field, as current approaches cannot integrate all relevant modalities within a unified framework. We introduce the Multi-Modal Landmark dataset (MMLANDMARKS), a benchmark composed of four modalities: 197k highresolution aerial images, 329k ground-view images, textual information, and geographic coordinates for 18,557 distinct landmarks in the United States. The MMLANDMARKS dataset has a one-to-one correspondence across every modality, which enables training and benchmarking models for various geo-spatial tasks, including cross-view Ground-to-Satellite retrieval, ground and satellite geolocalization, Text-to-Image, and Text-to-GPS retrieval. We demonstrate broad generalization and competitive performance against off-the-shelf foundational models and specialized state-of-the-art models across different tasks by employing a simple CLIP-inspired baseline, illustrating the necessity for multimodal datasets to achieve broad geo-spatial understanding.

TL;DR: GroundingME benchmark exposes large performance gaps in MLLMs for realistic visual grounding, especially rejection; modest gains via test-time scaling and training mixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether MLLMs can ground language in vision with human-like sophistication beyond pattern-matching on simplified datasets.

Method: Introduce GroundingME benchmark across four dimensions (Discriminative, Spatial, Limited, Rejection) using automated generation plus human verification; evaluate 25 MLLMs; explore test-time scaling and data-mixture training.

Result: Best model achieves 45.1% accuracy; most models score 0% on rejection tasks; test-time scaling improves grounding by up to 2.9%; data-mixture training boosts rejection accuracy to 27.9%.

Conclusion: MLLMs have significant shortcomings in real-world visual grounding; GroundingME reveals limitations and offers improvement pathways.

Abstract: Visual grounding, localizing objects from natural language descriptions, represents a critical bridge between language and vision understanding. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%. GroundingME thus serves as both a diagnostic tool revealing current limitations in MLLMs and a roadmap toward human-level visual grounding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证AI病理在中东（库尔德斯坦）人群的性能，填补以往研究中地理和设备多样性不足的问题，推动全球公平采纳AI病理。

Method: 收集并数字化339份前列腺活检样本（185名患者，2013-2024），评估一个端到端任务特定AI模型和两个基础模型，与病理学家的一致性比较，并测试在三种扫描仪（Hamamatsu、Leica、Grundium）上的跨扫描仪一致性。

Result: AI与病理学家的分级一致性与病理学家间一致性相当（Cohen二次加权kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799，p=0.9824）。所有模型在不同扫描仪间的跨扫描仪一致性均高（加权kappa>0.90），包括低成本紧凑型扫描仪。

Conclusion: AI在前列腺组织病理评估中达到了病理学家水平。紧凑型扫描仪有助于在未数字化环境中进行验证并以低成本推广AI。首次公开的中东数字病理数据集将促进全球公平的AI病理学研究。

Abstract: Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is improving the efficiency and accuracy of cancer diagnostics. The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.
  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).
  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824). Cross-scanner concordance was high (quadratically weighted kappa > 0.90) for all AI models and scanner pairs, including low-cost compact scanner.
  Interpretation: AI models demonstrated pathologist-level performance in prostate histopathology assessment. Compact scanners can provide a route for validation studies in non-digitalised settings and enable cost-effective adoption of AI in laboratories with limited sample volumes. This first openly available digital pathology dataset from the Middle East supports further research into globally equitable AI pathology.

Motivation: See below

Method: Analyze method, results, conclusions, TL;DR, motivation from abstract

Result: See below

Conclusion: See below

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based video generation have opened new possibilities for controllable video editing, yet realistic video object insertion (VOI) remains challenging due to limited 4D scene understanding and inadequate handling of occlusion and lighting effects. We present InsertAnywhere, a new VOI framework that achieves geometrically consistent object placement and appearance-faithful video synthesis. Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework produces geometrically plausible and visually coherent object insertions across diverse real world scenarios, significantly outperforming existing research and commercial models.

TL;DR: 提出FALCON-SFOD，通过SPAR利用OV-SAM生成的类无关前景掩码来正则化特征空间，并用IRPL处理前景-背景不平衡与噪声伪标签，从而在无源目标检测中提升以物体为中心的表示和伪标签可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SFOD方法依赖Mean-Teacher自标注，但域偏移导致检测器激活扩散到背景，弱化物体聚焦，使检测头产生不可靠的高置信伪标签。以往研究主要精修伪标签，却忽视了加强特征空间物体聚焦的根本需求。

Method: FALCON-SFOD包含兩部分：1) SPAR（Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization）利用视觉基础模型（OV-SAM）生成类无关二值前景掩码，作为正则化引导检测器在特征图上聚焦结构化前景激活；2) IRPL（Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling）通过不平衡感知与鲁棒学习策略，缓解前景-背景严重不平衡并容忍伪标签噪声，提升学习稳定性。两者在理论上被证明可收紧定位与分类误差界。

Result: 在多個SFOD基准上，FALCON-SFOD取得具有竞争力的性能，显示出在域偏移下更稳健的物体聚焦与伪标签质量提升。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型的前景先验与不平衡且鲁棒的伪标签机制，可以从特征层面强化检测器的物体聚焦，从而提升无源目标检测的适应性与性能。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art approaches in Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) typically rely on Mean-Teacher self-labeling. However, domain shift often reduces the detector's ability to maintain strong object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter. This weak object focus results in unreliable pseudo-labels from the detection head. While prior works mainly refine these pseudo-labels, they overlook the underlying need to strengthen the feature space itself. We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space. Using class-agnostic binary masks derived from OV-SAM, SPAR promotes structured and foreground-focused activations by guiding the network toward object regions. IRPL (Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling) complements SPAR by promoting balanced and noise-tolerant learning under severe foreground-background imbalance. Guided by a theoretical analysis that connects these designs to tighter localization and classification error bounds, FALCON-SFOD achieves competitive performance across SFOD benchmarks.

Conclusion: Robust-R1通过监督微调、奖励驱动对齐和动态推理深度调整，在R-Bench及多个数据集上优于现有通用和鲁棒基线

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models struggle to maintain reliable performance under extreme real-world visual degradations, which impede their practical robustness. Existing robust MLLMs predominantly rely on implicit training/adaptation that focuses solely on visual encoder generalization, suffering from limited interpretability and isolated optimization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Robust-R1, a novel framework that explicitly models visual degradations through structured reasoning chains. Our approach integrates: (i) supervised fine-tuning for degradation-aware reasoning foundations, (ii) reward-driven alignment for accurately perceiving degradation parameters, and (iii) dynamic reasoning depth scaling adapted to degradation intensity. To facilitate this approach, we introduce a specialized 11K dataset featuring realistic degradations synthesized across four critical real-world visual processing stages, each annotated with structured chains connecting degradation parameters, perceptual influence, pristine semantic reasoning chain, and conclusion. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art robustness: Robust-R1 outperforms all general and robust baselines on the real-world degradation benchmark R-Bench, while maintaining superior anti-degradation performance under multi-intensity adversarial degradations on MMMB, MMStar, and RealWorldQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, accurate reconstruction of language-aligned 3D representations from arbitrary uncalibrated multi-view images without relying on scarce 3D annotations, leveraging large-scale video and 2D instance data

Method: Feed-forward network reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussians from any views with 3D-annotation-free training

Result: FLEG reconstructs 3D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner from arbitrary uncalibrated and unposed multi-view images, producing geometry, appearance, and language-aligned semantics; uses instance-guided contrastive learning and geometry-semantic hierarchical sparsification; trained on large-scale video without 3D annotations

Conclusion: FLEG outperforms existing methods in geometry, appearance, and semantic alignment while being efficient and capable with sparse or dense views

Abstract: We present FLEG, a feed-forward network that reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussians from any views. Previous straightforward solutions combine feed-forward reconstruction with Gaussian heads but suffer from fixed input views and insufficient 3D training data. In contrast, we propose a 3D-annotation-free training framework for 2D-to-3D lifting from arbitrary uncalibrated and unposed multi-view images. Since the framework does not require 3D annotations, we can leverage large-scale video data with easily obtained 2D instance information to enrich semantic embedding. We also propose an instance-guided contrastive learning to align 2D semantics with the 3D representations. In addition, to mitigate the high memory and computational cost of dense views, we further propose a geometry-semantic hierarchical sparsification strategy. Our FLEG efficiently reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussian representation in a feed-forward manner from arbitrary sparse or dense views, jointly producing accurate geometry, high-fidelity appearance, and language-aligned semantics. Extensive experiments show that it outperforms existing methods on various related tasks. Project page: https://fangzhou2000.github.io/projects/fleg.

Abstract: With 3D data rapidly emerging as an important form of multimedia information, 3D human mesh recovery technology has also advanced accordingly. However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios.

Motivation: 分析并解决在仅基于视图合成监督下回归每像素3D高斯体时几何不确定性和不一致性的问题，提升可推广性和几何一致性。

Method: 提出G3Splat：在自监督（无姿态）可推广的splatting设置中引入几何先验，结合多视图结构预测网络回归每像素3D高斯的参数（位置、方向、尺度、不透明度、外观），并在训练时加入几何约束以消除重建模糊和姿态歧义。训练数据为RE10K，并在ScanNet上做零样本测试。

Result: 在RE10K上实现了在几何一致重建、相对位姿估计和新视图合成上的最新性能；在ScanNet上零样本泛化显著优于先前方法，尤其在几何恢复和相对位姿估计上有明显提升。

Conclusion: 纯视图合成损失不足以学习几何有意义的3D Gaussian splats，引入几何先验的G3Splat能获得几何一致且可泛化的场景表示，提升重建与位姿估计性能，并在公开数据集上验证有效性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussians have recently emerged as an effective scene representation for real-time splatting and accurate novel-view synthesis, motivating several works to adapt multi-view structure prediction networks to regress per-pixel 3D Gaussians from images. However, most prior work extends these networks to predict additional Gaussian parameters -- orientation, scale, opacity, and appearance -- while relying almost exclusively on view-synthesis supervision. We show that a view-synthesis loss alone is insufficient to recover geometrically meaningful splats in this setting. We analyze and address the ambiguities of learning 3D Gaussian splats under self-supervision for pose-free generalizable splatting, and introduce G3Splat, which enforces geometric priors to obtain geometrically consistent 3D scene representations. Trained on RE10K, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in (i) geometrically consistent reconstruction, (ii) relative pose estimation, and (iii) novel-view synthesis. We further demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization on ScanNet, substantially outperforming prior work in both geometry recovery and relative pose estimation.

Conclusion: 统一模型可在多中心、多肿瘤类型与采集时间点下稳健分割FLAIR高信号，支持临床部署与开源工具集成，降低了为每种情况单独训练模型的需求。

Abstract: T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are important for diagnosis, treatment planning and monitoring of brain tumors. Depending on the brain tumor type, the FLAIR hyperintensity volume is an important measure to asses the tumor volume or surrounding edema, and an automatic segmentation of this would be useful in the clinic. In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS. The unified model achieved an average Dice score of 88.65\% for pre-operative meningiomas, 80.08% for pre-operative metastasis, 90.92% for pre-operative and 84.60% for post-operative gliomas from BraTS, and 84.47% for pre-operative and 61.27\% for post-operative lower grade gliomas. In addition, the results showed that the unified model achieved comparable segmentation performance to the dataset specific models on their respective datasets, and enables generalization across tumor types and acquisition time points, which facilitates the deployment in a clinical setting. The model is integrated into Raidionics, an open-source software for CNS tumor analysis.

Motivation: This paper addresses the need for realistic, geometrically coherent virtual furniture synthesis for indoor scenes, which is important for applications like home design and e-commerce. It targets the lack of reproducible benchmarks and limitations of current image composition methods in high-fidelity synthesis that preserves background integrity.

Method: They introduce RoomBench++, a large benchmark dataset (112,851 train pairs, 1,832 test pairs) from real videos and renderings. They propose RoomEditor++, a diffusion-based architecture with a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone compatible with U-Net and DiT, unifying feature extraction and inpainting for reference and background images; parameter-sharing enforces aligned feature representations aiding geometric transformation, texture preservation, and seamless integration.

Result: Extensive experiments show RoomEditor++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods on quantitative metrics, qualitative results, and human preference studies. It generalizes well to unseen indoor and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

Conclusion: RoomBench++ and RoomEditor++ advance virtual furniture synthesis by providing a public benchmark and a robust diffusion-based method that achieves superior synthesis quality and generalization, facilitating future research.

Abstract: Virtual furniture synthesis, which seamlessly integrates reference objects into indoor scenes while maintaining geometric coherence and visual realism, holds substantial promise for home design and e-commerce applications. However, this field remains underexplored due to the scarcity of reproducible benchmarks and the limitations of existing image composition methods in achieving high-fidelity furniture synthesis while preserving background integrity. To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task. It consists of 112,851 training pairs and 1,832 testing pairs drawn from both real-world indoor videos and realistic home design renderings, thereby supporting robust training and evaluation under practical conditions. Then, we propose RoomEditor++, a versatile diffusion-based architecture featuring a parameter-sharing dual diffusion backbone, which is compatible with both U-Net and DiT architectures. This design unifies the feature extraction and inpainting processes for reference and background images. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the parameter-sharing mechanism enforces aligned feature representations, facilitating precise geometric transformations, texture preservation, and seamless integration. Extensive experiments validate that RoomEditor++ is superior over state-of-the-art approaches in terms of quantitative metrics, qualitative assessments, and human preference studies, while highlighting its strong generalization to unseen indoor scenes and general scenes without task-specific fine-tuning.

### [74] [3One2: One-step Regression Plus One-step Diffusion for One-hot Modulation in Dual-path Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17578)
*Ge Wang,Xing Liu,Xin Yuan*

TL;DR: 将one-hot SCI重建转化为生成式视频修补，设计与硬件匹配的前向SDE，并用回归+扩散的混合流程与双光路恢复高质量视频


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: one-hot调制可实现完美时间解耦以消除时域混叠，但缺乏专门算法充分利用该特性

Method: 基于one-hot解耦把重建视为视频inpainting，提出与压缩过程相匹配的随机微分方程前向过程；发现纯扩散方法局限，提出一步回归初始化加一步扩散精炼的混合框架；在硬件层面采用双光路获取互补信息以提升空间质量。

Result: 提出了针对one-hot掩码的视频快照压缩成像（SCI）重建算法

Conclusion: 结合一阶回归初始化与一阶扩散精炼，并通过双光路弥补one-hot掩码带来的空间退化，实验验证了其有效性

Abstract: Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) captures dynamic scene sequences through a two-dimensional (2D) snapshot, fundamentally relying on optical modulation for hardware compression and the corresponding software reconstruction. While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction. Experiments conducted on synthetic datasets and real scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Benchmarking competitions are central to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical imaging, defining performance standards and shaping methodological progress. However, it remains unclear whether these benchmarks provide data that are sufficiently representative, accessible, and reusable to support clinically meaningful AI. In this work, we assess fairness along two complementary dimensions: (1) whether challenge datasets are representative of real-world clinical diversity, and (2) whether they are accessible and legally reusable in line with the FAIR principles. To address this question, we conducted a large-scale systematic study of 241 biomedical image analysis challenges comprising 458 tasks across 19 imaging modalities. Our findings show substantial biases in dataset composition, including geographic location, modality-, and problem type-related biases, indicating that current benchmarks do not adequately reflect real-world clinical diversity. Despite their widespread influence, challenge datasets were frequently constrained by restrictive or ambiguous access conditions, inconsistent or non-compliant licensing practices, and incomplete documentation, limiting reproducibility and long-term reuse. Together, these shortcomings expose foundational fairness limitations in our benchmarking ecosystem and highlight a disconnect between leaderboard success and clinical relevance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无微调的MLLM方法依赖文本输出，导致信息损失、正常偏差和提示敏感性，难以捕捉微妙异常信号。希望利用MLLM内部表示的潜力，直接在注意力头层面获取更鲁棒的异常线索。

Conclusion: 头级探测为无微调多模态大模型的视频异常检测提供了一条高效且可解释的路径，克服了文本生成方法的信息损失和提示敏感问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate events that deviate from normal patterns in videos. Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Abstract: Robust mammography registration is essential for clinical applications like tracking disease progression and monitoring longitudinal changes in breast tissue. However, progress has been limited by the absence of public datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are often not directly comparable, as they use private data and inconsistent evaluation frameworks. To address this, we present MGRegBench, a public benchmark dataset for mammogram registration. It comprises over 5,000 image pairs, with 100 containing manual anatomical landmarks and segmentation masks for rigorous evaluation. This makes MGRegBench one of the largest public 2D registration datasets with manual annotations. Using this resource, we benchmarked diverse registration methods including classical (ANTs), learning-based (VoxelMorph, TransMorph), implicit neural representation (IDIR), a classic mammography-specific approach, and a recent state-of-the-art deep learning method MammoRegNet. The implementations were adapted to this modality from the authors' implementations or re-implemented from scratch. Our contributions are: (1) the first public dataset of this scale with manual landmarks and masks for mammography registration; (2) the first like-for-like comparison of diverse methods on this modality; and (3) an extensive analysis of deep learning-based registration. We publicly release our code and data to establish a foundational resource for fair comparisons and catalyze future research.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于旋转和翻转一致性约束的半监督方法，适用于多输出（分支式）分割网络，在ImageTBDA数据集上显著提升了TL/FL/FLT分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取3D医学图像的精确标注昂贵且稀缺，尤其是存在病理不平衡（如68/32的FL分布）。为提高多输出分割模型在标签稀缺情况下的性能，设计无需概率假设的半监督一致性方法，兼容分支式架构。

Method: 分析方法: 本文提出一种针对多输出分割模型的半监督学习方法，基于额外的旋转和翻转数据增强以及一致性约束，不依赖于输出的概率解释。训练时使用带标签和无标签的3D CTA图像，通过对无标签图像施加几何变换并让模型在不同变换下输出保持一致，来利用无标签数据。模型结构为共享编码器+多分支解码器，每个分支分别进行类（TL、FL、FLT）分割。

Result: 在ImageTBDA数据集上进行实验（100例3D CTA，68例含FL），与仅用监督学习的基线相比，半监督方法在TL、FL和整体Dice系数上均有显著提升，尤其在缺少标签的情况下提升更明显。方法对检测FLT（稀少类）表现尤为稳健。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能在不依赖概率输出的前提下有效利用无标签数据，提高多输出分割模型的性能，适用于需要分离分支预测的医学图像分割任务，如TBAD。该方法通用且易于实现。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for multi-class segmentation of medical images are widely used today. Especially models with multiple outputs that can separately predict segmentation classes (regions) without relying on a probabilistic formulation of the segmentation of regions. These models allow for more precise segmentation by tailoring the network's components to each class (region). They have a common encoder part of the architecture but branch out at the output layers, leading to improved accuracy.
  These methods are used to diagnose type B aortic dissection (TBAD), which requires accurate segmentation of aortic structures based on the ImageTBDA dataset, which contains 100 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. These images identify three key classes: true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) of the aorta, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment decisions. In the dataset, 68 examples have a false lumen, while the remaining 32 do not, creating additional complexity for pathology detection.
  However, implementing these CNN methods requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data. Obtaining accurate labels for the regions of interest can be an expensive and time-consuming process, particularly for 3D data. Semi-supervised learning methods allow models to be trained by using both labeled and unlabeled data, which is a promising approach for overcoming the challenge of obtaining accurate labels. However, these learning methods are not well understood for models with multiple outputs.
  This paper presents a semi-supervised learning method for models with multiple outputs. The method is based on the additional rotations and flipping, and does not assume the probabilistic nature of the model's responses. This makes it a universal approach, which is especially important for architectures that involve separate segmentation.

Method: 将超分辨率建模为贝叶斯MAP推断，最小化两项不一致：合成的高分辨率加权图与实际加权图通过前向信号模型的差异，以及下采样预测与采集的低分辨率qMRI的差异。用合成数据（从HR qMRI生成wMRI并模拟k空间降采样）训练深度神经网络，进行消融验证并在不同序列和体内数据上测试。

Result: Paper proposes physics-informed self-supervised qMRI super-resolution using HR weighted MRI guides, removing need for HR qMRI ground truth.

Conclusion: Framework enables training without HR qMRI by enforcing consistency with forward signal models and LR qMRI; synthetic training generalizes to real data and yields 1-min acquisitions comparable to 5-min references.

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) quantitative MRI (qMRI) relaxometry provides objective tissue characterization but remains clinically underutilized due to lengthy acquisition times. We propose a physics-informed, self-supervised framework for qMRI super-resolution that uses routinely acquired HR weighted MRI (wMRI) scans as guidance, thus, removing the necessity for HR qMRI ground truth during training. We formulate super-resolution as Bayesian maximum a posteriori inference, minimizing two discrepancies: (1) between HR images synthesized from super-resolved qMRI maps and acquired wMRI guides via forward signal models, and (2) between acquired LR qMRI and downsampled predictions. This physics-informed objective allows the models to learn from clinical wMRI without HR qMRI supervision. To validate the concept, we generate training data by synthesizing wMRI guides from HR qMRI using signal equations, then degrading qMRI resolution via k-space truncation. A deep neural network learns the super-resolution mapping. Ablation experiments demonstrate that T1-weighted images primarily enhance T1 maps, T2-weighted images improve T2 maps, and combined guidance optimally enhances all parameters simultaneously. Validation on independently acquired in-vivo data from a different qMRI sequence confirms cross-qMRI sequence generalizability. Models trained on synthetic data can produce super-resolved maps from a 1-minute acquisition with quality comparable to a 5-minute reference scan, leveraging the scanner-independent nature of relaxometry parameters. By decoupling training from HR qMRI requirement, our framework enables fast qMRI acquisitions enhanced via routine clinical images, offering a practical pathway for integrating quantitative relaxometry into clinical workflows with acceptable additional scan time.

Abstract: Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved notable progress in computational pathology (CPath), the gigapixel scale and spatial heterogeneity of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) continue to pose challenges for multimodal understanding. Existing alignment methods struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between textual descriptions and visual cues across thousands of patches from a slide, compromising their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding. By harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs), PathFLIP can seamlessly follow diverse clinical instructions and adapt to varied diagnostic contexts. Furthermore, it exhibits versatile capabilities across multiple paradigms, efficiently handling slide-level classification and retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathFLIP outperforms existing large-scale pathological VLMs on four representative benchmarks while requiring significantly less training data, paving the way for fine-grained, instruction-aware WSI interpretation in clinical practice.

Method: Reformulates HOI detection as open-vocabulary generation using MLLM with visual steering via CSC; extracts hybrid interaction representations and uses hybrid guidance loss combining language modeling and auxiliary classification.

Result: State-of-the-art closed-set performance and strong zero-shot generalization; unified discriminative perception and generative reasoning paradigm.

Conclusion: GRASP-HO bridges vision and MLLMs via lightweight Cognitive Steering Conduit and hybrid guidance, enabling open-world HOI detection with generative outputs while retaining discriminative grounding.

Abstract: Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs and the interactions between them. Existing methods operate under a closed-world assumption, treating the task as a classification problem over a small, predefined verb set, which struggles to generalize to the long-tail of unseen or ambiguous interactions in the wild. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem. To bridge the vision and cognitive, we first extract hybrid interaction representations, then design a lightweight learnable cognitive steering conduit (CSC) module to inject the fine-grained visual evidence into a frozen MLLM for effective reasoning. To address the supervision mismatch between classification-based HOI datasets and open-vocabulary generative models, we introduce a hybrid guidance strategy that coupling the language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss, enabling discriminative grounding without sacrificing generative flexibility. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art closed-set performance and strong zero-shot generalization, achieving a unified paradigm that seamlessly bridges discriminative perception and generative reasoning for open-world HOI detection.

Conclusion: ReCo通过在in-context生成阶段对编辑与非编辑区域建模约束，有效提升指令式视频编辑的精度和生成质量。

Abstract: The In-context generation paradigm recently has demonstrated strong power in instructional image editing with both data efficiency and synthesis quality. Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training. Extensive experiments conducted on four major instruction-based video editing tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposal.

Abstract: Computational measurement of human behavior from video has recently become feasible due to major advances in AI. These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap. It gives behavioral researchers access to robust, high-level behavioral metrics without requiring engineering expertise, and it provides computer scientists a practical mechanism for disseminating methods to domains where their impact is most needed. We expect that Bitbox will accelerate integration of computational behavioral measurement into behavioral, clinical, and mental health research. Bitbox has been designed from the beginning as a community-driven effort that will evolve through contributions from both method developers and domain scientists.

### [85] [Learning Spatio-Temporal Feature Representations for Video-Based Gaze Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17673)
*Alexandre Personnic,Mihai Bâce*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ST-Gaze：保留帧内空间序列并用时空递归融合人脸与眼部特征，在EVE数据集上实现SOTA，且证实帧内空间信息对性能至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频凝视估计需要同时建模帧内空间特征与帧间时序动态。已有方法在空间或时间上的特征聚合上存在妥协，尤其是过早的空间池化会丢失有价值的帧内上下文，限制时序建模效果。作者旨在设计一种能在保留空间上下文的同时有效建模时序的方法。

Method: 设计ST-Gaze：以CNN提取眼部与人脸特征，使用通道注意力和自注意力模块对两路特征进行融合，生成保持空间结构的特征图，随后将该特征图视为空间序列应用帧内递归（intra-frame recurrence）以编码局部空间上下文，再将结果在时间维度上递归传播以捕捉帧间动态，最终进行凝视角度回归。

Result: 在EVE数据集上，ST-Gaze在无个体适配与有个体适配两种设置下均达到或超越现有SOTA；消融实验显示：1) 通道注意力与自注意力的融合有贡献；2) 在池化前保留并建模帧内空间上下文比提前池化更优；整体提高了凝视估计精度与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了ST-Gaze，一种结合CNN骨干、通道注意力与自注意力模块的时空凝视估计网络，通过在帧内保留空间序列并跨帧递归建模时序，显著提升视频凝视估计性能，尤其在EVE数据集上达到或超越SOTA，且消融实验表明保留帧内空间上下文优于过早的空间池化。

Abstract: Video-based gaze estimation methods aim to capture the inherently temporal dynamics of human eye gaze from multiple image frames. However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling. As such, our results pave the way towards more robust video-based gaze estimation using commonly available cameras.

### [86] [An Empirical Study of Sampling Hyperparameters in Diffusion-Based Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17675)
*Yudhistira Arief Wibowo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在使用DPS/MCG等条件化方法对预训练无条件扩散模型做超分辨率时，调节条件化步长比调整扩散步数更重要，最佳步长约为2.0–3.0。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型作为强大的无条件先验可用于逆问题重建，但现有条件化方法引入了需调节的超参数，实务中需明确哪些参数最影响最终性能以降低调参负担。

Method: 在FFHQ超分辨率基准上对DPS和MCG等条件化方法进行系统消融实验，独立改变条件化步长和扩散步骤数，比较PSNR/LPIPS等重建指标，分析二者对重建质量的相对影响。

Result: 实验显示，条件化步长的选择对重建结果影响最大；在广泛测试的配置中，较大步长（约2.0–3.0）通常能显著提升性能，而增加扩散步骤数带来的改进较小。

Conclusion: 本文通过在FFHQ超分辨率任务上的消融研究，发现对预训练扩散模型进行条件化时，关键超参数是条件化步长（conditioning step size），其对重建质量的影响远大于扩散步骤数；在实验中，条件化步长在[2.0,3.0]范围内表现最佳。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong potential for solving inverse problems such as single-image super-resolution, where a high-resolution image is recovered from a low-resolution observation using a pretrained unconditional prior. Conditioning methods, including Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) and Manifold Constrained Gradient (MCG), can substantially improve reconstruction quality, but they introduce additional hyperparameters that require careful tuning. In this work, we conduct an empirical ablation study on FFHQ super-resolution to identify the dominant factors affecting performance when applying conditioning to pretrained diffusion models, and show that the conditioning step size has a significantly greater impact than the diffusion step count, with step sizes in the range of [2.0, 3.0] yielding the best overall performance in our experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从单张或稀疏图像重建高保真可动画3D头部面具时，依赖相机位姿、表达标签或大量多视角数据的限制，导致泛化性差、难以捕捉罕见表情细节（如皱纹、露齿）和实时生成动态形变的挑战。作者旨在提出一种无需相机位姿和表达标签、对输入数量和视角灵活的重建方案，并能实时生成高细节的动态形变。

Method: 核心是一个基于Transformer的重建模型：使用结构化的“头部查询tokens”作为规范化锚点，将任意数量的输入图像（不需相机姿态或表达标签）聚合为稳健的规范3D表示。为表达相关的细节形变，引入一个以UV空间位置图为条件的轻量UNet解码器，能实时输出基于表情的微观形变。训练中采用数据分布调整策略，增强罕见但关键表情样本比例以学习皱纹和露齿等细节。此外，提供一个10秒的轻量身份微调步骤，用于提升极端身份的个性化细节，同时不影响形变质量。

Result: 广泛实验证明，FlexAvatar在3D一致性和动态细节真实感方面优于先前方法；模型可从单张或稀疏图像恢复高保真头部，并实时生成细节形变。数据分布调整和快速微调能显著改善罕见表情与极端身份的还原。

Conclusion: FlexAvatar提供了一个实用且灵活的可动画3D头像重建方案：无需相机位姿或表达标签、输入数量可变且支持实时细节形变，同时通过训练策略和快速微调提升对罕见表情与极端身份的表现，适合实际应用中的头像创建与动画化。

Abstract: We present FlexAvatar, a flexible large reconstruction model for high-fidelity 3D head avatars with detailed dynamic deformation from single or sparse images, without requiring camera poses or expression labels. It leverages a transformer-based reconstruction model with structured head query tokens as canonical anchor to aggregate flexible input-number-agnostic, camera-pose-free and expression-free inputs into a robust canonical 3D representation. For detailed dynamic deformation, we introduce a lightweight UNet decoder conditioned on UV-space position maps, which can produce detailed expression-dependent deformations in real time. To better capture rare but critical expressions like wrinkles and bared teeth, we also adopt a data distribution adjustment strategy during training to balance the distribution of these expressions in the training set. Moreover, a lightweight 10-second refinement can further enhances identity-specific details in extreme identities without affecting deformation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FlexAvatar achieves superior 3D consistency, detailed dynamic realism compared with previous methods, providing a practical solution for animatable 3D avatar creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAVeD是一个从社交媒体视频构建的大规模ADAS车辆事故和未遂事件数据集，包含2119个第一人称视频并含帧级碰撞、规避、失能标注；文章提出基于语义分割与单目深度估计的实时TTC计算、用广义极值分布建模极端风险、并在VLLM上建立域适应基准，显示细粒度标注可提升近失事景下模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏真实ADAS车辆在高风险边缘情形（近失、失能、碰撞）下的行为记录，多为模拟或人为驾驶数据，不足以支持安全关键研究与模型鲁棒性评估。作者通过社媒视频填补这一空白，提供真实、丰富、且带边缘事件的视觉数据。

Method: 构建SAVeD数据集：收集并筛选2119条第一视角社媒视频，按位置、光照、天气等多样性进行整理，逐帧标注碰撞、规避动作与系统失能。提出基于语义分割与单目深度估计的实时TTC计算框架，用GEV分布对不同路型的极端风险进行建模，并在VideoLLaMA2与InternVL2.5 HiCo R16等VLLM上进行域适应与基准测试。

Result: SAVeD提供丰富边缘事件样本，TTC框架可在动态物体上估算实时碰撞威胁，GEV分析揭示不同路型的极端风险差异；通过在SAVeD上做域适应，VLLMs在处理复杂近失场景时性能明显提升，验证了细粒度标注的效用。

Conclusion: SAVeD为ADAS安全研究提供了重要的现实世界数据资源与分析工具，提出的方法与基准为感知、决策故障分析和模型鲁棒性提升提供了可复现路径。

Abstract: The advancement of safety-critical research in driving behavior in ADAS-equipped vehicles require real-world datasets that not only include diverse traffic scenarios but also capture high-risk edge cases such as near-miss events and system failures. However, existing datasets are largely limited to either simulated environments or human-driven vehicle data, lacking authentic ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) vehicle behavior under risk conditions. To address this gap, this paper introduces SAVeD, a large-scale video dataset curated from publicly available social media content, explicitly focused on ADAS vehicle-related crashes, near-miss incidents, and disengagements. SAVeD features 2,119 first-person videos, capturing ADAS vehicle operations in diverse locations, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios. The dataset includes video frame-level annotations for collisions, evasive maneuvers, and disengagements, enabling analysis of both perception and decision-making failures. We demonstrate SAVeD's utility through multiple analyses and contributions: (1) We propose a novel framework integrating semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation to compute real-time Time-to-Collision (TTC) for dynamic objects. (2) We utilize the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to model and quantify the extreme risk in crash and near-miss events across different roadway types. (3) We establish benchmarks for state-of-the-art VLLMs (VideoLLaMA2 and InternVL2.5 HiCo R16), showing that SAVeD's detailed annotations significantly enhance model performance through domain adaptation in complex near-miss scenarios.

### [89] [MambaMIL+: Modeling Long-Term Contextual Patterns for Gigapixel Whole Slide Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17726)
*Qian Zeng,Yihui Wang,Shu Yang,Yingxue Xu,Fengtao Zhou,Jiabo Ma,Dejia Cai,Zhengyu Zhang,Lijuan Qu,Yu Wang,Li Liang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MambaMIL+：在Mamba上加入重叠扫描、S2PE和CTS，以增强WSI的空间上下文建模与长程稳定记忆，在20个基准上对多任务均显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI具有超大分辨率和缺乏精细标注的特点，常规深度学习难以直接处理；MIL能将WSI视为补丁袋但难以对超长序列与丰富的空间上下文同时建模；Mamba虽能处理长序列但在空间连续性与记忆保持方面有缺陷，限制了其在WSI分析中的效果。

Method: MambaMIL+包含三大贡献：1) 重叠扫描：通过对补丁序列进行重叠滑动扫描重构输入序列，以显式嵌入空间连续性和实例间相关性；2) 选择性条形位置编码器(S2PE)：采用条状位置编码并结合选择机制，减少固定扫描顺序带来的位置偏差；3) 上下文令牌选择(CTS)：利用监督信息动态选择并扩展上下文令牌作为记忆，增强长程依赖建模并避免记忆遗忘。

Result: 在20个基准（诊断分类、分子预测、生存分析）上进行大量实验，使用三种特征提取器(ResNet-50、PLIP、CONCH)进行评估，结果显示MambaMIL+在所有任务和特征器上均稳定取得或超越SOTA的性能，验证了其有效性与稳健性。

Conclusion: MambaMIL+通过在Mamba的长序列基础上加入重叠扫描、选择性条形位置编码器(S2PE)和上下文令牌选择(CTS)三项改进，显著增强了对WSI空间上下文的建模和长期依赖的稳定记忆，解决了原始Mamba在空间信息建模和记忆衰减上的不足，从而在多项病理任务上取得了SOTA性能。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) are an important data modality in computational pathology, yet their gigapixel resolution and lack of fine-grained annotations challenge conventional deep learning models. Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出利用CLIP进行通用深度伪造检测。构建了大规模扩散生成数据集Diff-Gen(10万图)；提出AdaptPrompt，冻结CLIP主干，联合学习文本prompt和视觉adapter；剪枝视觉编码器末层保留高频伪造痕迹。实验证明在25个测试集上在标准与跨域检测上均达SOTA，并支持少量样本泛化与来源归属。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测器在训练于有限生成器时泛化性差，尤其扩散模型产生的高保真伪造与GAN不同，需要更广泛的数据与更强的特征利用策略以提升跨域检测能力。

Method: (1) 构建Diff-Gen，大量扩散模型生成图像，强调光谱/高频伪造痕迹；(2) AdaptPrompt：冻结CLIP视觉-文本大模型，只学习任务文本prompt与轻量视觉adapter以高效迁移；(3) 进一步通过层级消融发现剪掉视觉编码器最后一个transformer block能更好保留高频伪造信号，提高检测效果。

Result: 在25个测试集（含GAN、扩散、商用工具生成的图像）上实验表明：使用Diff-Gen训练的模型跨域泛化显著优于传统GAN数据训练；AdaptPrompt在标准与跨域检测上达新SOTA；在仅320张样本的few-shot情形还能保持良好性能；同时可做闭集源归属识别。

Conclusion: 通过引入覆盖扩散模型伪造特性的Diff-Gen与参数高效的AdaptPrompt框架，结合对视觉编码器末层的剪枝，可显著提升深度伪造检测的跨域泛化与少样本适应能力，并支持来源识别，推动更实用的检测方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation have led to the widespread availability of highly realistic synthetic media, increasing the difficulty of reliable deepfake detection. A key challenge is generalization, as detectors trained on a narrow class of generators often fail when confronted with unseen models. In this work, we address the pressing need for generalizable detection by leveraging large vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to identify synthetic content across diverse generative techniques. First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the framework's versatility through few-shot generalization (using as few as 320 images) and source attribution, enabling the precise identification of generator architectures in closed-set settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用预训练的几何感知ViT直接回归NPHM参数，结合SDF监督与法线伪标签训练，支持实时重建与推理时优化，提升面部几何细节与泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于网格的3DMM难以表达高频面部几何细节，且将神经参数化头模型（NPHM）拟合至图像困难，需设计直接回归方法以稳定估计高维隐空间。

Method: 设计Pix2NPHM：以域适配的ViT为骨干，输入单张图像输出NPHM参数；混合训练数据包括100K+ NPHM注册的3D数据（SDF监督）和大规模视频（法线伪标签）；并提供推理时基于法线与规范点映射的优化以提升细节。

Result: Pix2NPHM提出了一种基于ViT的端到端方法，将单张图像直接回归到NPHM参数，从而实现高保真面部几何重建。通过在SDF空间上的直接监督以及利用大量二维视频数据的法线伪标签，方法兼顾了三维细节与广泛泛化能力。同时支持推理时通过法线与点云图做进一步优化以提升几何精度。

Conclusion: Pix2NPHM在面部重建质量和速度上均表现优异，能够在野外数据上大规模运行，并通过后处理优化进一步提高细节，优于传统3DMM基线。

Abstract: Neural Parametric Head Models (NPHMs) are a recent advancement over mesh-based 3d morphable models (3DMMs) to facilitate high-fidelity geometric detail. However, fitting NPHMs to visual inputs is notoriously challenging due to the expressive nature of their underlying latent space. To this end, we propose Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer (ViT) network that directly regresses NPHM parameters, given a single image as input. Compared to existing approaches, the neural parametric space allows our method to reconstruct more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions. For broad generalization, we exploit domain-specific ViTs as backbones, which are pretrained on geometric prediction tasks. We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps. As a result, we achieve unprecedented face reconstruction quality that can run at scale on in-the-wild data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入LiteGE，一种轻量级方法，通过在信息性体素上对无符号距离场（UDF）采样并做PCA，构建紧凑的类别感知形状描述子，实现对三维表面测地距离的高效估计；在稀疏点云（最低300点）上仍然稳健，显著降低内存和推理时间（最多300×），并在形状匹配任务上提供高达1000×的加速，同时保持与先进网格方法相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法虽然性能好，但依赖大型3D网络，导致高内存占用和高延迟，不适用于交互式或资源受限场景。需要一种轻量且鲁棒的方法，能在稀疏点云上工作，并加速测地距离估计与形状匹配。

Method: 提出LiteGE：在信息性体素上采样UDF值，对采样向量应用PCA以获得紧凑的类别感知描述子，避免使用高容量神经网络。描述子可从稀疏点云重建；推理阶段直接利用描述子进行测地距离估计与形状匹配。

Result: 在大量实验中，LiteGE在内存使用和推理时间上相较现有神经方法最高减少300×；在形状匹配任务上，相较最先进的基于网格方法最高加速达1000×，同时在非等距形变和点云输入上保持可比的准确性。方法在点数低至300的稀疏输入上依旧稳健。

Conclusion: LiteGE通过结合UDF采样与PCA构建轻量且高效的形状描述子，显著降低计算资源需求并实现快速精确的测地距离估计和形状匹配，适合交互式和资源受限场景。

Abstract: Computing geodesic distances on 3D surfaces is fundamental to many tasks in 3D vision and geometry processing, with deep connections to tasks such as shape correspondence. Recent learning-based methods achieve strong performance but rely on large 3D backbones, leading to high memory usage and latency, which limit their use in interactive or resource-constrained settings. We introduce LiteGE, a lightweight approach that constructs compact, category-aware shape descriptors by applying PCA to unsigned distance field (UDFs) samples at informative voxels. This descriptor is efficient to compute and removes the need for high-capacity networks. LiteGE remains robust on sparse point clouds, supporting inputs with as few as 300 points, where prior methods fail. Extensive experiments show that LiteGE reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 300$\times$ compared to existing neural approaches. In addition, by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between geodesic distance and shape correspondence, LiteGE enables fast and accurate shape matching. Our method achieves up to 1000$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy on non-isometric shape pairs, including evaluations on point-cloud inputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UrbanDIFF，一种基于去噪扩散模型的纯空间LST重建方法，利用静态城市结构信息并在推理时通过像素引导精炼强制保持云外像素一致性，在高云覆盖（高达85%）下对MODIS LST数据进行重建，表现优于插值基线（SSIM 0.89、RMSE 1.2K、R2 0.84）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云遮挡导致卫星LST观测不连续，现有多时相/多传感器方法依赖辅助观测不可用时失效，传统空间填充方法与主流深度模型在大面积缺失时性能下降，因此需要对高缺失率更鲁棒的纯空间重建方法。

Method: 提出UrbanDIFF：纯空间去噪扩散型图像修复模型，条件输入包括建筑覆盖和数字高程等静态城市结构数据，并在推理阶段加入有监督的像素引导精炼以严格保持非遮挡像素不变。模型在七个美国大都市（2002–2025）的MODIS Terra LST数据上训练与评估，使用合成云掩膜（20%–85%覆盖）测试。

Result: 在20%–85%云覆盖范围内，UrbanDIFF持续优于插值基线，尤其在高云覆盖下优势明显。在85%云覆盖时，取得SSIM 0.89、RMSE 1.2 K、R2 0.84，并且随着云密度增加性能下降速度更慢。

Conclusion: 去噪扩散型纯空间模型结合静态城市结构条件与像素级一致性约束，可显著提升在高云遮挡场景下的城市LST重建质量，为SUHI长期监测提供更鲁棒的数据填补方案。

Abstract: Satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) products are central to surface urban heat island (SUHI) monitoring due to their consistent grid-based coverage over large metropolitan regions. However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness.
  Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference.
  UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.

Abstract: Accurate camera models are essential for photogrammetry applications such as 3D mapping and object localization, particularly for long distances. Various stereo-camera based 3D localization methods are available but are limited to few hundreds of meters' range. This is majorly due to the limitation of the distortion models assumed for the non-linearities present in the camera lens. This paper presents a framework for modeling a suitable distortion model that can be used for localizing the objects at longer distances. It is well known that neural networks can be a better alternative to model a highly complex non-linear lens distortion function; on contrary, it is observed that a direct application of neural networks to distortion models fails to converge to estimate the camera parameters. To resolve this, a hybrid approach is presented in this paper where the conventional distortion models are initially extended to incorporate higher-order terms and then enhanced using neural network based residual correction model. This hybrid approach has substantially improved long-range localization performance and is capable of estimating the 3D position of objects at distances up to 5 kilometres. The estimated 3D coordinates are transformed to GIS coordinates and are plotted on a GIS map for visualization. Experimental validation demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of proposed framework, offering a practical solution to calibrate CCTV cameras for long-range photogrammetry applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AniX，一种在给定3D场景与角色下通过自然语言指令生成时序连贯、高保真视频的系统，扩展了可控实体模型以支持开放式、多样化的角色行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出将静态世界生成与可控实体模型结合，允许用户指定角色在3D场景内进行开放式动作控制，弥补现有方法在动作多样性和环境可控性上的不足。

Method: 设计AniX框架：以条件自回归视频生成为形式，输入为3DGS场景、角色和自然语言指令。基于预训练视频生成器，提出训练策略以增强运动动态，同时保持对动作与角色的泛化能力，生成与场景和角色一致且时序连贯的视频片段。

Result: 在视觉质量、角色一致性、动作可控性和长时序连贯性等多方面取得良好表现，能够实现从基本移动到以物体为中心的交互等多样化行为并保持场景与角色的保真度。

Conclusion: AniX成功融合静态世界生成的真实感与结构性约束与可控实体的动作自定义性，提供一种可通过自然语言指导角色在真实场景中自由探索并执行开放式动作的可行方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in world models have greatly enhanced interactive environment simulation. Existing methods mainly fall into two categories: (1) static world generation models, which construct 3D environments without active agents, and (2) controllable-entity models, which allow a single entity to perform limited actions in an otherwise uncontrollable environment. In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment. AniX synthesizes temporally coherent video clips that preserve visual fidelity with the provided scene and character, formulated as a conditional autoregressive video generation problem. Built upon a pre-trained video generator, our training strategy significantly enhances motion dynamics while maintaining generalization across actions and characters. Our evaluation covers a broad range of aspects, including visual quality, character consistency, action controllability, and long-horizon coherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Chorus，一种多教师蒸馏框架，用于从3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）原语中学习通用、前馈式的场景编码器，通过多个2D基础模型提供互补信号，提升语义到细粒度结构的表征能力，实验包括零样本分割、线性/解码探针及数据高效微调，且在点云基准上表现优秀并显著降低训练场景需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3DGS作为高保真场景表示已被提出，但直接从其原语（高斯）学习丰富、通用的特征尚未充分研究。作者希望构建一个能从2D基础模型中蒸馏多种互补监督信号的3D编码器，以获得兼顾高层语义与细粒度结构的通用表征，进而提升下游任务性能与数据效率。

Method: 提出Chorus：使用共享的3D编码器和针对每个教师的projector从多位2D教师（语言对齐模型、通用模型、面向目标的模型）蒸馏特征。训练时对每个教师使用专门的投影头，但保持编码器共享，鼓励输出共享嵌入空间包含从语义到细节的多尺度信号。还提出一种render-and-distill的适配策略用于域外微调；对仅支持点云的基准，训练一个仅使用高斯中心、颜色和估计法线的变体。

Result: 在多个任务上评估：开放词汇语义和实例分割、线性与解码器探测、以及数据高效监督。Chorus在3DGS和点云基准上均有强转移能力，尤其是仅用高斯中心等信息训练的变体，以39.9倍更少的训练场景超越点云基线。提出的render-and-distill有助于域外微调。

Conclusion: Chorus证明了通过多教师蒸馏可以从3DGS学习到丰富且通用的场景表征，既能兼顾高层语义也保留细粒度结构，实现对多种下游任务的迁移和数据高效性，且对仅有点云输入的场景也表现优秀。将开源代码与模型。

Abstract: While 3DGS has emerged as a high-fidelity scene representation, encoding rich, general-purpose features directly from its primitives remains under-explored. We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.
  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs. Interestingly, this encoder shows strong transfer and outperforms the point clouds baseline while using 39.9 times fewer training scenes. Finally, we propose a render-and-distill adaptation that facilitates out-of-domain finetuning. Our code and model will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: ReX-MLE: 20 medical imaging challenges testing full workflows; SOTA agents largely fail, ranking near 0th percentile vs humans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based coding agent benchmarks don't measure full end-to-end capabilities needed for domain-specific scientific tasks like medical imaging; need realistic evaluation.

Method: Created 20 challenges from medical imaging competitions; required agents to handle preprocessing, training, submission under realistic compute/time; evaluated several agents with different LLM backends and analyzed failures.

Result: ReX-MLE benchmark introduced; evaluates end-to-end medical imaging workflows; tested agents performed poorly.

Conclusion: Current autonomous coding agents fail on complex medical imaging tasks due to domain knowledge and engineering gaps; ReX-MLE highlights need for domain-aware agents.

Abstract: Autonomous coding agents built on large language models (LLMs) can now solve many general software and machine learning tasks, but they remain ineffective on complex, domain-specific scientific problems. Medical imaging is a particularly demanding domain, requiring long training cycles, high-dimensional data handling, and specialized preprocessing and validation pipelines, capabilities not fully measured in existing agent benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce ReX-MLE, a benchmark of 20 challenges derived from high-impact medical imaging competitions spanning diverse modalities and task types. Unlike prior ML-agent benchmarks, ReX-MLE evaluates full end-to-end workflows, requiring agents to independently manage data preprocessing, model training, and submission under realistic compute and time constraints. Evaluating state-of-the-art agents (AIDE, ML-Master, R&D-Agent) with different LLM backends (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude), we observe a severe performance gap: most submissions rank in the 0th percentile compared to human experts. Failures stem from domain-knowledge and engineering limitations. ReX-MLE exposes these bottlenecks and provides a foundation for developing domain-aware autonomous AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfSplign是一种无需训练的推理时方法，通过在每步去噪中调整噪声并使用多层跨注意力图的复合损失，改善文本-图像空间对齐，显著超越现有基线并兼容任意扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I扩散模型常常无法准确反映文本提示中指定的空间关系，原因在于训练数据缺乏细粒度空间监督以及文本嵌入不能充分编码空间语义。为了解决这一问题，需要一种无需重新训练且能在推理时纠正生成过程的方法。

Method: InfSplign在每个去噪步骤应用一个复合损失，该损失利用解码器不同层的跨注意力图来约束目标位置（通过对齐注意力高响应区域与目标盒/掩码）和保证对象存在性的平衡（避免对象缺失或重复）。方法通过调整当前噪声以最小化复合损失来引导采样轨迹，无需修改模型参数且可与任意扩散骨干网络配合。

Result: 在VISOR和T2I-CompBench上，InfSplign在空间对齐和对象放置度量上取得领先，较最强的推理时基线有显著提升，并且在若干场景下优于需要微调的方案；实现轻量、兼容且开源。

Conclusion: InfSplign在推理阶段通过对每个去噪步骤施加复合损失、利用多层跨注意力图来约束对象位置和存在性，显著提升了T2I扩散模型的空间对齐性，在两个评测集上优于现有推理时和微调方法，且为轻量级、即插即用方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models generate high-quality images but often fail to capture the spatial relations specified in text prompts. This limitation can be traced to two factors: lack of fine-grained spatial supervision in training data and inability of text embeddings to encode spatial semantics. We introduce InfSplign, a training-free inference-time method that improves spatial alignment by adjusting the noise through a compound loss in every denoising step. Proposed loss leverages different levels of cross-attention maps extracted from the backbone decoder to enforce accurate object placement and a balanced object presence during sampling. The method is lightweight, plug-and-play, and compatible with any diffusion backbone. Our comprehensive evaluations on VISOR and T2I-CompBench show that InfSplign establishes a new state-of-the-art (to the best of our knowledge), achieving substantial performance gains over the strongest existing inference-time baselines and even outperforming the fine-tuning-based methods. Codebase is available at GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raman spectroscopy has high specificity for molecular analysis but is limited by weak Raman signals and strong fluorescence background in biological tissues, reducing diagnostic utility. The paper aims to overcome these limitations by improving signal quality under fluorescence-dominated conditions.

Method: They developed a statistically grounded noise model capturing major noise sources, generated realistic simulated Raman spectra based on this model, and trained a cascaded deep neural network to jointly remove stochastic detector noise and fluorescence baseline interference.

Result: Using simulated human skin spectra derived from real experimental data as validation, the framework improved spectral quality—suppressing detector noise and fluorescence baseline—demonstrating enhanced Raman-based tissue analysis performance.

Conclusion: Physics-informed, simulation-driven deep learning can effectively denoise fluorescence-dominated Raman spectra, potentially enabling faster and more accurate tissue diagnostics.

Abstract: Raman spectroscopy enables non-destructive, label-free molecular analysis with high specificity, making it a powerful tool for biomedical diagnostics. However, its application to biological tissues is challenged by inherently weak Raman scattering and strong fluorescence background, which significantly degrade signal quality. In this study, we present a simulation-driven denoising framework that combines a statistically grounded noise model with deep learning to enhance Raman spectra acquired under fluorescence-dominated conditions. We comprehensively modeled major noise sources. Based on this model, we generated biologically realistic Raman spectra and used them to train a cascaded deep neural network designed to jointly suppress stochastic detector noise and fluorescence baseline interference. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we simulated human skin spectra derived from real experimental data as a validation case study. Our results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed learning to improve spectral quality and enable faster, more accurate Raman-based tissue analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型将数据扩散到白噪声再重构，导致预测任务非常困难且计算不可行。作者认为保持某些频谱不变可以简化任务并保留重要特征。

Method: 提出InSPECT：在前向过程使傅里叶系数平滑收敛到指定随机噪声，同时保留若干不变频谱特征；在反向过程保持这些不变特征以简化重建任务，从而提高生成质量和收敛速度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、Celeb-A和LSUN上，InSPECT在10K迭代下平均比DDPM减少39.23% FID，IS提升45.80%，表明生成质量和多样性显著提升且更快收敛。

Conclusion: 通过分析并保持不变频谱特征，InSPECT显著改善了扩散模型的性能，是首个在扩散模型中引入频谱不变特征的工作。

Abstract: Modern diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However, the fundamental design choice of diffusing data all the way to white noise and then reconstructing it leads to an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to analyze and preserve invariant spectral features in diffusion models.

TL;DR: 视觉提示评估对标记细节和低级设置极其敏感，能重排模型排行榜；作者发布VPBench（16种标记变体）以提高评估鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的评估需能区分模型基于视觉信息的理解能力与文本先验。视觉提示是一种常用方法，但若评估对提示细节敏感，会误导对模型视觉能力的判断，影响公平比较。作者因此研究这些敏感性并提出更稳健的基准。

Method: 作者在两个视觉提示任务上，对九个常用的开源与闭源VLM进行评估，系统地修改视觉标记（颜色、大小等）与可控低级推理参数（如JPEG压缩），比较模型在不同设置下的性能与排行变化；并基于现有数据集整理出VPBench，包含16种视觉标记变体以测试鲁棒性。

Result: 该论文展示了视觉提示（visual prompting）评估在视觉语言模型（VLM）中易受视觉标记细节影响的脆弱性。作者通过系统实验揭示：微小的标注设计变化（颜色、大小等）和低级推理设置（例如JPEG压缩）能显著改变模型在排行榜上的排序，并能利用这些变化让较弱模型超越更强模型。为解决不稳定性问题，作者整理并扩展现有数据集，发布了包含16种视觉标记变体的VPBench基准与分析工具。

Conclusion: 视觉提示基准对视觉标记设计和推理参数高度敏感，目前流行的VLM评估结果可能被这些表面因素扭曲。为获得更可靠的比较，研究者应在评估中考虑多种标记变体和推理设置，使用像VPBench这样的更全面基准。

Abstract: A key challenge in evaluating VLMs is testing models' ability to analyze visual content independently from their textual priors. Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations. To mitigate this instability, we curate existing datasets to create VPBench, a larger visually prompted benchmark with 16 visual marker variants. VPBench and additional analysis tools are released at https://lisadunlap.github.io/vpbench/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SEMs need complex training and architectures; ViT foundation models make this impractical so a method to provide transparency without retraining is needed

Method: Extract method from abstract

Result: Propose KCCs turning ViT into SEMs without retraining by leveraging ViT keypoint matching to create interpretable decision via counting keypoints

Conclusion: KCCs improve human-machine communication and increase transparency/reliability for ViT foundation models

Abstract: Current approaches for designing self-explainable models (SEMs) require complicated training procedures and specific architectures which makes them impractical. With the advance of general purpose foundation models based on Vision Transformers (ViTs), this impracticability becomes even more problematic. Therefore, new methods are necessary to provide transparency and reliability to ViT-based foundation models. In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs). Recent works have shown that ViTs can automatically identify matching keypoints between images with high precision, and we build on these results to create an easily interpretable decision process that is inherently visualizable in the input. We perform an extensive evaluation which show that KCCs improve the human-machine communication compared to recent baselines. We believe that KCCs constitute an important step towards making ViT-based foundation models more transparent and reliable.

Conclusion: RadarGen 为跨传感器生成仿真提供了可扩展路径，展示了将视觉基线与雷达生成结合以改善多模态感知训练的潜力，推进统一生成仿真工具的发展。

Abstract: We present RadarGen, a diffusion model for synthesizing realistic automotive radar point clouds from multi-view camera imagery. RadarGen adapts efficient image-latent diffusion to the radar domain by representing radar measurements in bird's-eye-view form that encodes spatial structure together with radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler attributes. A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation. Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, marking a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities.

Abstract: Understanding and generating multi-person interactions is a fundamental challenge with broad implications for robotics and social computing. While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated. Project page: https://von31.github.io/MAGNet/

TL;DR: 本文评估了两个开源视觉语言模型（LLaVA-1.5-13B 与 Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2）在视觉输入上的对抗鲁棒性，采用 untargeted PGD 攻击并在 VQA v2 子集上测试。结果显示 Llama 3.2 Vision 在攻击下的性能下降小于 LLaVA，表明基准准确率高并不意味着对抗鲁棒性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型复杂度提高，理解模型如何识别图像变得困难，攻击者可通过在图像上添加不可见或细微扰动来误导模型。本研究旨在检验当前开源视觉语言模型在视觉模态上的对抗易受攻击性，以评估其在 VQA 任务中的稳健性。

Method: 对 LLaVA-1.5-13B 与 Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2 在 VQA v2 子集上的视觉输入施加 untargeted PGD 攻击（在像素空间对视觉模态求梯度并迭代生成扰动），并使用标准 VQA 准确率来量化攻击效果。比较两模型在不同扰动强度下的基线准确率与攻击后准确率的下降幅度。

Result: 实验表明 Llama 3.2 Vision 尽管基线准确率低于 LLaVA，但在更高扰动强度下性能下降更小；总体上对视觉模态的 PGD 攻击能显著降低两个模型的 VQA 准确率，验证了视觉模态是可行的攻击向量。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性与标准基准表现（如 VQA 正确率）不必然正相关，可能受架构设计与训练流程影响。研究强调需要在视觉模态上进一步增强 VLM 的稳健性，并在未来探究哪些因素（模型结构、训练数据、正则化、数据增强等）能提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the increase in deep learning, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the model in which AI systems can identify objects. Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision. Furthermore, they highlight that adversarial robustness does not necessarily correlate directly with standard benchmark performance and may be influenced by underlying architectural and training factors.

Conclusion: 提出的框架是基于视频扩散的交互式数字孪生的第一步，能够从第一人称动作实现具身仿真，为后续更复杂的交互提供基础。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has made it easy to create realistic digital twins from everyday environments. However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.
  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.
  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency. This framework represents a first step toward video diffusion-based interactive digital twins and enables embodied simulation from egocentric actions.

TL;DR: Re-Depth Anything refines DA-V2 depth at test-time using diffusion-based re-synthesis (SDS) and targeted optimization (freeze encoder, update embeddings and decoder) to exploit shape-from-shading cues, improving depth on diverse benchmarks.

Motivation: Monocular depth models like DA-V2 fail on out-of-distribution real images due to domain gap; leveraging powerful 2D generative priors at test time can provide additional geometric cues (e.g., shading) without labels.

Method: At test time, generate re-lit/augmented images from predicted depth and use Score Distillation Sampling with large 2D diffusion models to guide refinement. Optimization freezes encoder, updates intermediate embeddings and fine-tunes decoder to avoid collapse; use shape-from-shading cues instead of photometric reconstruction for self-supervision.

Result: The paper proposes Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that improves monocular depth estimation by combining DA-V2 with 2D diffusion model priors. It refines depth predictions by re-lighting and image augmentation, using Score Distillation Sampling to leverage shape-from-shading cues instead of classical photometric reconstruction, and updates only intermediate embeddings plus the decoder during optimization.

Conclusion: Targeted test-time self-supervision that fuses generative 2D priors with existing depth models can significantly improve depth accuracy and realism on out-of-distribution real-world images without full model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation remains challenging as recent foundation models, such as Depth Anything V2 (DA-V2), struggle with real-world images that are far from the training distribution. We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder. Across diverse benchmarks, Re-Depth Anything yields substantial gains in depth accuracy and realism over the DA-V2, showcasing new avenues for self-supervision by augmenting geometric reasoning.

Abstract: Modern Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) typically operate in low-level Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent spaces that are primarily optimized for pixel-level reconstruction. To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.

Abstract: Web applications underpin much of modern digital life, yet building scalable and consistent cloud applications remains difficult, requiring expertise across cloud computing, distributed systems, databases, and software engineering. These demands restrict development to a small number of highly specialized engineers. This thesis aims to democratize cloud application development by addressing three challenges: programmability, high-performance fault-tolerant serializable transactions, and serverless semantics.
  The thesis identifies strong parallels between cloud applications and the streaming dataflow execution model. It first explores this connection through T-Statefun, a transactional extension of Apache Flink Statefun, demonstrating that dataflow systems can support transactional cloud applications via a stateful functions-as-a-service API. However, this approach revealed significant limitations in programmability and performance.
  To overcome these issues, the thesis introduces Stateflow, a high-level object-oriented programming model that compiles applications into stateful dataflow graphs with minimal boilerplate. Building on this model, the thesis presents Styx, a distributed streaming dataflow engine that provides deterministic, multi-partition, serializable transactions with strong fault tolerance guarantees. Styx eliminates explicit transaction failure handling and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.
  Finally, the thesis extends Styx with transactional state migration to support elasticity under dynamic workloads.
