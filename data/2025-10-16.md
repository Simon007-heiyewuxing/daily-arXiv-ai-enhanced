*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SimULi，实现实时渲染任意相机模型与旋转LiDAR，通过分解3D高斯与锚定策略减少跨传感器误差，并在速度与精度上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界部署的自动驾驶系统需要高保真、多传感器的模拟环境来测试难以或危险采集的场景；现有NeRF/3DGS类方法要么速度慢、要么仅支持针孔相机、要么在多传感器一致性上表现不佳，无法满足自动驾驶仿真需求。

Method: 基于3DGUT扩展，新增对LiDAR的自动切片策略与射线剔除；引入分解的3D高斯表示和锚定策略以统一相机与深度模态；优化数据结构与渲染流程以实现实时性能，相比光线追踪与先前光栅化方法显著加速。

Result: SimULi是一种面向自动驾驶场景的实时多传感器模拟方法，支持任意相机模型与LiDAR渲染，扩展自支持复杂相机模型的3DGUT，并通过自动切片与基于射线的剔除实现任意旋转LiDAR的高效渲染；提出分解的3D高斯表示与锚定策略以缓解跨传感器不一致性，在相机与深度误差上较现有方法最多降低约40%；渲染速度比光线追踪快10-20倍，比先前基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍，同时在两个常用自动驾驶数据集上达到或超过现有最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi在多传感器模拟中兼顾速度与多模态一致性，适合自动驾驶仿真场景，既支持广泛相机模型与LiDAR，又在精度和渲染速度上领先。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将手术未来预测重构为状态变化分类，SurgFUTR用教师-学生结构与聚类状态表示统一解决短/长期任务，在多数据集、多术式上提升性能并具备迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高手术室安全性与效率，通过实时AI预测手术未来状态，提供即将发生事件、时间和风险的可操作性洞见，便于资源分配、器械准备和并发症预警。

Method: 采用Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类将视频片段编码为离散状态；教师网络学习当前与未来状态，学生网络仅用当前视频预测未来状态；Action Dynamics模块建模动作演化并用于指导学生；建立SFPBench包含五个预测任务，进行了跨数据集和跨术式实验验证。

Result: 提出SurgFUTR框架，通过将未来预测视为状态变化学习，实现对短期（动作三元组、事件）与长期（剩余手术时长、阶段/步骤转换）任务的统一预测；引入Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类压缩视频为状态表示，采用教师-学生架构和Action Dynamics模块指导学生仅从当前视频预测未来状态，在四个数据集与三种手术上均有稳定提升，并证明跨术式迁移能力。

Conclusion: 状态变化学习为手术未来预测提供更鲁棒和通用的范式；SurgFUTR在多任务和跨术式场景中表现优越，细粒度动作三元组等得到更好建模，胜过基于特征预测的方法。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TMPS：在有少量目标域样本下用优先采样结合度量学习显著提升植物病害诊断的跨域鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物病害诊断模型在训练环境外的图像上泛化能力差，主要因病害症状微妙且训练数据多样性不足导致域差异和性能下降。需要一种能在目标域仅有少量标注样本时，提升模型稳健性的可适配方法。

Method: 基于度量学习框架，提出Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS)。利用少量目标域有标注样本构建优先采样策略，加强目标域样本在训练中的影响力，并在嵌入空间对类别结构进行约束以提升判别性。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像、23个农业地块、21种病害及健康样本的数据集上实验。仅每类加入10张目标域样本，TMPS在平均宏F1上分别比混合训练和先预训练再微调提升7.3和3.6点，并较基线和传统度量学习分别提升18.7和17.1点。

Conclusion: TMPS在有限目标域标注样本下通过度量学习和优先采样有效提升了模型在新域上的诊断鲁棒性，显著优于混合训练和传统微调方法。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

### [4] [Unifying Vision-Language Latents for Zero-label Image Caption Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12931)
*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一种在无文本标签下通过对齐视觉-语言特征来提升图像描述生成的训练框架，能在不依赖人工注释和不完全重训的条件下使VLM生成更具体、扎根的字幕。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模图像-文本预训练模型受限于标注数据，导致大量未标注图像数据未被充分利用，研究旨在实现零标签学习以扩展VLM的可扩展性和实用性。

Method: 提出Unified Vision-Language Alignment for Zero-Label Enhancement（ViZer），在训练过程中对视觉与语言表示进行对齐，避免依赖人工或合成注释数据，通过增强表示一致性来改善无标签情况下的图像字幕生成。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上应用ViZer后，观察到定性一致性改进：生成的描述比基线更具扎根性和描述性；自动评测指标（如CIDEr、BERTScore）可能不能完全反映这些改进，因为参考描述中缺失细节会惩罚模型生成的额外信息。

Conclusion: ViZer通过在训练期间主动对齐视觉与语言特征，实现了无需图像文本标签即可提升图像描述生成质量的零标签增强框架，能够在不完全重训模型的前提下改进现有VLM的生成结果。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

### [5] [Epistemic-aware Vision-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12953)
*Xiao He,Huangxuan Zhao,Guojia Wan,Wei Zhou,Yanxing Liu,Juhua Liu,Yongchao Xu,Yong Luo,Dacheng Tao,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出面向胎儿超声的FetalMind，核心为将专家二分图与强化学习结合的SED方法，并构建FetalSigma-1M数据集，显著提升诊断与报告生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉-语言模型多针对成人结构化影像，难以处理胎儿超声的多视角推理、病种多样性与图像多样性，且缺乏大规模领域数据和与临床流程一致的推理机制。

Method: 模型设计包括：1) 注入专家-curated的二分图（视图-疾病）用于显著认知解耦，减轻多视角与疾病之间的耦合；2) 使用强化学习优化偏好选择，使推理步骤符合临床流程；3) 在大规模胎儿超声报告集FetalSigma-1M上进行训练。

Result: 在多个基准上，FetalMind较开源与闭源基线平均提升约14%，在关键病症诊断准确率提升61.2%，并表现出高效、稳定与可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了针对胎儿超声的专用医学视觉-语言系统FetalMind，通过显著认知解耦（SED）方法将专家构建的二分图注入模型，以解耦视图与疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导临床可信的推理步骤；同时构建了大规模语料FetalSigma-1M。实验显示在各孕周均超越基线，尤其在关键病症上有显著提升。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [6] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5: a sampler-level guidance stack (ZeResFDG + QSilk) that enhances SD/SDXL outputs—adds frequency-aware guidance, energy rescaling, zero-projection, and a quantile-based micro-detail stabilizer—to get sharper, more faithful, and stable high-resolution images without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve image sharpness, prompt adherence, and artifact control for SD/SDXL latent diffusion without retraining by manipulating guidance in frequency and energy domains and stabilizing high-frequency micro-textures.

Method: Sampler-level guidance stack (ZeResFDG + QSilk)

Result: ZeResFDG (frequency-decoupled reweighting + energy rescaling + zero-projection) combined with spectral EMA hysteresis improves detail and reduces artifacts across samplers; QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer adds robust micro-texture and stability at high resolutions with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: The proposed sampler-level techniques yield consistent improvements in sharpness, prompt adherence, artifact control, and micro-texture robustness for SD/SDXL latent diffusion sampling at modest compute cost and are compatible with different parameterizations.

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

### [7] [Scope: Selective Cross-modal Orchestration of Visual Perception Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12974)
*Tianyu Zhang,Suyuchen Wang,Chao Wang,Juan Rodriguez,Ahmed Masry,Xiangru Jian,Yoshua Bengio,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SCOPE，一种Mixture-of-Encoders框架，通过实例级路由在共享编码器和多个候选编码器中为每个图文对动态选择一个专用编码器，从而在显著降低推理成本的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视觉编码器能提升VLM表现，但简单堆叠会导致收益递减且推理成本成倍增加；需要一种能在保持高性能的同时降低计算成本的方法。

Method: SCOPE维护一个共享编码器和一组可路由编码器；一个轻量级路由器通过文本提示与共享视觉特征的交叉注意力为每个样本选择最优编码器。训练时引入双熵正则化和辅助损失，以在数据集层面负载均衡和实例层面路由置信度间取得平衡。

Result: 在实验中，SCOPE仅用1个共享加1个路由编码器就优于同时使用全部四个额外编码器的模型，并将计算量减少24-49%。

Conclusion: 智能的实例级编码器选择（SCOPE）能优于对所有编码器进行简单聚合，既提升了模型性能又减少了计算开销，挑战了多编码器VLM中“越多越好”的常见做法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

### [8] [SVAG-Bench: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Multi-Instance Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13016)
*Tanveer Hannan,Shuaicong Wu,Mark Weber,Suprosanna Shit,Jindong Gu,Rajat Koner,Aljoša Ošep,Laura Leal-Taixé,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SVAG任务与SVAG-Bench并给出基线SVAGFormer与评估工具，现有模型在此任务上仍有很大进展空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只侧重粗粒度动作识别或一般物体跟踪，缺乏能根据自然语言同时检测、跟踪并时序定位多对象动作的能力，这对智能体与人机交互等系统至关重要。

Method: 构建数据集并定义任务；将视觉语言模型改造为能做时空动作定位与跟踪的SVAGFormer；设计SVAGEval评估工具，提供可复现基准。

Result: 发布SVAG-Bench（688视频、19,590条标注、903动词），基线模型在任务上表现较差，尤其在稠密/复杂场景，表明任务具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了新任务SVAG，构建了大规模基准SVAG-Bench，提出基线模型SVAGFormer和评估工具SVAGEval，指出现有模型在复杂场景下表现不佳，强调需要更强的细粒度时空动作推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

*Zhengxu Tang,Zizheng Wang,Luning Wang,Zitao Shuai,Chenhao Zhang,Siyu Qian,Yirui Wu,Bohao Wang,Haosong Rao,Zhenyu Yang,Chenwei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqBench提出了用于衡量T2V叙事连贯性的基准与DTG自动评估方法，系统揭示当前模型在序列推理与时间连贯性上的不足，并提供数据与指标促进改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前T2V评测侧重视觉质量，缺乏对跨多步事件的逻辑叙事连贯性评估；为此需要一个专门的基准与自动化指标来衡量模型在时间与事件顺序上推理的能力。

Method: 构建包含320条提示的多难度数据集，并从8个先进T2V模型生成2560段视频，所有视频由人工注释叙事连贯性；同时提出基于动态时序图（DTG）的自动评价指标以捕捉长程依赖与时间顺序，并验证其与人工评分的高相关性。

Result: 通过SeqBench评估发现：模型常在多动作序列中无法保持对象状态一致性、在多对象场景中产生物理不合理现象，以及难以维持动作的真实时序与先后关系；DTG指标与人工评分表现出强相关。

Conclusion: SeqBench是首个专门评估文本到视频生成中序列叙事连贯性的基准，揭示了现有T2V模型在多事件序列中的关键短板，并为未来改进提供了可量化指标与数据支持。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过把运动插值作为代理任务并分两步适配，SceneAdapt 在无需联合数据的情况下把场景几何信息注入文本驱动的动作生成模型，提升了场景约束下的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建同时具备丰富文本-动作和精确场景交互的大规模数据集非常困难，因此需要一种方法利用不相交的场景-动作与文本-动作数据集，把场景信息注入到文本到动作的模型中。

Method: 采用运动插值（inbetweening）作为桥接任务：第一阶段引入keyframing层来调制运动潜在表示以进行插值同时保持潜在流形；第二阶段在网络中增加场景条件层，通过跨注意力自适应查询局部场景几何信息，从而注入场景感知。

Result: 实验证明 SceneAdapt 能有效将场景感知注入文本到动作模型，并分析了该能力出现的机制。作者将发布代码和模型。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt 成功将场景感知注入到文本驱动的动作生成模型，通过两阶段适配（inbetweening 与 scene-aware inbetweening）在不需要同时存在文本-动作和场景-动作配对数据的情况下实现场景约束的生成。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出1D卷积+双向Mamba的混合模型，在PhysioNet 2020/2021上显著提升ECG分类性能，适合长序列高效建模与资源受限场景应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的残差网络和Transformer在处理长序列ECG信号时性能受限，状态空间模型为高效长序列建模提供替代方案；因此将卷积与选择性状态空间模型结合以提高ECG分类可靠性与资源受限场景的适应性。

Method: 构建One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network Electrocardiogram Mamba（1D-CNN-ECG Mamba），先用1D卷积提取局部特征，再通过Vision Mamba（一种双向Mamba变体）对时间依赖建模；训练并评估于PhysioNet 2020/2021挑战赛数据集，使用AUPRC与AUROC作为主要指标。

Result: 在12导联ECG上，所提模型在AUPRC与AUROC指标上显著优于先前公开最佳算法，证明Mamba架构在ECG分类任务中的有效性，并具有促进远程医疗与个性化诊疗的潜力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种将一维卷积特征提取与选择性状态空间模型Mamba相结合的混合框架，用于提升ECG异常检测的性能，实验证明在PhysioNet 2020与2021数据集上优于既有方法。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [12] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出XFactor——首个几何自由的自监督NVS模型，核心是通过成对姿态估计与输入/输出增强实现姿态与场景内容解耦，从而获得可迁移的潜在姿态，实验证明效果优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督NVS方法学习到的隐式姿态缺乏迁移性，同一组潜在姿态在不同场景产生不同的相机轨迹，不能实现真正的NVS；因此需要一个无需几何先验且能学习可迁移姿态的模型。

Method: 利用pair-wise pose estimation（成对姿态估计）与一种简单的输入/输出增强策略联合训练，使模型在不借助SE(3)等显式几何表示的情况下，将场景内容与相机姿态解耦，从而学习到可迁移的潜在姿态变量。

Result: XFactor提出了一个无几何先验的自监督新视图合成方法，核心在于姿态可迁移性（transferability）——不同视频序列提取的姿态向量能否在别的场景中复用以重建相同相机轨迹。作者指出以往方法的隐式姿态不可迁移，导致无法实现真正的新视图合成。XFactor结合了成对姿态估计与一种输入输出增强策略，促使模型将相机姿态与场景内容解耦，从而不依赖SE(3)等多视角几何参数化也能学到可迁移的潜在姿态。论文引入了衡量迁移性的度量，并在大规模实验中展示了XFactor显著优于之前的无姿态显式参数化的NVS transformer，同时探究性实验表明隐空间姿态与真实世界姿态高度相关。

Conclusion: XFactor能在无几何先验下学习到可迁移的潜在姿态，实现真正的新视图合成；其隐空间与真实相机姿态高度相关，且在迁移性指标上显著优于此前的pose-free NVS模型。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce a direction-aware multi-scale gradient loss supervising horizontal/vertical signed gradients across scales, leading to sharper, better-aligned edges and richer textures in infrared-visible fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing gradient-magnitude losses collapse directional information, causing ambiguous supervision and poor edge fidelity in fused images.

Method: Direction-aware multi-scale gradient loss for infrared-visible image fusion

Result: Axis-wise, sign-preserving multi-scale gradient loss improves edge sharpness, alignment, and texture preservation without changing architectures or training protocols; validated on open-source models and public benchmarks.

Conclusion: The proposed loss provides clear directional guidance across scales, improving fusion quality and can be integrated into existing pipelines without architecture changes.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 该框架在处理解剖内容差异的跨域分割任务中有效，未来可扩展到其它结构和多模态影像。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

TL;DR: 作者提出CountHalluSet并系统研究扩散模型的计数幻觉，发现采样条件影响显著且FID难以捕捉此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散生成模型经常产生与真实世界知识冲突的“幻觉”样本，缺乏可行的系统性量化方法妨碍了该问题的研究与改进，因而需要针对具体幻觉类型（如计数错误）建立评估基准与分析方法。

Method: 定义计数幻觉概念后构建了包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的CountHalluSet数据集，设计统一的计数评估协议；在不同扩散模型采样条件（求解器类型、ODE阶数、采样步数、初始噪声等）下系统评估生成样本的计数正确性，并与FID等指标进行相关性分析。

Result: 构建了CountHalluSet并给出标准化评估协议，实验证明采样器配置显著影响计数幻觉，FID与计数幻觉相关性弱，提示需要专门指标衡量此类幻觉。

Conclusion: 本文首次系统化量化了扩散模型中的计数幻觉问题，提出CountHalluSet数据集与统一评估协议，并发现常用指标如FID无法可靠反映此类幻觉；研究还揭示采样器、步数、初始噪声等因素会显著影响计数幻觉水平。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种名为 Edit-Your-Interest 的轻量级零样本文本驱动视频编辑方法，核心为缓存关键图像特征的时空特征记忆库(SFM)与相似特征传播(FMP)，并结合注意力图自动生成目标掩码，实现高效且保持时序一致性的精细编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的视频编辑方法计算量大、内存消耗高且常牺牲视觉保真性，导致模糊、马赛克等时序伪影；因此需要一种高效且保持高视觉质量的零样本编辑方案。

Method: 1) 设计 Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory (SFM) 存储空间注意力处理的关键图像tokens；2) 引入 Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP)，从前一帧选取最相关tokens传播到后续帧以保持时序一致性；3) 提出 SFM 更新算法以长期维护缓存特征；4) 利用交叉注意力图自动提取目标掩码并在扩散去噪过程中整合以实现精细对象编辑。

Result: This paper proposes Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight zero-shot text-driven video editing method that uses a spatio-temporal feature memory (SFM) bank to cache important spatial attention tokens, Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) to propagate relevant tokens for temporal consistency, and an SFM update algorithm; it also uses cross-attention maps to auto-extract masks for targeted edits, claiming improved efficiency and visual fidelity.

Conclusion: Edit-Your-Interest 在降低计算与内存消耗的同时，能保持或提升编辑后视频的视觉质量和时序一致性；实验显示其在效率和视觉保真度上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

Motivation: Identify social intervention moments in egocentric AR/VR contexts where AI should or should not speak, to avoid disrupting natural conversations and improve user focus.

Method: 提出EgoSoD：端到端模型将多模态上下文（音频、视觉）整合入社会思维图，动态表示参与者和交互，进行主动的介入时机检测与社交互动识别。

Result: EgoSocial dataset (13,500 video-question pairs) benchmark and EgoSoD method that models multimodal cues into a social thinking graph; improves intervention timing and social interaction detection (e.g., +45.6% Phi-4 on Intervention Timing).

Conclusion: EgoSoD结合音频/视觉等多模态线索，动态建模参与者与互动关系，显著优于现有OMLMs，在介入时机与社交互动感知上取得大幅提升；数据集与代码即将发布。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive

address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key

scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在图像空间操作生成逆变换，导致逆映射精度不足且可能出现折叠；本工作旨在改进逆变换的准确性与变换质量，满足计算解剖学和形态计量学需求。

Method: 核心为Variational Principle(VP)网格生成：通过预定Jacobian和curl构造非折叠网格，生成的空间变换属于微分同胚群，并在该群内生成逆变换。

Result: VPreg是一种基于变分原理的微分同胚配准方法，通过在同胚群内生成逆变换并强制正Jacobian行列式来保证变换的可逆性与无折叠性。实验在OASIS-1数据集上对150次脑部配准进行了评估，并在35个感兴趣区域上用Dice评分与ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg、FSL-Fnirt比较，结果显示在配准准确性、变换正则性以及逆变换精度和一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VPreg在保证变换无折叠性与逆映射准确性的同时，提供了更高的配准Dice分数和更好的正则性，是脑影像配准的有力替代。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

TL;DR: Use LLM prompts to enrich text polysemy and a hypergraph adapter to create multilateral text-image connections, boosting cross-modal retrieval significantly


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Texts and images have different information entropy, causing imbalance in cross-modal retrieval; use LLM's open semantic knowledge to fill entropy gap and reproduce human-like alignment

Method: Entropy-enhancing alignment via LLM + hypergraph adapter

Result: OS-HGAdapter improves text-to-image by 16.8% and image-to-text by 40.1% on Flickr30K and MS-COCO, achieving SOTA in semantic alignment

Conclusion: Combining LLM-based entropy enhancement with a hypergraph adapter effectively balances cross-modal entropy and corrects semantic matching errors, leading to large retrieval gains

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical

Conclusion: 利用跨区域不变的物理特性作为先验并在测试时通过自监督损失动态微调，可有效提升预训练模型在新环境下的去噪性能，为实际地球物理测量提供更可靠的信号处理方案。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Motivation: Reduce communication while maximizing GS quality by selecting valuable client views

Method: Edge Gaussian splatting optimization

Result: STT-GS sampling + FDC + PTTM + JCSPC solved via PAMM achieves superior performance; accurate prediction with low sampling ratios (~10%)

Conclusion: GS导向目标能被低采样率准确预测，提出方法在真实数据集上显著优于基线，达成视图贡献与通信成本间的良好折中。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and
will be released https://github.com/VitaLemonTea1/CIGOcc

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Paper Copilot builds an archive and dataset of peer reviews across CS venues and analyzes ICLR reviews over time to enable reproducible, large-scale study of peer-review evolution and to inform evidence-based improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper addresses strains on the peer-review system caused by rapid AI conference growth, causing workload, expertise mismatch, inconsistent standards, superficial reviews, and limited accountability.

Method: Collect reviews across venues into durable digital archives, release open dataset, and perform large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR reviews across years.

Result: They introduce Paper Copilot: a system to create durable digital archives of peer reviews across CS venues, an open dataset for large-scale study, and a large empirical analysis of ICLR reviews over multiple years. They release infrastructure and dataset to support reproducible research.

Conclusion: Releasing infrastructure and dataset will help track review-process changes, diagnose failure modes, and support improvements toward a more transparent and reliable peer-review system.

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

TL;DR: MimicParts通过部位感知风格编码和注意力，使语音驱动的3D人体动作在区域细节和对节奏/情绪响应方面更自然、更具表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成具有风格化的3D人体动作从语音信号中存在挑战：语音、个体风格和身体动作之间关系复杂且细粒度。现有方法在风格编码上要么过于简化，要么忽略身体不同区域的风格差异，并且未考虑随语音节奏和情绪变化动态调整风格。

Method: 将身体划分为若干区域，使用局部风格编码器和部位感知去噪网络，结合部位感知注意力块将语音的节奏与情绪信息注入对应部位，产生动态适配的风格化动作。

Result: 提出MimicParts框架，通过部位感知的风格注入和去噪网络，将身体划分为不同区域以编码局部运动风格，并通过部位感知注意力模块使节奏和情绪线索精确影响各部位。

Conclusion: MimicParts在实验中优于现有方法，生成更自然和富有表现力的3D人体动作序列。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

TL;DR: This survey unifies Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) into Prompt-based Adaptation (PA), provides taxonomy and analysis across methods, granularity, domains, and discusses benchmarks and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: clarify distinctions and unify VP and VPT under Prompt-based Adaptation (PA)

Method: survey + taxonomy

Result: taxonomy covering learnable/generative/non-learnable prompts and pixel/token-level injection; applications across domains; benchmarks and challenges

Conclusion: PA offers a lightweight, adaptable framework for vision model adaptation; more systematic evaluation, benchmarking, and exploration across modalities are needed.

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个样本中心的多任务学习框架，联合学习样本级缺陷分类与像素级分割以提升稀疏、小尺度、低对比度缺陷的检测和定位稳定性，并引入决策关联指标Seg_mIoU和Seg_Recall来更公平评估定位质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业生产中，前景-背景极度不平衡、缺陷稀疏及尺度长尾分布、低对比度导致像素级训练受大面积背景主导，模型难以关注小或低对比缺陷，样本级决策稳定性不足。

Method: 基于共享编码器的多任务网络，同时输出样本级分类与像素级分割。样本级监督调整特征分布并在梯度层面提高对小/低对比缺陷的召回；分割分支保持边界和形状信息。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上，方法在样本级决策可靠性和缺陷定位完整性上有显著提升，指标上改进了召回和定位相关的度量。

Conclusion: 样本级监督与分割分支联合训练能显著提升样本级决策的可靠性和缺陷定位的完整性，特别对稀疏或低对比度缺陷效果明显。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

*Inha Kang,Youngsun Lim,Seonho Lee,Jiho Choi,Junsuk Choe,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoVAND数据集和NegToMe模块，通过在输入层合并否定词与相关词汇并结合LoRA微调，显著提升VLMs对否定的理解，NMS-AP提升达+10.8并降低误报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在处理否定时存在affirmative bias，特别在DOD任务中常将含否定描述的对象误判为存在，影响实际检测性能，因而需要从数据与模型结构层面改进否定理解能力。

Method: 方法包括(1) 采用链式思维(CoT)与视觉问答(VQA)的流水线生成实例级否定数据集CoVAND；(2) 设计NegToMe模块，在输入层将否定词与属性/名词合并为单一token以保留极性信息，并结合参数高效的LoRA微调策略。

Result: 在多个否定挑战基准上取得显著改进，NMS-AP在OVDEval上最高提升+10.8点，同时降低了假正率，且方法可推广到现有SoTA VLMs。

Conclusion: 该工作通过构建高质量否定数据集CoVAND和提出轻量级的NegToMe文本合并模块，有效缓解了VLMs在否定理解上的affirmative bias，尤其在描述性目标检测（DOD）任务上显著降低误报并提升NMS-AP表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

TL;DR: UniVector通过实例-几何交互和结构化查询，在单模型中高效提取多种矢量类型，实验证明其优于现有方法，且发布了新的多结构数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量提取方法将实例属性与几何属性独立处理，导致模型针对特定结构设计，限制了对复杂多结构场景的处理能力；受人脑同时处理语义与空间信息的启发，提出利用实例-几何交互实现统一提取。

Method: 将矢量表示为包含实例级和几何级信息的结构化查询，利用交互模块进行跨层次上下文交换，并通过动态形状约束优化全局结构与关键点，迭代更新查询以生成最终矢量。

Result: 在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上均获得SOTA结果，并引入Multi-Vector数据集用于多结构评测。

Conclusion: 本文提出UniVector，一种统一的矢量提取框架，通过实例-几何交互在单一模型中提取多种矢量结构，克服了现有方法对单一结构的依赖。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

TL;DR: EPIPTrack用显式（把运动转成文本）与隐式（伪词+可学习描述子）提示动态建模目标语义，通过CLIP调整并配合特征增强器，使跟踪在MOT17/MOT20/DanceTrack上更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的跟踪依赖静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的自适应性且易出现幻觉，需设计动态且个性化的语义提示机制以提升跟踪性能。

Method: 1) 显式提示：将空间运动信息转换为自然语言描述，作为时空引导；2) 隐式提示：用伪词与可学习描述子构建个性化语义表征；3) 通过CLIP文本编码器动态调整提示；4) 设计判别性特征增强器提升视觉与跨模态特征；5) 在MOT17/MOT20/DanceTrack上进行评测。

Result: EPIPTrack提出了一种结合显式与隐式提示的统一多模态视觉-语言跟踪框架，通过将运动信息转化为自然语言以及引入伪词和可学习描述子来构建目标的个性化语义表示，并利用CLIP文本编码器对提示进行动态调整，同时配合判别性特征增强器提高视觉与跨模态表征质量。

Conclusion: 方法能动态响应目标状态变化，减少静态文本带来的幻觉问题，且在多数据集上验证出较好的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出EDPA，一种可直接放置在相机视野内、模型无关的对抗补丁攻击，通过破坏视觉-文本潜空间对齐和放大对抗/干净表示差异来使VLA模型失败；并通过对抗微调视觉编码器作为有效防御，在LIBERO上验证了攻击与防御效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在实现复杂机器人任务方面取得了重大进展，但其对抗鲁棒性未被充分研究；需要探索现实可部署的对抗攻击（如可放置补丁）并设计对应防御来保证机器人执行的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 提出了模型无关的Embedding Disruption Patch Attack（EDPA），通过优化两个目标：破坏视觉与文本语义对齐，及最大化对抗与干净图像在潜空间表征的差异；生成可直接放置于相机视野内的物理补丁。防御采用对视觉编码器进行对抗微调，使其对干净与对抗扰动输入生成相似潜在表示。

Result: 在LIBERO仿真基准上，EDPA显著提高了先进VLA模型的任务失败率，而对视觉编码器的对抗微调能有效缓解这一失败率上升。代码已开源。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了针对视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型的对抗补丁攻击（EDPA）与对应防御方法，证明了VLA模型在现实可放置补丁下存在脆弱性，并通过对视觉编码器的对抗微调实现了有效加固。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

Conclusion: FlyAwareV2 fills dataset gap for UAV urban 3D scene understanding, enabling training and evaluation of multimodal models and domain adaptation approaches; useful resource for future research

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法在嵌入式设备上实现了超实时的拥挤计数，推理速度领先且精度具有竞争力，适合需要实时性的应用场景。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

### [38] [End-to-End Multi-Modal Diffusion Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13253)
*Chunhao Lu,Qiang Lu,Meichen Dong,Jake Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDM is a unified VAE + Mamba-based selection diffusion model that progressively generates modality-specific outputs, enabling better joint multi-modal representation and strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unify multi-modal processing and enable joint representation learning across modalities using a single encoder-decoder VAE with selection diffusion.

Method: Call to analyze described paper

Result: MDM shows superior performance on high-dimensional outputs like high-res images and long text, outperforming several end-to-end models and competitive with SOTA multimodal LLMs.

Conclusion: MDM effectively unifies encoding and decoding for multi-modal tasks, improving performance and efficiency, suggesting new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

TL;DR: Introduces MMLongCite, an 8-task, 6-length-interval multimodal benchmark (text/images/videos) showing LVLMs struggle to use long contexts faithfully, with insights on length and position impacts


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address lack of multimodal long-context faithfulness evaluation for LVLMs by creating benchmark MMLongCite

Method: Paper analysis

Result: SOTA LVLMs show limited faithfulness on long multimodal contexts; analysis of context length and critical content position effects

Conclusion: MMLongCite reveals gaps in LVLMs' long-context multimodal fidelity and highlights need for improved architectures/training to better utilize extended context windows

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaskDCPT：用退化类型分类作为弱监督，结合掩码图像重建进行预训练，显著提升CNN/Transformer在通用图像恢复任务上的性能，并发布2.5M的多退化数据集UIR-2.5M。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是通过弱监督的退化类型信息与图像重建任务结合，学习通用且鲁棒的恢复表征，以解决多种退化类型和不同强度的图像恢复问题。

Method: 方法包括一个编码器和两个解码器：编码器对掩码低质量图像提取特征；分类解码器预测退化类型；重建解码器重构高质量图像。结合掩码图像建模与对比学习进行联合训练。

Result: MaskDCPT提出了一种新的用于图像恢复预训练的方法，通过对退化类型的弱监督与重建任务联合学习，提升模型在多种退化上的泛化能力和恢复效果。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT在五维全能恢复任务上至少提升3.77 dB的PSNR，并在真实退化场景下将PIQE降低34.8%，对未见退化类型亦表现出强泛化能力，预训练的编码器可作为通用恢复特征提取器。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at

Motivation: 目标是构建一个能在非理想拍摄条件下（光照变化、任意朝向、弯曲/部分遮挡、低分辨率、远距离文本）稳定工作的自动文档分类系统，适用于离线与实时采集。

Method: 四阶段管道：图像采集与预处理；使用DBNet++（Differentiable Binarization Network Plus）进行文本检测；使用BART对检测到的文本进行分类；用Python+PyQt5实现交互界面并支持摄像头实时输入；在Total-Text数据集（高分辨率、挑战性场景）上评估文本检测性能。

Conclusion: 该系统在处理现实场景中多种拍摄条件下的文档分类任务上表现良好，文本检测达到约92.88%，整体方法适用于离线与实时图像源的文档自动分类。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于统计相关性的表示学习在3D新类发现中易受混杂因素影响，导致对新类的混淆。引入因果关系约束能更准确捕获与类别相关的本质点云表示，改善新类推断。

Method: 基于结构因果模型(SCM)，分析基类表示中的隐藏混杂因素，学习因果表示原型以去除混杂性；构建基类因果表示原型与新类原型之间的图结构，进行因果推理以推断新类语义；在训练中联合学习因果表示和推理模块。

Conclusion: 本文提出在点云新类发现任务中引入结构因果模型，通过因果表示原型消除混杂因素并用图结构对基类到新类进行因果推理，从而提升新类分割性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个GPU并行化的全局SfM系统，通过稀疏感知的BA技术加速BA与GP，在大规模（如数千张）重建任务中实现高达约40倍的速度提升且保持或提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CPU实现的COLMAP/GLOMAP在大规模场景中计算开销巨大，导致精度与速度的权衡；而现有基于学习的方法（如VGGSfM、VGGT）受限于GPU内存，无法处理成千上万张图像。为此，作者希望充分利用GPU并行能力，构建既高效又灵活的大规模SfM系统。

Method: 设计并实现了面向GPU的SfM流水线，各关键阶段（包括特征匹配、BA和GP）均利用GPU并行化。基于最新稀疏感知的BA优化方法，扩展以支持GP并在统一框架内协同运行，从而提升大规模场景下的可扩展性与效率。

Result: 在多个规模不同的数据集上进行大量实验（例如5000张图像，VGGSfM和VGGT无法运行），方法在速度上相比COLMAP最高约40倍加速，同时在重建精度上保持可比或更优结果。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个基于GPU并行计算的统一全局SfM框架，通过稀疏感知的BA优化技术加速BA和全局定位（GP），在保持或提升重建精度的同时大幅降低计算时间。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

### [44] [Self-Augmented Visual Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13315)
*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种查询相关的自我增强提示与基于输出稀疏性的自适应阈值解码方法，在无需训练下显著减少LVLMs的幻觉并提升事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉对比解码使用的视觉增强通常与文本查询无关，导致增强可能引入与查询不相关的视觉噪声，从而限制了纠错能力；同时常用解码只考虑部分候选而忽视logit整体信息，未自适应处理输出熵，影响决策质量。

Method: 方法包括两部分：1）自我增强提示（self-augmentation prompting），利用模型本身知识根据文本查询动态生成与视觉增强一致的提示，从而使视觉增强语义与查询对齐；2）自适应阈值算法（adaptive thresholding），根据输出概率分布的稀疏性动态调整下一个候选词的大小，充分利用logit分布信息。该方法无需训练，作为解码阶段的策略可直接应用在多个LVLM上。

Result: 在四个LVLM和七个基准上的大量实验表明，该无训练解码策略在事实一致性指标上明显优于现有最先进的解码方法，证明了查询相关增强与熵感知解码的重要性。

Conclusion: 该文提出一种训练-free的解码策略，通过自我增强提示和自适应阈值机制，显著降低LVLMs的幻觉现象，提升了生成的事实一致性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

Motivation: 理解并量化视觉有趣性以预测并影响人类注意力与消费行为，评估大型多模态模型在该任务上的表现与可用性。

Method: 用GPT-4o对图像对进行有趣性排序，与人类评估和现有方法比较；将GPT-4o生成的标签作为训练数据蒸馏到学习排序模型中。

Result: GPT-4o partially aligns with human judgments on visual interestingness and outperforms state-of-the-art methods; it can label image pairs for training data; distilled into learning-to-rank model for predicting interestingness.

Conclusion: GPT-4o已能较好捕捉视觉有趣性概念，可用于自动标注图像对并训练排序模型，从而推进对人类注意力兴趣的理解。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种训练策略，使得在训练过程中可逐步移除光流估计器中的代价体(cost volume)，从而在推理时显著降低内存占用并提高速度，同时在精度上仍能与最先进方法匹敌。论文展示了三种不同计算预算下的模型：包含最准确模型（1.2×更快、6×更低内存）和最快模型（可在500MB显存下以20FPS处理1080p）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代价体计算和内存开销高，限制了光流估计器的速度与分辨率；观察到当网络其它部分充分训练后，代价体的重要性下降，因此希望通过训练策略减少推理时对代价体的依赖。

Method: 提出一种训练策略：在训练早期使用标准的代价体结构辅助网络学习光流，然后逐步或最终移除代价体并训练剩余网络（如RA F T风格的迭代更新模块）使其独立预测光流。基于该策略训练出三种不同规模的模型以适配不同计算资源。

Result: 训练得到的模型在精度上达到或超越现有最先进水平，同时推理速度加快（最优模型1.2×更快）且内存占用显著降低（最多6×），最快模型可在500MB显存下以20FPS处理Full HD。

Conclusion: 通过在训练阶段保留代价体以辅助学习，但在推理时移除代价体，模型能保持高精度同时显著提升推理速度和降低内存使用，达到了与现有最先进方法相当或更优的结果。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

Motivation: 现有VQ-VAE方法要么使用隐式静态码本，要么对整个码本进行联合优化，导致学习能力受限或码本塌缩，影响重建质量；因此提出按组优化以改善码本利用和重建性能。

Method: 将整体码本划分为多个组，对每组独立优化；组内元素采用联合优化策略；引入训练后无训练的码本重采样算法以调整码本大小。

Result: Group-VQ提出了一种对码本进行按组优化的方法，每组内进行联合优化，组间独立优化，并提出了训练后可重采样的码本调整方法。实验在图像重构任务上展示了更好的重建性能和码本灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ在保持高重建质量的同时提升了码本利用率与灵活性；训练后重采样方法允许根据需要调整码本规模而无需重新训练。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

TL;DR: 作者为渲染视频提出了专门的数据集与无参考质量评估指标，综合图像质量与时间稳定性，显著优于现有方法并可用于超采样与实时渲染评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对渲染视频的质量评估在实际应用（如游戏、VR/AR）中非常重要，但现有NR-VQA数据集与指标主要针对相机采集视频，无法很好适用于渲染视频，因渲染视频更易出现时序伪影。作者希望构建一个专门面向渲染视频的数据集并设计相应的无参考质量评估指标。

Method: 收集多场景、多渲染设置与多显示类型的视频并进行主观打分；设计一个结合单帧图像质量评估和时间稳定性分析的无参考指标，对模型进行校准与验证，并与现有NR-VQA方法比较性能，最后应用于超采样与实时帧生成评价。

Result: 构建了一个大规模渲染导向的视频数据集，包含多种3D场景、渲染设置与不同显示类型的主观质量标注；并提出一个结合图像质量与时序稳定性评估的NR-VQA指标。该指标在渲染视频上优于现有NR-VQA方法，可用于基准测试超采样方法与实时渲染的帧生成策略评估。

Conclusion: 针对渲染视频建立的专属数据集与校准后的NR-VQA指标能更准确评估渲染视频质量，尤其在检测和量化时序伪影方面表现更好，可用于实际渲染算法与显示策略的评估与优化。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

Motivation: 探索提示设计如何影响零样本视觉语言模型区分视觉相似的人体姿态，尤其在数据稀缺条件下提高泛化与稳健性。

Method: 构建285张COCO衍生图像数据集，比较OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2、SigLip三种VLM；设计三层提示（基础、中等、详细）并测量多类准确率与混淆，分析提示细化对可视相似类别（坐、站、走/跑）识别的影响。

Result: 对MetaCLIP 2与OpenCLIP，最简单提示多类准确率最高（例如MetaCLIP 2从68.8%降至55.1%）；详细提示导致性能显著下降（称为“prompt overfitting”）；相反，SigLip在使用包含身体线索的描述性提示时改善了对模糊类别的识别。

Conclusion: 简单提示在高性能VLM上优于复杂描述，表明提示过拟合问题；低性能模型在加入身体细节提示时有所改善。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

*Tianyuan Yuan,Yicheng Liu,Chenhao Lu,Zhuoguang Chen,Tao Jiang,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthVLA adds depth predictions into a VLA mixture-of-transformers, boosting spatial reasoning and achieving strong gains across real and simulated tasks


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models lack precise spatial reasoning; action-data pretraining insufficient and inefficient

Method: Mixture-of-transformers with depth module

Result: DepthVLA improves spatial reasoning by integrating pretrained depth prediction into a unified transformer design with shared attentions

Conclusion: Explicit depth integration offers efficient and effective spatial grounding for VLA models, outperforming prior methods on several benchmarks

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

Motivation: 减少对相机+LiDAR、真实3D分割与运动标注（tracklets或SMPL模板）这些昂贵/困难数据的依赖，同时保持或提升动态城市场景重建与渲染性能。

Method: 使用2D无物体先验（深度估计与点跟踪）构建初始约束，结合SDF表征动态物体形状，并在3DGS中加入SDF正则化，通过联合优化提高几何准确性与形变建模

Result: 提出了一种将有向距离函数(SDF)与3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS)结合的统一优化方法，用于城市动态场景的重建与渲染

Conclusion: 融合SDF与3DGS能提高几何精度与形变建模能力，在缺少LiDAR或3D运动注释时仍能取得竞争性渲染性能，并支持场景分解与合成等编辑任务

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

TL;DR: 引入大模型语义先验的WiFi手势识别框架（GLSDA）：双路径CSI编码＋多尺度语义编码＋语义感知软监督＋双向蒸馏，提升跨域泛化并压缩模型，Wid ar3.0上优于SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CSI方法受域偏移与语义表达能力限制，缺乏高层抽象；利用大模型的语义先验可增强表示并改善跨域泛化及可部署性。

Method: 1) 双路径CSI编码（CSI-Ratio相位序列与Doppler频谱）提取几何和动态特征；2）多尺度语义编码器与跨模态注意力对齐手势语义；3）语义感知软监督编码类间相关、降低标签歧义；4）稳健双向蒸馏把教师知识压缩到学生网络。

Result: Paper proposes GLSDA framework using semantic priors from large pre-trained models to improve WiFi-based gesture recognition; includes dual-path CSI encoding, multiscale semantic encoder with cross-modal attention, semantic-aware soft supervision, and robust dual-distillation to produce lightweight student model; shows SOTA results on Widar3.0 and reduces model size/latency.

Conclusion: GLSDA利用大模型语义提高了WiFi手势表示的语义性与泛化能力，同时通过蒸馏生成轻量模型，适合AIoT部署。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE填补了现有基准在内在-动态空间推理评估上的空白，展示当前VLM在这类任务上明显不足，并为未来研究提供数据集、评测框架和方法路线。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

Motivation: 现有RL在T2I主要集中于扩散或自回归模型，忽视了掩码生成模型这一重要范式，作者希望填补这一空白并提升掩码模型的生成质量与偏好对齐。

Method: 提出将掩码解码过程建模为多步马尔可夫决策过程，重新定义转移概率以适配掩码模型；在GRPO框架下去除KL约束、采用reduction策略并过滤低质量样本以稳定训练与提升效果。

Result: 在基线Show-o上通过Mask-GRPO在标准T2I基准和偏好对齐评测上均实现显著提升，超过现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO有效地将GRPO风格的强化学习引入掩码生成模型，通过重定义转移概率并将解掩过程视为多步决策，提高了文本到图像生成的质量与偏好一致性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

TL;DR: 提出Patch-Adapter：双阶段（全局一致性适配器+补丁参考适配器）扩散模型适配策略，实现无模型重构的4K+文本引导图像修复，提升了高分辨率下的结构一致性与局部细节保真性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导图像修复方法通常受限于较低分辨率，随着分辨率和纹理复杂度增加，内容一致性和提示对齐成为更大的挑战。Patch-Adapter旨在弥合这一可扩展性差距，提升4K+场景下的修复质量。

Method: 方法包含Dual Context Adapter（在降采样分辨率上学习有无掩码区域的一致性以建立全局结构一致性）和Reference Patch Adapter（在全分辨率上实现基于补丁的注意力机制，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真）。两阶段解耦全局语义与局部精修，通过补丁级注意力和特征融合实现高分辨率细节恢复。

Result: 在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上，Patch-Adapter在感知质量和文本提示遵从性上优于现有方法，有效减少了大尺度修复常见的人为痕迹与失真，达到SOTA表现。

Conclusion: Patch-Adapter提出了一种有效的两阶段适配器架构，能在不改动底层扩散模型结构的情况下，将图像修复分辨率从1K扩展到4K+，并在高分辨率场景下保持内容一致性与提示对齐。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

*Yushan Han,Hui Zhang,Honglei Zhang,Chuntao Ding,Yuanzhouhan Cao,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDS aligns heterogeneous agent features via lightweight conv resizer and domain separation modules with a mutual-information loss, enabling efficient collaborative perception in heterogeneous encoder settings


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address feature discrepancies when collaborating agents use different encoders; reduce vulnerability to domain gap noise and avoid heavy transformer modules to keep inference efficient

Method: Domain separation for heterogeneous collaborative perception

Result: Proposed CoDS with LSCR (lightweight conv-based spatial-channel resizer), DADS (encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation), and DAMI loss to maximize mutual information; fully convolutional architecture achieves better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency

Conclusion: CoDS mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios, improving detection accuracy while maintaining high inference efficiency due to fully convolutional design and lightweight modules

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Method: 引入一个可微渲染流水线，使用径向基函数参数化网格变形，学习偏移和尺度参数以最大化神经元响应，同时加入几何正则化以保持网格平滑性；将合成3D网格渲染为2D输入以测量模型神经元响应并反向传递梯度更新网格参数。

Result: 在猴子V4模型上实验表明，该方法能够产生高效能刺激并解析神经元对3D因素（姿态、照明等）的敏感性，展示了比传统像素基方法更具物理可解释性的选择性探测能力。

Conclusion: 可微渲染结合网格变形可在3D空间直接合成MEI，能揭示神经模型对物理可解释因素的选择性，弥合逆向图形学与系统神经科学，超越仅基于像素的方法。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address real-world FER challenges (pose, occlusion, lighting, demographics) and improve engagement detection by adaptive expert selection and multi-scale feature extraction

Method: Hybrid CNN + MoE with residual backbone

Result: Accuracies: AffectNet v7 74.77%, AffectNet v8 72.55%, RAF-DB 84.29%, FER-2013 64.66%

Conclusion: ExpressNet-MoE通过动态专家选择与多尺度特征融合，提高了FER在多场景下的泛化能力，可用于实际端到端情感识别系统。

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

TL;DR: Use MLLMs to judge query-candidate semantic alignment, generate soft scores for hard negative mining and training, align similarity matrix with soft labels, and train a reranker — leads to improved retrieval performance


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited discriminative ability and lack of diverse/hard negatives in existing multimodal embedding training by leveraging MLLM semantic understanding to mine quality hard negatives and provide soft supervision

Method: Construct hard negatives using MLLM judgments and soft labels

Result: State-of-the-art average performance on MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks using UniME-V2 and UniME-V2-Reranker

Conclusion: MLLM-as-a-Judge plus soft-label alignment and reranker yields more discriminative universal multimodal embeddings and better retrieval results

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

TL;DR: 作者提出在复杂情绪识别中采用增量学习策略：先学习基础情绪，再像人类一样逐步学习复合情绪。论文发现动作单元（Action Units，AUs）作为面部肌肉运动的语义化、稳定特征，比浅/深卷积网络提取的特征更鲁棒，有助于缓解灾难性遗忘。基于AUs的方法在CFEE数据集上对复合情绪的增量学习取得0.75准确率，且模型轻量、内存占用小，可与现有最先进方法比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增量学习中常见的灾难性遗忘问题与瞬态特征有关，复杂情绪识别更接近人类学习过程：先掌握基础情绪，再学习复合情绪；因此需寻找语义化且跨任务稳定的特征来提高增量学习性能。

Method: 先训练基础情绪分类器，再增量学习复合情绪，特征采用面部动作单元（AUs）而非直接用卷积神经网络提取的特征；在CFEE数据集上评估，比较AUs与浅层/深层卷积网络特征的表现，并测量模型精度与内存占用。

Result: 基于AUs的增量学习方法在CFEE上对复合情绪取得准确率0.75，表现优于使用浅/深卷积网络特征的方法，同时模型更加轻量、内存占用更小。

Conclusion: 使用AUs作为非瞬态、高语义性的特征，可有效支持增量学习复杂情绪，取得良好准确率并保持模型轻量化，能减轻旧任务遗忘问题。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

TL;DR: 提出了局部隐式神经3D乳房形状模型(liRBSM)并构建一个仅需单目RGB视频的低成本三维表面重建流程。通过将隐式空间分解为多个局部SDF并基于SfM得到的稀疏-稠密重建，显著优于全局iRBSM，重建误差<2mm，速度快、开源可复现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有商业3D乳房扫描仪昂贵且不可普及，低成本替代方案精度不足；因此提出一种仅用单目RGB视频、无需专用硬件或闭源软件即可获得高精度3D乳房几何的解决方案。

Method: 使用现成的Structure-from-Motion重建相机与稀疏点云；建立一个基于解剖学标志点锚定的多区域局部隐式模型，每个区域用局部神经SDF表示；将局部SDF拼接为整体形状并优化以匹配图像/点云；生成带尺度的、仪器无关的表面重建。

Result: 在公开实现中，liRBSM较iRBSM表现更好，能在<6分钟内完成重建，重建误差小于2 mm，产生更丰富细节的表面，且开源可访问。

Conclusion: liRBSM通过局部化隐式神经SDF并结合SfM管线，实现了在普通RGB视频上快速、精确（<2mm误差）、开源的3D乳房表面重建，优于先前全局隐式模型（iRBSM）。

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究在Jetson Orin与AMD Versal SoC上比较GPU与FPGA加速特征检测器在V-SLAM中的表现。非学习型（FAST/Harris）GPU更优，学习型（SuperPoint）FPGA更优；FPGA V-SLAM有时能匹配或超越GPU V-SLAM速度，但GPU整体精度更好。硬件加速可降低全局BA调用频率，提升吞吐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机等受限能耗平台上对实时V-SLAM需求增加，探索在现代SoC上选择GPU或FPGA来硬件加速特征检测，以在性能、能效与V-SLAM精度间取得最佳权衡。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin与AMD Versal SoC上实现并比较GPU与FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint检测器；将这些实现集成进V-SLAM管道；对运行时间、能效、FPS及V-SLAM准确性在多组数据集序列中进行定量评估；分析全局束调整调用频率与整体系统影响。

Result: This paper empirically compares GPU vs FPGA acceleration for feature detectors within a V-SLAM pipeline on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal). It benchmarks non-learning detectors (FAST, Harris) and a learning-based detector (SuperPoint), measuring runtime performance, energy efficiency, and V-SLAM accuracy across datasets. Key findings: GPUs outperform FPGAs for FAST/Harris in speed and energy; for SuperPoint, FPGA outperforms GPU (up to 3.1x runtime and 1.4x energy); FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can match GPU V-SLAM runtime and has better FPS on some sequences; GPU V-SLAM is generally more accurate; hardware-accelerated feature detection can reduce frequency of global bundle adjustment, improving V-SLAM throughput without losing accuracy.

Conclusion: GPU更适合加速传统特征检测器（FAST/Harris）以获得更好性能与能效；FPGA在加速学习型检测器（SuperPoint）时具有显著优势。总体上，GPU-accelerated V-SLAM通常更精确，而FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM在部分场景可提供竞争性的实时性能与更低能耗。硬件加速特征检测可减少全局束调整调用，提升V-SLAM效率且不牺牲精度。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: Agent-based CLIP-feature streaming benchmark shows cultural composition and blur interact to produce asymmetric FER robustness; balanced mixes help, imbalances hurt under high blur


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing FER evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery; need to understand robustness across cultural variation and progressive blur

Method: Agent-based streaming FER eval with CLIP features and residual adapters

Result: Asymmetric degradation between JAFFE and KDEF; JAFFE higher at low blur but sharp drop at intermediate blur; KDEF degrades uniformly; mixed populations yield intermediate patterns, balanced mixtures mitigate early degradation, imbalanced amplify majority weaknesses under high blur

Conclusion: Cultural composition and interaction structure quantitatively affect FER robustness under perceptual degradation; balanced cultural mixes can mitigate early degradation but majority dominance can worsen high-blur performance

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶场景中，雷达-相机融合能在恶劣条件下提供鲁棒的几何信息，但部署在资源受限设备上要求模型轻量化且保持性能；同时需要提升模型可解释性以便验证与调试。

Method: 设计轻量化网络（XD-RCDepth）；可解释性对齐蒸馏：使学生学习教师的显著性/注意力图以保留重要特征；深度分布蒸馏：将深度回归转为离散区间上的软标签分类并用概率分布蒸馏损失训练学生。

Result: XD-RCDepth提出了一种用于雷达-相机融合深度估计的轻量级网络，在参数量上相比最先进轻量基线减少29.7%，同时保持相近精度。为在模型压缩下保持性能并提升可解释性，作者设计了两种蒸馏策略：1）可解释性对齐蒸馏，将教师模型的显著性结构传递给学生模型；2）深度分布蒸馏，将深度回归重构为离散深度区间上的软分类。结合这两种方法，相较直接训练将MAE降低7.97%，并在nuScenes和ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集上实现了实时效率与竞争性精度。

Conclusion: XD-RCDepth通过结构压缩与两种知识蒸馏有效提升了轻量学生模型的性能与可解释性，在保持实时性的同时达到与更大模型接近的深度估计精度。

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

Motivation: 解决单模态视觉方法在遮挡、低照度、恶劣天气下不可靠的问题，以及缺乏大规模同步音视频数据集阻碍多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: 使用Wav2Vec2提取音频时序特征，MobileViT提取视频局部与全局特征，采用早期融合机制将两模态合并，随后通过多阶段时序卷积网络(MTCN)学习长时依赖并进行异常识别。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net在准确性、效率和泛化能力方面均表现出色，VAAR数据集为多模态异常识别提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

TL;DR: DINOv2的少样本最近邻异常检测对小扰动敏感且置信度未校准，Platt缩放能显著改善不确定性估计并帮助检测对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在DINOv2基础模型上训练自由的少样本异常检测器对抗攻击的脆弱性和不确定性校准问题。

Method: 在冻结DINOv2特征上附加轻量线性头用于生成白盒梯度攻击（如FGSM），在MVTec-AD与VisA数据集上评估性能下降；采用训练后Platt缩放对异常分数进行概率校准并比较ECE与预测熵差异。

Result: 发现使用白盒线性头生成的对抗扰动能显著降低检测性能（F1, AUROC, AP, G-mean），原始异常分数校准较差；经Platt缩放后能提高对抗输入的预测熵并降低ECE，从而提供有效的攻击检测标志。

Conclusion: DINOv2-based少样本异常检测存在可被对抗扰动误导的脆弱性且原始置信度不可靠；通过简单的后验Platt校准可提升不确定性估计与攻击检测能力，但仍需将鲁棒性与不确定性量化作为部署必要能力。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

TL;DR: EditCast3D用视频生成模型把单帧编辑传播到整个视图集，并通过视角选择和前馈重建保证多视图一致性，从而在效率和编辑质量上优于现有3D编辑方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接把大型基础模型逐帧用于多视图会带来高昂计算、API限制和提示不一致问题；因此通过先在视频级别传播编辑并选取重建友好视图，可以兼顾效率与多视图一致性。

Method: 1) 在第一帧上使用基础模型进行目标编辑；2) 用视频生成模型将该编辑传播到整个视图序列，得到一致性较高的视频级编辑结果；3) 通过视角选择模块挑选出对重建最有利的视图子集；4) 使用前馈的重建方法从选定视图直接重建3D模型，无需昂贵的后期精炼。

Result: EditCast3D提出了一种将视频生成基础模型用于3D编辑传播的流水线，通过在重建前将单帧编辑扩散到整个数据集，减少对昂贵图像编辑器的依赖。论文的关键创新包括：1）利用视频模型从第一帧传播编辑以实现数据集级一致性；2）提出视角选择策略，挑选对多视图重建友好的视图以提升一致性和几何保真；3）采用前馈重建流程，避免代价高昂的精炼步骤。实验在常用3D编辑数据集上与SOTA基线对比，展示了更好的编辑质量和高效性。

Conclusion: EditCast3D在降低计算成本和API依赖的同时，通过视角选择和无精炼重建实现了对多视图一致性的有效保证，成为可扩展的将基础模型集成到3D编辑管线的通用范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出OmniGaze，一种半监督3D注视估计框架，利用大规模多样化的无标注人脸图片并通过伪标签和奖励模型筛选与加权伪标签，从而提高跨域泛化与零样本能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D注视估计受限于标注数据稀缺与分布不均，导致跨域泛化差，本文希望利用大量无标注且更具多样性的现实数据减小域偏差，提高估计在野外环境的通用性。

Method: 构建多样化无标注人脸图像库；用标准伪标签策略生成初始3D注视方向；设计奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，奖励模型融合：模型预测的方向向量、由视觉编码器提取的视觉嵌入、以及通过提示多模态大模型得到的语义注视视角置信度；根据奖励分数筛选高质量伪标签并按权重用于损失计算以训练模型。

Result: 在五个数据集上实现SOTA性能（在域与跨域场景），并作为可扩展数据引擎在四个未见数据集上展示稳健的零样本泛化效果。

Conclusion: OmniGaze通过结合伪标签、视觉嵌入与多模态大模型生成的语义置信度，并利用奖励模型对伪标签进行筛选与加权，显著提升了3D注视估计在多数据集上的在域与跨域性能，同时具有良好的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

TL;DR: CanvasMAR通过提供模糊全局画布作为起点并扩大时空条件引导，解决慢启动和误差累积，使自回归视频生成更快、更连贯，性能接近扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频掩码自回归模型在生成视频时灵活，但存在早期采样缺乏全局结构先验（慢启动）和自回归误差累积（时空维度）的问题。

Method: 在自回归掩码生成中加入模糊预测的画布作为初始条件；引入组合式无分类器引导同时放大空间（画布）与时间条件；使用噪声扰动的画布增强鲁棒性；在BAIR和Kinetics-600上评估性能。

Result: 提出CanvasMAR，通过引入画布机制（对下一帧的模糊全局预测）作为掩码生成的起点，并结合组合无分类器引导和基于噪声的画布增强，在BAIR和Kinetics-600上实现高质量视频生成，减少自回归步骤，与扩散方法相当。

Conclusion: 画布机制和组合无分类器引导能显著缓解MAR的慢启动与误差累积，提高生成质量与采样效率，CanvasMAR在基准数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

TL;DR: KnowCoL uses images, descriptions, and structured Wikidata knowledge to learn a shared semantic space, enabling strong zero-shot and long-tail visual entity recognition; achieves large gains on OVEN, notably +10.5% unseen accuracy with a compact model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-domain visual entity recognition faces open-set, long-tail, and ambiguous entities; need semantic grounding using external knowledge to enable zero-shot recognition.

Method: Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL): encode images and textual descriptions into a shared space, use Wikidata entity descriptions, type hierarchies, and relations as grounding; train contrastively to align modalities and leverage structured context for disambiguation and zero-shot; evaluate on OVEN.

Result: Proposed KnowCoL that maps images and text to a Wikidata-grounded semantic space using entity descriptions, type hierarchies, and relations; improved accuracy on OVEN, especially unseen/rare entities; smallest model +10.5% on unseen vs SOTA while 35x smaller.

Conclusion: Incorporating structured knowledge with contrastive learning between images and text at the conceptual level substantially improves open-domain visual entity recognition, particularly for rare/unseen entities, allowing smaller models to outperform larger baselines.

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

*Xinyang Li,Tengfei Wang,Zixiao Gu,Shengchuan Zhang,Chunchao Guo,Liujuan Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出FlashWorld，一种在秒级内从单张图像或文本生成3D场景的生成模型。通过引入双模预训练（同时支持多视角生成和直接生成3D Gaussian表示）以及跨模蒸馏的后训练，结合视频扩散模型先验和大量单视图数据，实现了比先前方法快10~100×且渲染质量更好的效果，同时保持3D一致性并减少推理去噪步数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视角先生成再重建的MV导向方法虽然能保证视觉质量，但速度慢；而直接生成3D表示的3D导向方法速度快但视觉质量往往欠佳。为同时兼顾速度、质量与3D一致性，提出结合两者优点的新范式。

Method: 方法包括：1) 利用视频扩散模型先验，进行双模多视图扩散模型的预训练，使模型同时支持MV导向（生成多视角图像后重建3D）与3D导向（直接生成3D Gaussian表示）两种生成模式；2) 提出跨模后训练蒸馏，将3D导向模式的输出分布匹配到高质量的MV导向模式，以提升视觉质量并减少推理所需去噪步数；3) 使用大量单视图图像与文本提示进行训练，以增强对分布外输入的泛化。

Result: 大量实验表明FlashWorld在速度上比先前工作快10~100×，在渲染质量与3D一致性上具有优势，同时通过减少去噪步数实现快速推理，且在单视图与文本输入泛化性良好。

Conclusion: FlashWorld在效率和渲染质量上均优于现有方法：它能在秒级生成高质量、3D一致的场景，并通过跨模后训练提升3D导向生成的视觉质量与速度，同时利用海量单视图与文本增强泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

TL;DR: 作者提出用去噪扩散桥模型，用病理图像作为结构性先验，生成更保真且选择性去病的健康反事实，在分割与异常检测上优于既有扩散模型和完全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗影像中生成健康的反事实图像有助于异常检测和兼容仅适用于健康扫描的分析工具。现有基于DDPM的方法难以在去除病变与保留个体解剖特征之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用DDBM框架，训练时把健康图像和对应合成病理图作为两端条件，令模型学习从病理到健康的桥式去噪过程；推理时以实际病理图为终点、健康先验为起点生成反事实，并在分割/异常检测任务上评估性能。

Result: 提出将去噪扩散桥模型（DDBM）用于生成反事实，利用病理图像作为结构先验，按条件在起点（健康图）和终点（合成病理图）上进行扩散，得到既去除病变又保留个体结构的反事实。

Conclusion: DDBM通过在扩散过程中同时条件化初始和最终图像，有效平衡了病变去除与个体解剖保持，提升了反事实生成质量及下游任务性能。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

*Jonghyun Park,Minhyuk Seo,Jonghyun Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RAS, a non-iterative inference-time defense that steers activations based on query-level risk by reformulating queries to emphasize safety-critical image regions, improving safety, utility, and speed over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address safety alignment in multimodal AI models by enabling them to correctly refuse malicious queries embedded in images, while avoiding excessive refusals of benign queries and reducing inference-time overhead.

Method: Reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical image regions, perform query-level risk assessment, and adaptively steer model activations to generate safe responses without iterative output adjustments.

Result: They propose Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS), which reformulates queries to focus cross-modal attention on safety-critical image regions, assesses risk at query level, and adaptively steers activations to produce safe helpful responses without iterative output adjustments; experiments show reduced attack success rates, preserved task performance, and improved inference speed.

Conclusion: RAS effectively reduces multimodal safety attacks, maintains general utility, and speeds up inference compared to earlier inference-time defenses by using risk assessment and adaptive activation steering based on query reformulation.

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多视角生成与定制化无法同时兼顾的问题——现有模型要么缺乏几何一致性的定制能力，要么缺乏显式视角控制。提出联合实现相机位姿控制与提示词定制的新任务“多视角定制”。

Method: 训练阶段：用特征场表示主体身份与几何，结合文本到视频扩散骨干与稠密时空注意力学习时空一致性。推理阶段：深度感知特征渲染以强制几何一致，一致性感知潜在补全以确保定制主体和背景的透视对齐。

Result: 提出MVCustom：基于扩散的框架，在训练阶段用特征场表示学习主体身份与几何，并在文本到视频扩散骨干上加入稠密时空注意力以利用时间一致性；推理阶段引入深度感知特征渲染和一致性感知潜在补全，分别用于几何一致性和视角对齐。实验表明MVCustom是唯一同时实现多视角生成和定制化的框架。

Conclusion: MVCustom成功在稀少定制数据下实现了几何一致的多视角生成与高保真定制，填补了多视角生成和定制化之间的空白。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

Conclusion: 结合学习型骨架化和图连接可以可靠提取解剖学可信的CoW中心线，提取的形态特征稳健，可用于变异检测与理论验证，并推动后续研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

*Aymeric Fleith,Julian Zirbel,Daniel Cremers,Niclas Zeller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiFMCR is a new dual-plenoptic-camera dataset with Vicon ground truth plus two plenoptic-aware registration baselines enabling accurate multi-camera light field registration


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing light field datasets limited to single-camera setups and lack external ground truth for multi-camera registration

Method: Dataset + methods

Result: LiFMCR: synchronized sequences from two Raytrix R32 plenoptic cameras with Vicon 6-DoF poses; two baseline algorithms (RANSAC-based 3D transform from cross-view point clouds; plenoptic PnP estimating extrinsics from single light field images) showing strong alignment with ground truth

Conclusion: LiFMCR enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration; provided algorithms demonstrate accurate, scalable registration aligned with motion-capture ground truth

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CSS-Diff，通过循环一致性约束、片间对比学习和局部自重构模块，从真实低场MRI合成高场MRI，兼顾像素和解剖保真，达到SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高低场MRI到高场MRI合成的临床保真性，保持解剖结构并增强细节，解决图像对比域差异问题。

Method: 基于扩散模型的生成框架引入循环一致性损失；片-wise gap perception网络用对比学习对齐切片间不一致；局部结构修复网络通过对被掩码和扰动的局部补丁进行自重构来提升局部细节恢复。

Result: 提出循环自监督扩散（CSS-Diff）框架，在扩散生成过程中引入循环一致性约束，添加片间差异感知网络（对比学习）和局部结构修复网络（掩码/扰动自重构），在跨场合成任务上实现了SOTA性能（PSNR 31.80 dB, SSIM 0.943, LPIPS 0.0864）并显著提高解剖结构保真度（白质误差从12.1%降到2.1%）。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff在保证量化指标的同时显著提升了解剖结构一致性，可用于降低高场MRI采集依赖并扩展可用数据。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LSGC以对长距离连接进行对数级限制，构建LogViG（混合CNN-GNN）并加入高分辨率多尺度分支；在分类和分割任务上超越现有ViG/CNN/ViT，效率和精度均提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve graph construction for Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) by addressing inefficiencies of existing methods (e.g., KNN, SVGA) on large images and issues like over-squashing due to fixed step scales. The goal is to limit long-range links while preserving useful connectivity to enhance performance and efficiency.

Method: Design LSGC to connect nodes with logarithmically scaled long-range links, integrate it into a hybrid CNN-GNN architecture (LogViG), add a high-resolution branch and fusion between branches for multi-scale features, and evaluate on ImageNet-1K and semantic segmentation benchmarks comparing accuracy, parameter count, and GMACs.

Result: They propose Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) and build LogViG, a hybrid CNN-GNN using LSGC plus a high-resolution multi-scale branch. Experiments show LogViG outperforms existing ViG, CNN, and ViT models on ImageNet-1K and segmentation, achieving higher accuracy with fewer parameters and GMACs; Ti-LogViG obtains 79.9% top-1 accuracy, +1.7% over Vision GNN, with 24.3% fewer params and 35.3% fewer GMACs.

Conclusion: Leveraging logarithmically limited long-range links in graph construction (LSGC) enables ViGs to surpass current state-of-the-art in accuracy and efficiency; LogViG demonstrates that careful graph sparsification plus multi-scale high-resolution fusion yields better performance with fewer resources.

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

*Tianshuo Xu,Kai Wang,Zhifei Chen,Leyi Wu,Tianshui Wen,Fei Chao,Ying-Cong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该文提出UniCalli，一个用于列级中文书法识别与生成的统一扩散框架，通过联合训练识别与生成任务，实现风格与结构约束的协同提升，使用不对称噪声和栅格化盒图作为空间先验，并在~8k作品数据集上取得了更好的连笔、布局忠实度和识别性能，可扩展到其他古代文字。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成高质量单字与保持页面级美学之间存在权衡，或生成页面但牺牲书法正确性；因此需要一个在列级别上同时兼顾识别与生成的统一框架，以保持字形正确性与页面美学（连笔、间距、布局）。

Method: 提出一个统一的扩散模型，同时训练列级识别与列级生成；使用不对称噪声（针对识别与生成不同的噪声策略）以及将文字位置信息编码为栅格化盒图作为空间先验；训练数据由合成数据、有标注的真实数据与无标注数据混合构成；识别任务为约束生成器保持字符结构，生成任务提供风格与布局先验，两者协同学习实现概念级抽象。

Result: 在约8000件数字化作品（其中~4000件密集标注）上训练并评估，UniCalli在生成质量、连笔连续性与布局忠实度上达到SOTA，同时识别性能也有所提升；该框架还能扩展到甲骨文和埃及象形文字等其他古文字。

Conclusion: UniCalli通过联合训练识别与生成任务、引入不对称加噪与栅格化盒图空间先验，并利用合成/有标注/无标注混合数据，成功实现了在列级别上既保持书法正确性又具有页面美学的生成，同时提升了识别性能，并能推广到其他古文字。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Result: 设计并训练了InteractiveOmni系列（4B/8B），构建多轮训练数据与评测基准，在多项图像/音频/视频理解及语音生成任务上超越同类开源模型，4B接近7B模型表现，4B仅用50%参数保留8B的97%性能

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni实现了轻量化与高性能的平衡，适合用于下一代多轮音视频交互系统，提供了开放资源与评测工具推动社区发展。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

TL;DR: RECODE converts images to executable code via candidate program generation and critic-guided selection/refinement, enabling verifiable visual reasoning and better performance on chart/diagram benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to improve precise visual reasoning for structured visuals (charts, diagrams) where pixel-based MLLMs lack verification mechanisms, by leveraging derendering to executable code to enable verifiable reasoning.

Method: Generate multiple candidate programs to reproduce the image, use a critic to pick the most faithful program, iteratively refine code; use the executable reconstruction for downstream precise calculations and inferences; evaluated on benchmarks showing substantial improvements.

Result: They propose RECODE, which generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce input images, uses a critic to select and iteratively refine the best reconstruction, transforming perception into verifiable symbolic problems and enabling precise calculations; RECODE significantly outperforms baselines on CharXiv, ChartQA, Geometry3K.

Conclusion: Grounding visual perception in executable code yields more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning; derendering is an effective modality for structured visual tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Motivation: 当前基准无法充分检验多模态模型生成与理解的真实整合——要么把两者分开测试，要么忽略二者本质耦合的任务，因而需要一个系统性且学科敏感的评测以揭示二者的相互促进情况。

Method: 构建八个面向推理的学科领域任务（如科学、编码、数学、谜题），并为每个任务设计双向耦合的任务形式：从理解引导精确视觉合成，以及利用生成作为分析推理的认知支架；引入可验证的中间推理步骤、唯一真值和可复现的文本与视觉输出评分协议；对比评估统一模型、仅生成模型和仅理解模型。

Result: 通过广泛评测，发现统一模型、生成型模型与理解型模型在不同任务上存在显著性能差异，且存在明显的跨模态依赖关系；该基准揭示了何时以及如何生成与理解相互增强，为统一模型的进步提供了可靠基线。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了Uni-MMMU评测基准，用于评估统一多模态模型在理解与生成之间的双向协同能力，并通过实验证明当前模型在任务上存在显著差距，强调了跨模态依赖与增强潜力。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

TL;DR: 把4D fMRI转成2D平面图视频，用Spatiotemporal MAE在大规模HCP数据上预训练Vision Transformer；性能随数据量按幂律提升，获得可用于跨被试状态和个体特征解码的强表示，并开源资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习模型（尤其视觉Transformer）在自然图像上的成功未直接适配到4D体积fMRI；需要一种能桥接fMRI与自然图像模态差异的表示方法，以便利用现有视觉模型架构和自监督训练框架来学习有用的大规模fMRI表征，促进跨任务、跨个体的泛化。

Method: 将4D fMRI体积投影为一系列2D平面活动平面图（flat maps）构成视频输入；采用Vision Transformer架构并使用Spatiotemporal Masked Autoencoder（MAE）进行自监督预训练；训练数据来自Human Connectome Project，约2.3K小时；分析掩码建模性能随数据规模的幂律关系；在下游分类任务（跨被试状态解码和个体特征解码）上评估表示质量。

Result: 掩码fMRI建模性能随着训练数据规模严格遵循幂律提升；预训练模型在下游任务中表现出能区分细粒度脑状态（跨被试）和解码个体特征（跨状态变化）的能力；公开了代码和数据，支持社区复现与扩展。

Conclusion: 本文提出将4D体积fMRI数据转换为2D平面活动图视频，并在此表示上使用Spatiotemporal MAE训练Vision Transformer，从而在大规模fMRI数据上学习表征；实验表明掩码自编码性能随数据量呈幂律改善，所学表示在跨被试状态解码和个体特征解码上均有效，推动构建fMRI基础模型的开放科学工作。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation

TL;DR: AVC uses CLIP retrieval and adaptive conditioning during diffusion plus re-captioning dataset


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: improve story continuation by adapting use of prior visual context and improving captions

Method: analysis of methods

Result: better coherence and fidelity vs baselines

Conclusion: AVC balances using prior visuals and ignoring misleading ones, yields superior results

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

Conclusion: 提出一种轻量级水印方案NoisePrints，通过利用扩散过程的随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成模型即可实现第三方验证。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner构建了统一且紧凑的图像块级3D表示，推动了3D视觉定位与空间推理的融合，且GCoT数据集促进将定位作为推理核心，从而实现更强的空间推理能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出Trajectory Field，把每个像素映射到随时间连续变化的3D轨迹，设计Trace Anything网络一次前向预测每像素B样条轨迹，达到新基准SOTA、效率高并展示多项下游能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Propose a continuous spatio-temporal representation for videos using pixel-wise 3D trajectories to better model dynamics.

Method: 将每像素的3D轨迹参数化为一组控制点（B样条），训练神经网络在单次前向传播中预测整个轨迹场；在大规模4D数据上训练并评估，包括新建平台数据，展示准确性与效率。

Result: Introduce Trajectory Field representation and Trace Anything network predicting per-pixel B-spline control points; achieve SOTA on new benchmark, competitive on tracking, efficient one-pass, emergent abilities like goal-conditioned manipulation and motion forecasting.

Conclusion: Trajectory Field和Trace Anything提供了一种高效、统一的像素级时空动态表示，可用于跟踪、预测和操作等任务，显示出良好性能和泛化潜力。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ViVerBench基准、构建大规模训练数据并训练OmniVerifier-7B、以及提出OmniVerifier-TTS的测试时序扩展方法，显著提升视觉验证与生成编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM在视觉结果的可靠验证上远落后于人类，需要一个通用的可生成验证器来提供反思、修正以及测试时可扩展的精细化能力，从而提升生成与推理的可靠性与可控性。

Method: 构建ViVerBench评估16类视觉验证任务；用两套自动化流水线构造大规模训练数据；训练OmniVerifier-7B并提出OmniVerifier-TTS在测试时迭代优化生成与编辑；进行跨基准实验对比Best-of-N等并扩展到世界建模交错推理场景。

Result: 该工作提出了Generative Universal Verifier（通用生成型验证器，OmniVerifier），用于在视觉-语言模型与统一多模态模型中实现可反思和可细化的视觉结果验证与优化。

Conclusion: OmniVerifier通过训练发现了视觉验证的三个原子能力并将其用于可迭代的测试时细化，在多个基准上优于现有方法，推动更可靠可控的多模态推理与生成。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

*Dominick Reilly,Manish Kumar Govind,Le Xue,Srijan Das*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VisCoP：在VLM视觉编码器中加入可学习的视觉探针，进行高效的领域适配，能提升目标域表现并保留源域知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉-语言模型在面对与预训练数据分布差异较大的新领域时性能显著下降，现有微调方法要么改动过多导致遗忘，要么学不到领域特征，需一种既高效又能保留原能力的适配方案。

Method: 在视觉编码器中插入一小组可学习的视觉探针（visual probes），只训练这些探针以适配新域，保持VLM其余部分冻结或微小调整，结合特定损失与训练策略进行优化。

Result: VisCoP通过在视觉编码器前引入一组小规模可学习视觉探针，实现低成本的领域自适应，同时保持原有模型能力。该方法在跨视角、跨模态和跨任务三种设置上均优于现有策略。

Conclusion: VisCoP能在最小修改预训练参数的前提下，有效学习领域特定特征，避免灾难性遗忘，并在多种领域迁移场景下取得最佳性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

TL;DR: PhysMaster通过PhysEncoder从单张图像学习物理表征，并用DPO基于人类反馈的强化学习优化，作为可插拔模块提升视频生成的物理合理性及泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成虽在视觉上真实，但常违背物理规律，限制其作为“世界模型”的能力；因此需要将物理知识编码进生成过程以提高物理合理性。

Method: 提出PhysEncoder从单张图像提取物理先验作为额外条件注入视频生成网络，并使用强化学习与人类偏好（DPO）对物理表示进行端到端优化，利用生成模型的反馈作为监督信号。

Result: 在简单代理任务和多种物理场景上验证了PhysMaster的效果，证明其能改善物理感知并具有良好的泛化性，可作为通用插件用于物理意识视频生成。

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过学习图像到视频的物理表示，并用强化学习结合人类反馈（DPO）优化该表示，从而提升视频生成模型的物理一致性。

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

TL;DR: 系统性分类并实证比较了主流SQL脱敏系统，揭示隐私模型、保护单元与架构选择如何影响隐私、效用与性能的权衡，并提出改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析性SQL查询在提供洞见的同时带来隐私泄露风险，现有多种脱敏系统设计分散且特性差异大，研究者和从业者难以比较和选择合适方案，因此需要系统性分类与实证评估以厘清现状和指导实践。

Method: 通过构建分类框架（基于隐私模型、隐私单元、软件架构和支持的查询范围）对现有SQL脱敏系统进行定性比较；并选取若干代表性系统进行实证基准测试，测量在一系列分析查询下的数据效用、查询执行开销和隐私保证，进行定量对比分析。

Result: 给出一套基于关键设计维度的系统分类，展示不同系统在支持查询类型、隐私模型和架构上的差异；实证结果揭示：基于k-匿名的系统在某些查询下保留较高效用但风险模型弱；差分隐私系统提供更强形式化保障但在复杂分析查询中损失效用或开销较大；代理式与集成式架构在性能和部署灵活性上各有利弊。并总结出针对未来研究的建议。

Conclusion: 该论文对SQL查询脱敏系统进行了系统分类与实证评估，识别出不同设计选择对隐私-效用-性能权衡的影响，指出现有系统在功能覆盖、隐私保障与查询性能方面存在明显权衡和不足，并提出未来改进方向。

Abstract: Analytical SQL queries are essential for extracting insights from relational
databases but concurrently introduce significant privacy risks by potentially
exposing sensitive information. To mitigate these risks, numerous query
sanitization systems have been developed, employing diverse approaches that
create a complex landscape for both researchers and practitioners. These
systems vary fundamentally in their design, including the underlying privacy
model, such as k-anonymity or Differential Privacy; the protected privacy unit,
whether at the tuple- or user-level; and the software architecture, which can
be proxy-based or integrated. This paper provides a systematic classification
of state-of-the-art SQL sanitization systems based on these qualitative
criteria and the scope of queries they support. Furthermore, we present a
quantitative analysis of leading systems, empirically measuring the trade-offs
between data utility, query execution overhead, and privacy guarantees across a
range of analytical queries. This work offers a structured overview and
performance assessment intended to clarify the capabilities and limitations of
current privacy-preserving database technologies.

*Mahdi Esmailoghli,Matthias Weidlich*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: Paper proposes adding temporal dimension to data discovery in data lakes by inferring versions, lineage, and change logs to enable time-aware queries even without explicit timestamps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data relevance changes over time but discovery systems ignore temporal aspects, especially without timestamps; need to incorporate temporal validity.

Method: Proposes techniques: version discovery, temporal lineage inference, change log synthesis, and time-aware data discovery; presents a system architecture integrating these components and discusses research challenges.

Result: Defines temporally-valid data discovery problem; proposes techniques: version discovery, temporal lineage inference, change log synthesis, time-aware discovery; presents system architecture and outlines challenges.

Conclusion: A new class of time-aware data discovery systems is needed; outlined architecture and research challenges to support evolving data lakes.

Abstract: Over the past decade, the proliferation of public and enterprise data lakes
has fueled intensive research into data discovery, aiming to identify the most
relevant data from vast and complex corpora to support diverse user tasks.
Significant progress has been made through the development of innovative index
structures, similarity measures, and querying infrastructures. Despite these
advances, a critical aspect remains overlooked: relevance is time-varying.
Existing discovery methods largely ignore this temporal dimension, especially
when explicit date/time metadata is missing. To fill this gap, we outline a
vision for a data discovery system that incorporates the temporal dimension of
data. Specifically, we define the problem of temporally-valid data discovery
and argue that addressing it requires techniques for version discovery,
temporal lineage inference, change log synthesis, and time-aware data
discovery. We then present a system architecture to deliver these techniques,
before we summarize research challenges and opportunities. As such, we lay the
foundation for a new class of data discovery systems, transforming how we
interact with evolving data lakes.
