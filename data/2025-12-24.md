### [1] [PHANTOM: PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing Connected Vehicle Mobility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19711)
*Md Nahid Hasan Shuvo,Moinul Hossain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHANTOM leverages anamorphic art to create perspective-dependent physical adversarial examples that fool multiple detectors in black-box settings, causing both perception failures and V2X-level disruptions in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Connected autonomous vehicles depend on vision-based DNNs and V2X for safe navigation; physical adversarial attacks threaten these systems.

Method: Generate anamorphic artworks that exploit geometric distortions to create perspective-dependent adversarial patches; test transferability across YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet; evaluate in CARLA and SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulations across conditions.

Result: PHANTOM, using anamorphic art, crafts perspective-dependent adversarial examples effective in black-box settings and transferable across detectors, achieving high attack success rates and causing network-wide disruption in CAV simulations.

Conclusion: CAV perception and communication layers are vulnerable to perspective-dependent physical attacks; defenses must address both perception robustness and V2X message validation.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

*SaiKiran Tedla,Kelly Zhu,Trevor Canham,Felix Taubner,Michael S. Brown,Kiriakos N. Kutulakos,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于互联网级视频扩散模型的盲去模糊到视频方法，能从单张模糊图像恢复拍摄瞬间及前后帧，效果优于以往方法并支持多种下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动模糊虽然掩盖细节，但编码了曝光期间场景和相机运动信息；现有方法受限于手工先验和小数据规模，难以重建复杂动态，也不恢复发生前后的情景，故希望利用大规模视频先验改善恢复效果。

Method: 方法基于在互联网规模数据上预训练的视频扩散模型，通过条件化模糊图像来生成时间一致的视频序列，利用模型的先验来解决模糊到视频的逆问题，从而避免手工先验和专门网络结构。

Result: 新方法在该任务上优于现有方法，对真实复杂图像有良好泛化能力，并支持恢复相机轨迹、物体运动和动态3D结构；作者提供了代码和数据。

Conclusion: 本文提出将预训练视频扩散模型重新用于从运动模糊图像中恢复视频，能够生成拍摄瞬间的复杂场景动态以及立即之前或之后的帧，并能用于恢复相机轨迹、物体运动和动态三维结构。

Abstract: We seek to answer the question: what can a motion-blurred image reveal about a scene's past, present, and future? Although motion blur obscures image details and degrades visual quality, it also encodes information about scene and camera motion during an exposure. Previous techniques leverage this information to estimate a sharp image from an input blurry one, or to predict a sequence of video frames showing what might have occurred at the moment of image capture. However, they rely on handcrafted priors or network architectures to resolve ambiguities in this inverse problem, and do not incorporate image and video priors on large-scale datasets. As such, existing methods struggle to reproduce complex scene dynamics and do not attempt to recover what occurred before or after an image was taken. Here, we introduce a new technique that repurposes a pre-trained video diffusion model trained on internet-scale datasets to recover videos revealing complex scene dynamics during the moment of capture and what might have occurred immediately into the past or future. Our approach is robust and versatile; it outperforms previous methods for this task, generalizes to challenging in-the-wild images, and supports downstream tasks such as recovering camera trajectories, object motion, and dynamic 3D scene structure.

### [3] [Learning to Refocus with Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19823)
*SaiKiran Tedla,Zhoutong Zhang,Xuaner Zhang,Shumian Xin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于视频扩散模型的单张缺焦图像后期对焦方法，从单张图生成感知准确的焦平面序列（视频），并发布大规模真实智能手机焦平面数据集，方法在感知质量和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动对焦经常不能捕捉到用户意图，被拍对象可能缺焦，用户希望在拍摄后调整焦点，因此需要从单张缺焦图恢复或生成不同焦点的图像序列以实现交互式后期对焦。

Method: 利用视频扩散模型对单张缺焦图进行条件生成，生成一个代表不同焦点的时间序列（焦平面视频），并通过在大规模真实手机焦平面数据集上训练/微调来提高质量和鲁棒性。

Result: 在多种具有挑战性的真实场景下，该方法在感知质量和稳健性指标上均优于现有方法，提供更真实的对焦变化效果，并已开源代码和数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能从单张缺焦图生成真实且可交互的焦平面视频，实现后期对焦并支持多种下游应用，且在真实手机场景下表现优于先前方法，推动了日常摄影的对焦编辑能力。

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

### [4] [RANSAC Scoring Functions: Analysis and Reality Check](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19850)
*A. Shekhovtsov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对RANSAC中用于给候选几何模型打分的评分函数进行了系统性重审：从概率模型出发，推广高斯噪声下的几何误差到球面噪声，并在考虑均匀分布离群点的混合模型下，把基于阈值的参数化归纳为似然方法与鲁棒M估计的统一视角；分析并揭示了MAGSAC++的得分函数实质等价于高斯-均匀似然；最后提出了评价评分函数的实验方法（大验证集或小随机验证集期望），并在实验中发现各种评分函数表现无显著差异，MAGSAC++并不优于更简单方法，也对阈值不更不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 明确并统一RANSAC中评分函数的概率基础与鲁棒性处理，检验现有领先方法（如MAGSAC++）的理论与数值合理性，提供可靠的实验评估流程，以便指导后续改进与应用。

Method: 从概率建模出发，先将传统高斯噪声下的几何误差推广到球面噪声；引入高斯-均匀混合模型处理离群点，并用阈值参数化将似然估计与M估计连接；数学推导显示MAGSAC++得分等价于高斯-均匀似然；提出两种实验评价方案（大验证集或小随机验证集的期望），并通过实验比较多种评分函数与学习型分布。

Result: 理论上构建了统一框架，证明MAGSAC++得分与简单高斯-均匀模型等价；实验上在不同验证集设定下发现所有评分函数（包括学习型）表现一致，且复杂方法并不明显优于简单对手。

Conclusion: MAGSAC++的推导存在问题，其得分函数实际上是简单的高斯-均匀似然；在统一概率框架下，所有评估的评分函数在合理的验证设置下表现相同，说明没有证据表明复杂方法优于简单基线。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [5] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ fuses Gaussian-based continuous depth and depth-bin representations for better BEV features and uses BEV edge maps as auxiliary cues, yielding superior 3D panoptic occupancy results on Occ3D-nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D panoptic occupancy methods struggle with precise geometric reasoning and capturing spatial extents of instances, leading to poor panoptic separation and geometry consistency.

Method: Combine a hybrid view-transformation branch fusing continuous 3D Gaussian depth and discretized depth-bin features to produce BEV; extract BEV edge maps as auxiliary supervision to learn edges; train and evaluate on Occ3D-nuScenes.

Result: HyGE-Occ, a framework using hybrid view-transformation with continuous 3D Gaussian depth and discretized depth-bin fusion plus BEV edge priors, improves geometric consistency and boundary awareness, outperforming prior work on Occ3D-nuScenes.

Conclusion: Hybrid depth representations and edge-aware BEV features enhance geometry and boundary localization, improving 3D panoptic occupancy performance.

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

### [6] [Widget2Code: From Visual Widgets to UI Code via Multimodal LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19918)
*Houston H. Zhang,Tao Zhang,Baoze Lin,Yuanqi Xue,Yincheng Zhu,Huan Liu,Li Gu,Linfeng Ye,Ziqiang Wang,Xinxin Zuo,Yang Wang,Yuanhao Yu,Zhixiang Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Widget2Code任务和基准，聚焦小型App组件的图像到代码生成，提出WidgetFactory系统、WidgetDSL及编译器，并通过图像驱动的感知与布局改进视觉一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI2Code主要面向网页与移动界面，widgets作为紧凑、无上下文的微界面且缺乏公开标注，成为未被充分研究的领域，需要新的基准与方法应对空间约束与图像驱动的生成难题。

Method: 在感知层，采用基于设计原则的原子组件组合策略、图标检索与可复用可视化模块；在系统层，设计框架无关的WidgetDSL和可编译到React/HTML/CSS等前端实现的编译器，并加入自适应渲染模块来微调空间尺寸。

Result: 基准实验显示通用多模态大模型虽优于专门方法但仍不稳健；提出的联合感知与结构化生成基线在视觉保真度上有显著提升，提供了统一的基础设施和实现多前端编译器。

Conclusion: 作者建立了面向widgets的图像到代码基准和强基线，提出了WidgetFactory流水线与WidgetDSL，显著提升了生成代码的视觉保真度，为后续Widget2Code研究提供统一基础设施。

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

### [7] [Unified Brain Surface and Volume Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19928)
*S. Mazdak Abulnaga,Andrew Hoopes,Malte Hoffmann,Robin Magnet,Maks Ovsjanikov,Lilla Zöllei,John Guttag,Bruce Fischl,Adrian Dalca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NeurAlign：一个利用球面中间空间，将体积与表面联合对齐的深度学习框架，准确且快速地注册脑MRI，性能优于传统和ML方法，Dice提高最多7点且变形场规则，推理更快且易用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法将体积与表面分开配准导致的不一致性，提供一个统一的、几何一致且快速的联合配准框架。

Method: 通过将脑表面拓扑映射到球面坐标中作为桥接，模型在训练时同时优化体积配准和球面配准损失，确保体积与表面在形变字段上的几何一致性；推理只需输入MRI扫描。

Result: NeurAlign jointly registers cortical surfaces and subcortical volumes using a shared volume-and-surface representation with a spherical coordinate intermediate, producing anatomically coherent alignments.

Conclusion: NeurAlign在多数据集上展示了优越的注册准确性、几何一致性和速度，提供了一个简便且高效的联合皮质与亚皮质注册解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

### [8] [Vehicle-centric Perception via Multimodal Structured Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19934)
*Wentao Wu,Xiao Wang,Chenglong Li,Jin Tang,Bin Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VehicleMAE-V2在masked重建中融入对称性、轮廓和语义三种车辆结构先验，并通过大规模Autobot4M预训练，显著提升车辆中心感知任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练方法未有效学习车辆相关知识，导致对车辆感知的通用表示建模能力不足。

Method: 设计了三模块：对称性引导掩码模块(SMM)避免保留对称patch并减少冗余；轮廓引导表示模块(CRM)通过最小化轮廓与重建特征分布差异保留整体结构；语义引导表示模块(SRM)通过对比学习与跨模态蒸馏对齐图文特征，提升语义理解。

Result: 提出VehicleMAE-V2，通过引入车辆多模态结构先验（对称性、轮廓、语义）来指导masked token重建，提高车辆感知表示的泛化能力，并构建了约4M图像和12,693文本的Autobot4M数据集；在五个下游任务上表现优越。

Conclusion: VehicleMAE-V2有效集成多模态结构先验，改进掩码重建机制，提升车辆感知特征的质量；Autobot4M为预训练提供了大规模资源，实验证明在多任务上有明显优势。

Abstract: Vehicle-centric perception plays a crucial role in many intelligent systems, including large-scale surveillance systems, intelligent transportation, and autonomous driving. Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.

### [9] [Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941)
*Mozes Jacobs,Thomas Fel,Richard Hakim,Alessandra Brondetta,Demba Ba,T. Andy Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者提出Block-Recurrent Hypothesis并用Raptor证明ViT深度可以被少量循环块近似，恢复大部分性能；基于此进行动力学可解释性分析，发现收敛、令牌特化与低秩化趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为Transformer深度的计算提供一种明确的动力学框架，解释为什么ViT深层次表现出可重复、低复杂度的计算结构，便于用动力学系统工具分析。

Method: 通过分析层间表征相似性矩阵发现相位结构；构造并训练块递归替代模型Raptor以拟合预训练ViT；评估拟合精度、与stochastic depth的关系，并进行动力学可解释性分析（轨迹、令牌特异性、低秩更新）。

Result: 在不同ViT上发现相邻层形成少量相位；训练Raptor能用极少块数（例如2块）恢复大部分性能（96% DINOv2线性探针）；展示了收敛到类依赖角盆、令牌特异动态和深层低秩更新等动力学现象。

Conclusion: ViTs在深度方向上呈现可重复的块递归结构，训练过的模型的L个块可以用少量k个不同块循环应用来近似。

Abstract: As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.

### [10] [SE360: Semantic Edit in 360$^\circ$ Panoramas via Hierarchical Data Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19943)
*Haoyi Zhong,Fang-Lue Zhang,Andrew Chalmers,Taehyun Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SE360：自动生成训练对、利用VLM和自适应投影保证语义与几何一致，并用两阶段精炼提升真实感，训练Transformer扩散模型实现文本/遮罩/参考图像引导的360°对象编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面向360°全景图的指令式图像编辑在ERP及透视视图上常生成不合理结果，需保证对象及其物理环境的整体一致性并减少手工标注。

Method: 基于无监督全景图，使用VLM与自适应投影进行粗到细的数据自动生成，随后用两阶段低成本数据精炼，最后训练Transformer扩散模型支持多条件编辑。

Result: SE360提出了一种用于360°全景图中多条件引导目标编辑的新框架，通过自主数据生成、分层分析以及两阶段数据精炼，提高编辑的语义一致性和几何一致性。

Conclusion: SE360在生成数据的语义和几何一致性、减少擦除伪影以及编辑结果的视觉质量和语义准确性上优于现有方法。

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过模型无关的浅层读出评估，作者发现大规模视频预训练的模型能自发学到显著三维知识，且在部分三维任务上优于专用三维模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在仅以2D视频数据进行预训练的情况下，是否以及在何种程度上会自然产生对三维世界的理解，这对构建可扩展的三维模型具有重要启发意义。

Method: 提出一个模型无关的评估框架：通过对不同VidFMs的特征进行浅层线性/小网络读出（read-outs），估计多个三维属性（如深度、法线、视点、尺度、三维物体类别等），并以标准化指标比较性能。

Result: 发现现有最先进的视频生成模型在三维物体与场景理解上表现强劲，甚至在某些三维任务上超过了专门训练的三维模型；同时给出多模型、多任务的三维基准评测结果。

Conclusion: 视频基础模型在大规模视频预训练后确实会自发获得相当程度的三维理解能力。

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

TL;DR: HistoWAS将GIS点模式拓扑特征引入WSI病理图像分析，并结合PheWAS式大规模回归，能够把组织空间组织与临床结局关联；在KPMP数据上完成102特征的应用验证并开源代码数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺乏工具以衡量组织微观和宏观空间相互作用与临床参数关联的问题，提升WSI病理图像的空间分析能力与生物标志物发现潜力。

Method: 构建特征空间：在72个常规对象级特征基础上增加30个改编自GIS点模式分析的拓扑和空间特征；构建关联研究引擎：对每个特征进行单变量回归（类似PheWAS），并对多重检验进行统计校正；在KPMP PAS染色WSI数据集上进行示范性应用与验证，开源实现。

Result: 提出HistoWAS框架，包含扩展的特征空间（在常规指标基础上增加30个来自GIS点模式分析的拓扑与空间特征）和一个类PheWAS的关联分析引擎，可对每个特征进行大规模单变量回归并做统计校正；在KPMP的385张PAS染色WSI（206名参与者）上验证，共分析102项特征，代码与数据已开源。

Conclusion: HistoWAS为连接组织空间组织学特征与临床结果提供了可扩展与可重现的计算框架，丰富了pathomics分析工具箱并促进基于空间组织学的生物标志物发现。

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

Motivation: 现有MIL方法未充分建模WSI中实例间的复杂语义关系；Transformer方法虽能建模实例依赖但计算复杂度为二次，难以扩展；且固定尺度注意力难以处理不同WSI中肿瘤区域尺度变化和距离衰减相关性。

Method: 包括(1) 窗口尺度衰减注意力模块：先用聚类采样减少实例数量，再在多级递减的窗口尺度内计算注意力以捕捉不同尺度的局部相关；(2) 基于squeeze-and-excitation的区域门控模块：动态调节不同窗口/区域的权重以增强全局信息建模。

Result: 提出WSD-MIL，在保持或提升性能的同时将计算内存减少约62%，并在CAMELYON16和TCGA-BRCA上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: WSD-MIL有效兼顾多尺度局部关系建模与全局信息整合，显著降低计算内存并在两数据集上达到或超越现有方法。

Abstract: In recent years, the integration of pre-trained foundational models with multiple instance learning (MIL) has improved diagnostic accuracy in computational pathology. However, existing MIL methods focus on optimizing feature extractors and aggregation strategies while overlooking the complex semantic relationships among instances within whole slide image (WSI). Although Transformer-based MIL approaches aiming to model instance dependencies, the quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability to large-scale WSIs. Moreover, due to the pronounced variations in tumor region scales across different WSIs, existing Transformer-based methods employing fixed-scale attention mechanisms face significant challenges in precisely capturing local instance correlations and fail to account for the distance-based decay effect of patch relevance. To address these challenges, we propose window scale decay MIL (WSD-MIL), designed to enhance the capacity to model tumor regions of varying scales while improving computational efficiency. WSD-MIL comprises: 1) a window scale decay based attention module, which employs a cluster-based sampling strategy to reduce computational costs while progressively decaying attention window-scale to capture local instance relationships at varying scales; and 2) a squeeze-and-excitation based region gate module, which dynamically adjusts window weights to enhance global information modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that WSD-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CAMELYON16 and TCGA-BRCA datasets while reducing 62% of the computational memory. The code will be publicly available.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DDTM，一种双分支弱监督框架，用于跨分辨率地物覆盖制图，结合扩散分支逐步细化局部语义和Transformer分支保证全局一致性，并用伪标签置信度模块抑制噪声，在Chesapeake Bay基准上达到66.52% mIoU，优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨分辨率监督存在严重的空间分辨率不匹配，导致细粒度结构与粗标签对齐困难，现有弱监督方法易受噪声影响，需同时兼顾局部细节恢复与全局一致性。

Method: 模型采用双分支架构：1) 扩散分支（diffusion-based）在粗标签监督下逐步生成细粒度语义；2) Transformer分支用于长程上下文一致性约束。两分支通过策略融合输出高分辨率预测；同时设计伪标签置信度评估模块，选择可靠伪标签进行训练。

Result: 在Chesapeake Bay数据集上，DDTM达到66.52% mIoU，显著优于现有弱监督方法，证明了方法在抑制跨分辨率噪声和恢复细节方面的有效性。

Conclusion: DDTM通过局部扩散细化与全局Transformer融合，并用置信度筛选伪标签，有效缓解分辨率不匹配导致的噪声，实现了在Chesapeake Bay基准上新的SOTA（66.52% mIoU）。

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

TL;DR: 提出MIVA：可插拔轻量子网络，用于扩展预训练扩散模型实现精确图像到视频运动控制。每个MIVA学习单一运动模式，仅需少量样本与单卡训练即可；推理时可并行组合多个MIVA以指定复杂运动。实验显示其在更小训练数据下仍能保持或优于大规模训练模型的生成质量与运动控制精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像和视频生成上表现强，但在图像动画上因视频数据高维导致训练样本稀缺、模型更倾向记忆运动而非服从提示，以及对训练外新运动泛化能力差，且有限数据下微调困难，因此需要一种高效、可控且少样本可训练的解决方案。

Method: 在预训练扩散模型上附加轻量级子网络（MIVA），每个子网络负责学习一种运动模式；子网络可并行组合以实现复合运动；训练仅需约十个样本和单张消费级GPU。

Result: 实验表明MIVA在小样本训练下能提供更精确的运动控制，并在生成质量上保持或超越那些使用更大量数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: MIVA通过模块化、可并行扩展的适配器成功在预训练扩散模型上实现了高效、可控的图像动画，解决了数据稀缺和对新运动泛化差的问题，并在有限样本设置下取得了优于或接近大规模模型的质量与可控性。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently achieved impressive photorealism in image and video generation. However, their application to image animation remains limited, even when trained on large-scale datasets. Two primary challenges contribute to this: the high dimensionality of video signals leads to a scarcity of training data, causing DMs to favor memorization over prompt compliance when generating motion; moreover, DMs struggle to generalize to novel motion patterns not present in the training set, and fine-tuning them to learn such patterns, especially using limited training data, is still under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose Modular Image-to-Video Adapter (MIVA), a lightweight sub-network attachable to a pre-trained DM, each designed to capture a single motion pattern and scalable via parallelization. MIVAs can be efficiently trained on approximately ten samples using a single consumer-grade GPU. At inference time, users can specify motion by selecting one or multiple MIVAs, eliminating the need for prompt engineering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIVA enables more precise motion control while maintaining, or even surpassing, the generation quality of models trained on significantly larger datasets.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LaSeRS数据集与SegEarth-R2模型，解决遥感影像中复杂语言到像素的映射问题，覆盖层级粒度、多目标、推理和语言多样性四维挑战，并通过空间注意力监督与灵活分割查询提升小目标定位与多目标处理能力，在基准上表现优秀。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型只能处理简单单目标指令，难以应对复杂地理场景（多粒度、多目标、隐含意图与推理），而现有数据集过于简化，导致在真实应用中易失败，因此需要更全面的数据与模型。

Method: 构建大规模四维度标注数据集LaSeRS（层级粒度、目标多重性、推理需求、语言多样性）；提出SegEarth-R2多模态大模型，包含空间注意力监督用于改善小目标及组件定位，和灵活高效的分割查询机制以支持单目标与多目标场景。

Result: SegEarth-R2在LaSeRS和其它基准上取得优异表现，验证其在复杂语言指令下的分割能力，且代码与数据将公开以推动领域进步。

Conclusion: LaSeRS弥补了现有数据集过于简单的不足，提供了针对复杂地理空间分割的全面基准；SegEarth-R2通过空间注意力监督和高效分割查询机制，在LaSeRS及其它基准上表现出色，为语言指引的遥感分割提供了强有力的基线。

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

### [19] [A Contextual Analysis of Driver-Facing and Dual-View Video Inputs for Distraction Detection in Naturalistic Driving Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20025)
*Anthony Dontoh,Stephanie Ivey,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨在驾驶分心检测任务中加入道路视角（路面前视）是否能提升基于驾驶员视角的视频识别效果。使用同步的双摄像头真实驾驶数据，比较SlowFast-R50、X3D-M、SlowOnly-R50三种时空动作识别架构，在单视角（仅驾驶员）与堆叠双视角输入下的表现。结果显示：对不同架构效果差异显著——SlowOnly单路径模型在双视角下提升9.8%，而SlowFast双路径模型因表征冲突反而下降7.2%，说明简单地添加上下文并不总能带来好处，需专门设计融合机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分心驾驶检测多仅使用驾驶员视角，忽视路况等外部上下文可能对驾驶行为判断有帮助。本研究旨在验证加入路面前视是否能在真实驾驶条件下提升检测精度，以及不同模型对多视角输入的适应性。

Method: 使用同步双摄数据（驾驶员视角与路面前视），在相同数据与训练流程下对比三种时空动作识别模型：SlowFast-R50、X3D-M、SlowOnly-R50。对每种模型测试两类输入：仅驾驶员视角与堆叠双视角（将两个视角按通道堆叠作为单输入）。评估指标为分类准确率，分析不同架构在双视角输入下的性能变化并讨论表征冲突与融合问题。

Result: 在自然驾驶数据上，SlowOnly-R50在堆叠双视角下比单视角提升约9.8%；X3D-M有小幅改进（未给出精确数值）；而SlowFast-R50在双视角下精度下降约7.2%，表明架构差异导致多视角融合效果不一致。

Conclusion: 将路面前视作为额外上下文并非总能提高分心检测性能；效果高度依赖模型架构与融合策略。单路径模型能从额外视角获益，但双路径模型可能产生表征冲突导致性能下降；因此多视角融合需要专门的架构设计以避免干扰。

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN依赖单一静态图，无法建模患者特异性病理关系；需通过多图谱和语义解缠提升个体化建模与诊断鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 多维判别器从特征子空间挖掘图感知潜模式；2. 基于潜模式动态构建一组激活图（activation graphs）；3. 关系融合引擎对激活图进行加权聚合并上下文化以输出诊断结果。

Result: MAPI-GNN提出通过学习多维激活图谱替代单一静态图，以更好建模患者个体化病理关系。方法包括：1）多维判别器发现图感知模式；2）动态构建激活图栈；3）关系融合引擎聚合上下文化用于诊断。实验证明在两项任务、1300+样本上显著优于SOTA。

Conclusion: 通过语义解缠与多图激活-融合机制，MAPI-GNN有效替代单一静态图，使GNN在多模态医疗诊断中表现更稳健、准确。

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出H2em，在双层超曲面嵌入中利用双层蕴含损失和判别对齐损失以及超曲面跨模态注意，提高组合零样本学习在大规模层次结构下的泛化性与判别性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法多在欧氏空间中通过正则化建模层次，但欧氏空间体积增长为多项式，无法有效表示具有指数结构的真实语义层次，导致泛化能力受限，因此采用更适合树状/层次结构表示的双曲几何空间。

Method: 引入超曲率空间（双曲几何）来嵌入状态、对象与组合；设计Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss利用超曲面蕴含锥（entailment cones）保持语义层次与概念层次关系；设计Discriminative Alignment Loss并结合hard negative mining以增大语义相近组合之间的测地距离；提出Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention实现样本感知的跨模态信息融合。

Result: 在三个基准（未指明）上经过大量消融实验，H2em 在闭世界和开世界CZSL任务均取得新的SOTA，证明所提方法在保持层次结构与提升判别性的同时能避免层次塌缩问题。

Conclusion: H2em 在三个基准的数据集上显著优于现有方法，在闭世界与开世界设置均达到新的最优性能，证明超球面/超曲面几何更适合刻画CZSL中的层次结构，且通过两个专门设计的损失和跨模态注意机制能防止层次塌缩并提升细粒度区分能力。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

*Chang Sun,Dongliang Xie,Bo Qin,Hong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALLR-Pin: shared encoder + dual decoders (characters + Pinyin) + LLM post-processing using Pinyin and candidate texts + LLM fine-tuning on synthetic errors to correct homophones, boosting Mandarin VSR


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mandarin VSR challenged by viseme ambiguity and many homophones; need phonetic cues and linguistic context to resolve errors

Method: Two-stage VALLR-Pin with multi-task learning and LLM-based post-processing

Result: Improved Mandarin lip-reading by combining video encoder, dual decoders for characters and Pinyin, LLM-based ambiguity resolution, and LLM fine-tuning on synthetic noisy pairs

Conclusion: Synergizing visual, phonetic, and linguistic signals yields more accurate Mandarin lip-reading; LLM fine-tuning on model-specific errors further improves correction.

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是实现高质量、稳定且高效的唇动同步系统，避免GAN/扩散带来的训练复杂性和不确定性，同时实现实时性和可控性。

Method: 方法包括两阶段：1) 一个紧凑的一步潜在空间编辑器（Stage 1），以参考身份、带掩码目标帧和低维唇部姿态向量重建图像，训练仅使用重建损失，无GAN或扩散模型；通过自监督生成嘴部改变的伪真值用于微调，以在推理时去除显式掩码并让网络学会局部化唇部编辑；2) 一个音频到姿态的Transformer（Stage 2），使用流匹配（flow-matching）目标从语音预测唇部姿态向量。两阶段结合提供确定性重建与鲁棒音频控制。

Result: 系统在单GPU上实现>100 FPS的实时推理，视觉效果与更大型最先进模型相当；系统稳定、简单，能够在无显式掩码的情况下局部化并仅编辑嘴部区域。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种两阶段、无掩码的实时唇动同步系统FlashLips，成功将唇部控制与图像渲染解耦，达到了单GPU上>100 FPS的实时性能，并在视觉质量上接近或匹配更大规模的最先进模型。

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

Motivation: 真实世界的图像描述通常缺乏事件背景、时间信息、结果和不可见的命名实体，影响各领域的应用，需要通过外部文本知识增强视觉描述的上下文深度。

Method: 1) 使用BEIT-3和SigLIP对图库进行语义检索；2) 用ORB和SIFT进行几何重排行并重排检索结果；3) 对检索到的相关文章执行语义搜索以提取上下文信息；4) 用QLoRA微调的Qwen3将上下文与Instruct BLIP(Vicuna-7B)生成的基础描述融合生成最终描述。

Result: This paper presents a multimodal pipeline for enriching image captions with external textual knowledge to include event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了描述的上下文深度和信息量，适用于新闻、教育和数字档案等需要更深层视觉-文本理解的领域，但依赖检索库质量和外部文本准确性，且计算开销较高。

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

*Jinyoung Choi,Youngchae Kwon,Injung Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IRSN：基于商品区域的时尚风格分类网络，通过商品区域池化提取单件特征、门控融合并结合双主干（领域专用+大规模图文预训练通用）提升分类。对6个主干在两个数据集均显著提升（平均提升约7%），可视化显示对相似风格辨别更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚风格不仅体现在整体外观，还体现在单件服饰的属性及其组合，单纯全局表征难以区分同风格内大变形与不同风格的细微差别，因此需要基于商品区域的细粒度建模并利用外部通用特征提升泛化。

Method: 1）使用商品区域池化(IRP)基于预定义的商品区域裁剪并提取每件商品的特征；2）对各商品特征单独分析并用门控特征融合(GFF)将局部与全局信息融合；3）采用双主干结构：领域专用特征提取器 + 在大规模图文数据上预训练的通用特征提取器；4）将IRSN集成到多种主干（EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, Swin等）进行训练与评估。

Result: 在FashionStyle14上，6个主干平均提高6.9%，最高14.5%；在ShowniqV3上平均提高7.6%，最高15.1%。可视化分析表明IRSN更能聚焦区分性区域，从而改善相似风格的辨识。

Conclusion: IRSN通过显式建模商品级特征及其组合，并结合双主干架构，能显著提升时尚风格分类性能，特别是在区分视觉相似风格上更有效。

Abstract: Fashion style classification is a challenging task because of the large visual variation within the same style and the existence of visually similar styles.
  Styles are expressed not only by the global appearance, but also by the attributes of individual items and their combinations.
  In this study, we propose an item region-based fashion style classification network (IRSN) to effectively classify fashion styles by analyzing item-specific features and their combinations in addition to global features.
  IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF).
  In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset.
  In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset. Visualization analysis also supports that the IRSN models are better than the baseline models at capturing differences between similar style classes.

TL;DR: 该论文评估了激活函数和优化器组合对基于递归网络的人体动作识别(HAR)性能影响。使用ReLU/Sigmoid/Tanh与SGD/Adam/RMSprop/Adagrad，基于BiLSTM和ConvLSTM，在HMDB51和UCF101的6个医疗相关动作子集上进行实验。结果显示ConvLSTM优于BiLSTM，ConvLSTM+Adam/RMSprop达99%准确率；BiLSTM在UCF101接近98%，但在HMDB51降至约60%。结论指出AF与MO的选择对HAR系统性能有重要影响，建议在医疗场景优先使用ConvLSTM和Adam/RMSprop。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在HAR中广泛应用，但关于激活函数与优化器组合如何影响模型表现的系统性研究较少，尤其是在实际医疗场景中。作者希望通过实验明确这些低层设计选择对递归网络在HAR任务中的影响，从而为实际部署提供指导。

Method: 在HMDB51和UCF101中挑选6个医疗相关动作类别，构建BiLSTM和ConvLSTM模型；在每个模型中分别测试3种激活函数（ReLU、Sigmoid、Tanh）和4种优化器（SGD、Adam、RMSprop、Adagrad）的组合，记录各组合下的分类准确率并比较性能差异。

Result: 实验表明ConvLSTM在两个数据集上均优于BiLSTM；ConvLSTM+Adam/RMSprop可达最高99%准确率；BiLSTM在UCF101表现良好（接近98%），但在HMDB51仅约60%，显示对数据集鲁棒性较差。

Conclusion: ConvLSTM在所测设置下总体优于BiLSTM，尤以与Adam或RMSprop配合时表现最稳健；BiLSTM对数据集变化敏感，在较困难的HMDB51上性能显著下降。研究强调在医疗应用中优先采用ConvLSTM+Adam/RMSprop以获得高精度且稳定的动作识别。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a vital role in healthcare, surveillance, and innovative environments, where reliable action recognition supports timely decision-making and automation. Although deep learning-based HAR systems are widely adopted, the impact of Activation Functions (AFs) and Model Optimizers (MOs) on performance has not been sufficiently analyzed, particularly regarding how their combinations influence model behavior in practical scenarios. Most existing studies focus on architecture design, while the interaction between AF and MO choices remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we investigate the effect of three commonly used activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh) combined with four optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and Adagrad) using two recurrent deep learning architectures, namely BiLSTM and ConvLSTM. Experiments are conducted on six medically relevant activity classes selected from the HMDB51 and UCF101 datasets, considering their suitability for healthcare-oriented HAR applications. Our experimental results show that ConvLSTM consistently outperforms BiLSTM across both datasets. ConvLSTM, combined with Adam or RMSprop, achieves an accuracy of up to 99.00%, demonstrating strong spatio-temporal learning capabilities and stable performance. While BiLSTM performs reasonably well on UCF101, with accuracy approaching 98.00%, its performance drops to approximately 60.00% on HMDB51, indicating limited robustness across datasets and weaker sensitivity to AF and MO variations. This study provides practical insights for optimizing HAR systems, particularly for real-world healthcare environments where fast and precise activity detection is critical.

TL;DR: Use 3D layout as intermediate to convert diverse user inputs into semantic+depth signals, then rangemap ControlNet generates controllable realistic LiDAR point clouds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previous methods can't balance high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation and flexible control signals; simple controls mismatch complex LiDAR distributions.

Method: LiDARDraft: Layout-guided conditional generation

Result: Unified 3D layout representation from text/images/point clouds transformed into semantic and depth controls; rangemap-based ControlNet guides generation; enables simulation from scratch.

Conclusion: LiDARDraft bridges versatile conditional inputs and LiDAR point clouds via 3D layouts and rangemap-based ControlNet, enabling high-quality, controllable LiDAR simulation from text/images/sketches.

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么确定性网络渲染速度快但对未见区域模糊，要么扩散模型能生成合理细节但训练/推理开销大。目标是融合两者优点，在保证真实感与3D一致性的同时显著降低计算开销。

Method: 方法包括：1) 使用双向Transformer融合多视图图像token和Plücker射线嵌入形成共享潜在表示；2) 设计两个轻量级头部：一个前馈回归头用于渲染几何约束充分的像素，另一个带掩码的自回归扩散头用于完成遮挡或未见区域；3) 端到端联合优化，损失由光度损失与扩散损失组成；4) 不依赖手工3D归纳偏置，易于扩展到多场景。

Result: 实验显示该方法在图像质量上达到或优于现有最先进方法，同时相较于完全生成的扩散基线在渲染时间上提升约一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种结合确定性渲染和随机扩散生成的混合框架，通过双向Transformer编码多视图图像token和Plücker射线嵌入，得到共享潜在表征，并用两个轻量头分别处理受约束的像素回归与遮挡/未见区域的扩增式生成，实现端到端训练，兼顾质量与速度。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) seeks to render photorealistic, 3D-consistent images of a scene from unseen camera poses given only a sparse set of posed views. Existing deterministic networks render observed regions quickly but blur unobserved areas, whereas stochastic diffusion-based methods hallucinate plausible content yet incur heavy training- and inference-time costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms. A bidirectional transformer encodes multi-view image tokens and Plucker-ray embeddings, producing a shared latent representation. Two lightweight heads then act on this representation: (i) a feed-forward regression head that renders pixels where geometry is well constrained, and (ii) a masked autoregressive diffusion head that completes occluded or unseen regions. The entire model is trained end-to-end with joint photometric and diffusion losses, without handcrafted 3D inductive biases, enabling scalability across diverse scenes. Experiments demonstrate that our method attains state-of-the-art image quality while reducing rendering time by an order of magnitude compared with fully generative baselines.

Motivation: Bridge deck delamination is hard to detect manually; single sensors have limitations; multimodal fusion may overcome them.

Method: 网络包含雷达时序注意力、热像空间注意力、可学习嵌入的跨模态融合、Monte Carlo dropout和方差学习以分解不确定性，多头注意力与消融研究验证设计。

Result: A multimodal attention network fusing radar temporal and thermal spatial features improves delamination detection, with uncertainty quantification; outperforms baselines on several datasets; attention vulnerable under extreme class imbalance.

Conclusion: 多模态交叉注意力结合不确定性估计在常见数据分布下能有效检测桥面空洞；但在极端类不平衡下需额外策略。

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Result: 在AVS-Objects和VPO基准上，DDAVS在单源、多源和多实例场景均优于现有方法，表现稳定且具泛化能力。

Conclusion: DDAVS通过音频语义解缠和延迟双向对齐，有效缓解了多源纠缠和视听错位问题，从而提升AVS性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有剪枝方法只考虑token或head之一且多依赖启发式或一阶信息，导致精度下降或泛化性差的问题，目标是在资源受限设备上实现高效且精度可控的ViT推理。

Method: 使用高效的Hessian-vector products估计对每个token和attention head的曲率加权敏感度，基于显式损失预算进行动态输入自适应剪枝，随后对模型进行微调以恢复精度。

Result: HEART-ViT提出了一个统一的二阶动态注意力与token剪枝框架，通过高效Hessian向量积估计token和head的曲率加权敏感度，在显式损失预算下做出剪枝决策。实验在ImageNet-100/1K和多种设备上显示显著的FLOPs、延迟和吞吐量改善，同时保持或提升精度。

Conclusion: 二阶曲率加权敏感度可用于统一评估token和head的重要性；token剪枝带来主要计算节省，head剪枝用于细化冗余，两者结合在保持精度下实现最佳效率；方法在多个数据集与边缘设备上均有实证。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

TL;DR: Radar HPE method that fuses cross-view spatio-temporal features with attention decoder and velocity loss to handle sparse reflections


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sparse radar signals for HPE by modeling spatio-temporal dependencies to infer missing joints

Method: Analyze method and contributions

Result: Significant AP improvements on TransHuPR and HuPR, with reasonable complexity

Conclusion: milliMamba effectively leverages temporal and spatial cues to recover missing joints and improves accuracy versus baselines

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Use 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct orchard scenes, annotate sparsely in 3D, project to images to create large labelled sets; yields massive annotation reduction and strong position results but poor orientation learning under heavy occlusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce manual annotation effort for apple pose estimation in orchards with occlusions by leveraging 3D reconstruction to project simplified annotations to many images.

Method: 3D Gaussian Splatting-based annotation pipeline and pose estimation training

Result: Pipeline reduced manual annotations from many to 105 and generated 28,191 training labels (99.6% reduction). Best performance when training on fruits ≤95% occluded: neutral F1 0.927 (original) and 0.970 (rendered). Dataset size had small effect; least occluded fruits had best position estimates; orientation estimation failed.

Conclusion: 3D reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting effectively amplifies annotations and improves pose estimation dataset creation, significantly lowering manual effort. Position estimates robust for less occluded fruits; orientation remains challenging and more work needed for occluded orientation estimation.

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-shot object counting aims to estimate object counts for novel classes with few or no exemplars; challenge is dense regions with small objects where density methods count well but localize poorly, and point-detection methods localize but fail at very large counts due to limited queries.

CoDi significantly improves MAE on FSC benchmark (15% few-shot, 13% one-shot, 10% reference-less) and on MCAC (44% MAE improvement). Code released.

Conclusion: CoDi successfully combines density estimation与定位能力，通过示例式条件模块在潜在扩散框架中实现，对低样本计数任务效果显著提升，设置新基准。

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

Result: Dataset NL-DIR created; evaluations show existing models struggle; two-stage method improves performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: NL-DIR fills gap, challenging for current models, enables future VDU research; dataset released on Hugging Face.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community. Datasets and codes will be publicly available at huggingface.co/datasets/nianbing/NL-DIR.

*Zhaoyang Jia,Jiahao Li,Bin Li,Houqiang Li,Yan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Generative Latent Coding (GLC)，在VQ-VAE的生成潜空间做量化编码并引入分类超模块和码预测监督，在极低码率下实现高真实感与高保真度，并能用于修复与风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素空间的失真度量与人类感知不一致，导致在低码率下难以兼顾真实感与保真度；生成潜空间更稀疏并与语义对齐，适合低码率高质量压缩。

Method: 使用VQ-VAE构建生成潜空间，在该潜空间对潜码（code）进行变换编码；设计分类超模块压缩超信息；引入基于码预测的监督来强化语义一致性；训练并在自然图像与人脸数据上评估，比较FID与比特率。

Result: GLC在生成潜空间进行变换编码，通过VQ-VAE的语义化稀疏表示在极低码率下兼顾真实感与保真度；提出分类超模块降超信息比特开销与基于码预测的监督增强语义一致性；在自然图像和人脸图像上分别在<0.04 bpp和<0.01 bpp下保持高视觉质量；在CLIC2020上比MS-ILLM节省45%比特但保持相同FID；并支持图像修复与风格迁移等下游应用。

Conclusion: 在生成潜空间编码比像素空间更有利于在超低码率下实现高视觉质量；分类超模块与码预测监督有效降低比特并提升语义一致性；GLC在多个基准上展现出比特率与FID的显著优势。

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer. The code is available at https://github.com/jzyustc/GLC.

TL;DR: JDPNet mines and unifies coupled underwater degradations via joint feature-mining and probabilistic bootstrap distribution, guided by AquaBalanceLoss, yielding SOTA results with efficient model size


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer nonlinear coupled degradations; existing methods treat degradations separately and miss coupling information

Method: JDPNet: joint degradation processing network

Result: Proposed joint feature-mining module, probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, and AquaBalanceLoss; achieves SOTA on six public datasets and two new datasets with good tradeoff of performance, parameters, and cost

Conclusion: JDPNet effectively captures nonlinear interactions among multiple underwater degradations in a unified framework, improving recovery quality while maintaining efficiency

Abstract: Given the complexity of underwater environments and the variability of water as a medium, underwater images are inevitably subject to various types of degradation. The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

### [40] [LiteFusion: Taming 3D Object Detectors from Vision-Based to Multi-Modal with Minimal Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20217)
*Xiangxuan Ren,Zhongdao Wang,Pin Tang,Guoqing Wang,Jilai Zheng,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LiteFusion：在四元数空间将LiDAR点作为几何补充融入图像特征，去除3D骨干，提升检测精度且便于部署，且在无LiDAR时仍鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态3D检测器对LiDAR过度依赖并采用复杂的3D骨干，导致在无LiDAR情形下性能崩溃且难以在非GPU硬件（如NPU、FPGA）上部署。需要一种轻量且对LiDAR缺失更鲁棒、易部署的融合方法。

Method: 不使用独立的LiDAR特征提取骨干，LiteFusion将LiDAR点的互补特征注入到图像特征中，采用四元数空间融合以保持模态间正交约束并学习紧凑的跨模态嵌入，从而避免3D稀疏卷积并减小参数增长（约1.1%）。

Result: 在nuScenes上，相比基线视觉检测器，LiteFusion分别提升了+20.4% mAP和+19.7% NDS；参数仅增加约1.1%；即使无LiDAR输入，仍保持较强性能，展示出良好鲁棒性和部署友好性。

Conclusion: LiteFusion通过将LiDAR作为辅助几何信息融入图像特征（在四元数空间中保持正交约束）而非独立3D骨干，实现了无需3D稀疏卷积器的高效多模态3D检测方案，在nuScenes上显著提升了基于视觉的检测性能，并在缺失LiDAR时仍保持鲁棒性，便于在多种硬件平台上部署。

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 构建了面向印度语的多语种大规模文档布局数据集IndicDLP并提供预训练集UED-mini；在多语言与领域上均优于现有数据，能显著提升英文模型在印度语布局上的表现并具有良好泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模数据集缺乏细粒度标注与多语种（尤其是Indic语言）覆盖，人工注释数据集虽细致但规模小且多语种不足，导致对Indic文档布局理解的进展受限。

Method: 收集并标注涵盖11种Indic语言与英语的文档，覆盖12个常见领域；从DocLayNet和M6Doc构建UED-mini用于预训练；对已有英文布局模型进行在IndicDLP上的微调并评估泛化能力。

Result: IndicDLP: 一个覆盖11种印度语言及英语的大规模文档布局数据集，包含12个领域，弥合现有数据集在规模、多样性和细粒度标注方面的不足；UED-mini: 从DocLayNet与M6Doc构建的微型数据集，用于预训练提升模型基础能力。

Conclusion: IndicDLP在规模、语言覆盖（11种Indic语言+英语）、领域多样性和标注细粒度上填补了现有数据集的空白，能有效提升模型在印度语及其他语言文档布局理解上的性能。

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一HSI恢复依赖难以获取的预定义退化标签，难以应对复杂混合或未见退化；需要一种无需显式先验即可适配多种退化的方法。

Method: 设计了连续的空间-光谱退化度量作为退化提示（DP），并提出空间-光谱自适应模块（SSAM）以可学习参数调制特征提取；将SSAM作为Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）中的专家、以DP作为路由器，实现动态专家选择与特征融合。

Result: 在自然与遥感HSI数据集上实验表明DAMP在多种退化下达到SOTA性能，并具备对混合/未见退化的优秀泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的DAMP框架通过不依赖预定义退化先验，而是以空间-光谱退化度量作为提示，实现了统一HSI恢复任务下的自适应、多任务泛化。

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感影像中存在高类间相似性与大类内变异，导致像素级学习难以获得足够判别性的语义信息。现有方法难以有效将抽象而判别性的类级语义知识注入像素特征，造成边界模糊与类别混淆，因此需要一种可解释且能增强类别嵌入判别性的双向协同机制。

Method: 构建Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS)：由类别嵌入生成类级热力图，并在特征图与类嵌入间建立双向信息流；设计层级监督，使用每个HBIS生成的热力图作为低分辨率分割预测用于监督；提出跨层类嵌入费舍尔判别损失以在嵌入空间中约束类内紧凑、类间可分离。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

TL;DR: LADLE-MM通过混合分支与BLIP参考嵌入，在有限标注与低资源下以更少参数实现强劲的多模态错误信息检测性能与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着易用的多媒体生成工具普及，跨模态合成篡改成为传播错误信息的主要手段，而现有检测器通常依赖复杂架构或大量标注，迫切需要在有限标注和资源受限条件下仍能有效运行的检测方法。

Method: 提出了LADLE-MM：由两个单模态分支和一个多模态分支组成，利用BLIP提取额外的多模态嵌入作为固定参考空间，采用model-soup初始化和学习型集成策略以在有限标注设置和受限计算下训练。

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

Conclusion: D^3ETOR通过增强伪标签质量和逐步去偏的频域特征融合，有效利用伪掩码与涂写标注的互补信息，显著提升WSCOD性能，达到或接近全监督水平。

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: This paper introduces a method to quantify instability in SHAP explanations for medical images by combining Dirichlet sampling with Dempster-Shafer theory, producing uncertainty maps and statistical measures, validated on pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning models for medical imaging are increasingly complex, reducing interpretability; SHAP offers explanations but is unstable under uncertainties. The paper aims to quantify uncertainty in SHAP explanations using probabilistic methods.

Method: Use Dirichlet posterior sampling to generate multiple SHAP maps, convert samples into belief and plausibility via Dempster-Shafer theory, fuse evidence to create uncertainty-aware explanation maps, and perform statistical analyses across three datasets with varying class distributions and image qualities.

Result: Proposed a framework combining Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to produce belief, plausible, and fusion maps and statistical analysis to quantify SHAP uncertainty; evaluated on three diverse medical imaging datasets showing applicability across modalities.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides meaningful quantification of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in SHAP explanations, yielding more reliable interpretability for medical imaging models across varied datasets; it highlights areas where explanations are unreliable and supports safer model deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

Motivation: 现有DiT-based VVT方法难以捕捉细粒度服装动态并保持背景一致性，且常引入额外交互模块导致计算开销大，同时缺乏大规模高质量数据阻碍泛化与训练效果。因此利用关键帧中的前景动态与背景一致性，进行有针对性的细节注入以提升效果并降低复杂度。

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

Motivation: motivation of this work

Result: result summary

Conclusion: conclusion of the paper

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

TL;DR: Proposes SmartSplat: adaptive, feature-aware Gaussian-splatting-based image compression using gradient-color guided variational sampling, exclusion-based uniform sampling, and scale-adaptive color initialization to achieve high-quality compression for ultra-high-res images


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address compression and decoding challenges for ultra-high-resolution generative AI images by improving 2D Gaussian Representations for efficiency and fidelity

Method: Analysis of methods and contributions

Result: SmartSplat outperforms SOTA on DIV8K and 16K dataset, better scalability and higher quality at strong compression

Conclusion: SmartSplat effectively balances compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity via joint optimization of Gaussian parameters, offering strong scalability and practical applicability

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat.

TL;DR: DETACH decomposes spatio-temporal features and uses sensor-driven spatial semantics plus weighted contrastive loss to better align exocentric video with ambient sensors, outperforming baselines


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior egocentric-wearable global alignment fails for exocentric-ambient due to lost local details and over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns; need non-intrusive scalable alternative leveraging ambient sensors with semantic grounding

Method: Decomposed spatio-temporal alignment for exocentric-ambient data

Result: Proposed DETACH: decomposed spatial and temporal features, online clustering to get sensor-spatial features, two-stage alignment (mutual supervision for spatial correspondence, spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss for temporal alignment); shows substantial improvements on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets

Conclusion: Explicit decomposition and sensor-spatial semantic grounding effectively address local detail capture and context-aware alignment, leading to superior performance on benchmark datasets

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

TL;DR: Introduce inductive criminal bias into LLM reasoning for surveillance via multi-agent CoAT with final anomaly-focused classifier; yields substantial F1 gains in detection and classification


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large Vision-Language Models are biased towards normal events, leading to failures in detecting crimes in surveillance video; Chain-of-Thought lacks inductive anomaly bias and thus reinforces normal interpretations

Method: Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT)

Result: CoAT is a multi-agent reasoning framework adding an anomaly-focused classification layer, improving Anomaly Detection F1 by 11.8 percentage points on low-res footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. on high-res videos

Conclusion: Embedding anomaly-focused inductive bias into multi-agent reasoning mitigates normality bias of VLMs and significantly enhances crime detection and classification performance

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

Result: The paper proposes TBSD, a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition method for anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies.

Experiments show it outperforms benchmarks with fewer misidentifications, smaller training data needs, and better detection on simulations and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: TBSD通过纹理基学习和基于先验的异常检测，有效区分纹理与异常，在少样本情形下仍能保持高检测性能，优于现有基准方法。

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉的人体动作理解方法忽略了生物力学中的物理线索（关节驱动力），而这些力学信息可能有助于在动态、遮挡或外观变化情况下提升理解效果。研究动机是探究在何时、何种条件下物理推断的力信息能增强动作理解。

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用地雷与周围土壤在LWIR波段的热对比，增强特征提取以提高UAS对表面地雷的自动检测率，从而缓解地雷对平民的长期威胁。

Method: 在UAS采集的114张测试图像上，对不同高度（5–10m）和不同热融合比（0–100%）进行组合实验，使用YOLOv8/10/11以及RF-DETR、Faster R-CNN、RetinaNet等多种检测器训练与评估，总计35,640次模型-条件评估；同时比较多时相与季节性数据集对性能的影响。

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.
  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.
  Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy.
  Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于单目视频的动态图重建在快速运动、多物体交互和遮挡场景下难以保持运动保真和时空一致性，需一种能同时捕捉高频几何细节且遵循物理一致性的损失与表示。

Method: 使用SIREN网络作为隐式场景表示的激活函数，设计几何感知损失包括关键点一致性、物理启发的约束（如运动平滑与可达域）、以及时间一致性项；扩充并使用标注的UniKPT数据训练关键点检测与GNN关系模块，联合优化隐式场景网络与关键点预测网络。

Result: SirenPose is a geometry-aware loss that combines SIREN periodic activations with keypoint geometric supervision, physics-inspired spatiotemporal constraints, high-frequency signal modeling, expanded UniKPT dataset, and GNNs for keypoint relations; shows strong improvements on multiple benchmarks and pose metrics compared to SOTA.

Conclusion: SirenPose在处理快速运动、多物体交互、遮挡和快速场景变化时，比现有方法（如MoSCA和Monst3R）表现更好，提升了图像质量、时序一致性和位姿准确性，证明了几何感知损失与高频表示的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, SirenPose outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error as well as reduced translational and rotational relative pose error, highlighting its effectiveness in handling rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction.

Abstract: Single-view RGB model-based object pose estimation methods achieve strong generalization but are fundamentally limited by depth ambiguity, clutter, and occlusions. Multi-view pose estimation methods have the potential to solve these issues, but existing works rely on precise single-view pose estimates or lack generalization to unseen objects. We address these challenges via the following three contributions. First, we introduce AlignPose, a 6D object pose estimation method that aggregates information from multiple extrinsically calibrated RGB views and does not require any object-specific training or symmetry annotation. Second, the key component of this approach is a new multi-view feature-metric refinement specifically designed for object pose. It optimizes a single, consistent world-frame object pose minimizing the feature discrepancy between on-the-fly rendered object features and observed image features across all views simultaneously. Third, we report extensive experiments on four datasets (YCB-V, T-LESS, ITODD-MV, HouseCat6D) using the BOP benchmark evaluation and show that AlignPose outperforms other published methods, especially on challenging industrial datasets where multiple views are readily available in practice.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多曝光与多焦点融合中输入图像在动态范围与焦深上的差异，以及现有将文本作为辅助指导时对细粒度信息和精确跨模态对齐的处理不足。

Method: 1) 生成多粒度文本描述（细节、结构、语义）；2) 设计层级跨模态调制模块将不同粒度文本信息注入视觉特征；3) 在每一粒度施加对齐监督信号；4) 采用显著性驱动的语义增强模块扩充训练数据语义密度；5) 在多曝光与多焦点数据集上训练与评估。

Conclusion: 多粒度文本指导配合多层监督和语义增强，可有效增强跨模态对齐与融合性能，MTIF在多种图像融合任务上表现优越。

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

TL;DR: 自动化从野外视频生成4D感知多选QA，构建训练集与人校准测试集；提出GSM模块把3D/运动先验提取为紧凑几何tokens，提升VLM在动态空间推理上的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM在动态空间推理（物体随时间的几何与关系变化）上薄弱，原因是缺乏大规模4D感知训练资源；为此需要同时在数据集、评测基准与模型设计上弥补空白。

Method: 1) 自动化管线利用预训练视觉基座模型从视频提取相机位姿、局部点云、物体mask、朝向与3D轨迹，生成多选QA；2) 构建DSR-Train（自动）与DSR-Bench（人类精校）；3) 提出Geometry Selection Module：根据问题语义从预训练4D重建先验中选择相关几何信息并编码为几何tokens，与VLM融合；4) 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上训练并评估。

Result: DSR Suite introduces dataset, benchmark, and model module for dynamic spatial reasoning.

Conclusion: DSR Suite通过可扩展数据流水线与轻量的几何选择模块，有效提升VLM对物体随时间变化的3D空间关系推理，同时不损害常规视频理解性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) excel at general understanding yet remain weak at dynamic spatial reasoning (DSR), i.e., reasoning about the evolvement of object geometry and relationship in 3D space over time, largely due to the scarcity of scalable 4D-aware training resources. To bridge this gap across aspects of dataset, benchmark and model, we introduce DSR Suite. First, we propose an automated pipeline that generates multiple-choice question-answer pairs from in-the-wild videos for DSR. By leveraging modern vision foundation models, the pipeline extracts rich geometric and motion information, including camera poses, local point clouds, object masks, orientations, and 3D trajectories. These geometric cues enable the construction of DSR-Train for learning and further human-refined DSR-Bench for evaluation. Compared with previous works, our data emphasize (i) in-the-wild video sources, (ii) object- and scene-level 3D requirements, (iii) viewpoint transformations, (iv) multi-object interactions, and (v) fine-grained, procedural answers. Beyond data, we propose a lightweight Geometry Selection Module (GSM) to seamlessly integrate geometric priors into VLMs, which condenses question semantics and extracts question-relevant knowledge from pretrained 4D reconstruction priors into a compact set of geometry tokens. This targeted extraction avoids overwhelming the model with irrelevant knowledge. Experiments show that integrating DSR-Train and GSM into Qwen2.5-VL-7B significantly enhances its dynamic spatial reasoning capability, while maintaining accuracy on general video understanding benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FlashVLM，一种基于文本引导的视觉token选择框架，通过在语言模型空间计算图像token与文本嵌入的显式相似度，并与视觉内在显著性结合，实现动态、可控且保持多样性的token剪枝。实验证明在相同token预算下能超过无剪枝基线，在大幅压缩视觉token的同时保持高性能与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是VLM处理大量视觉token导致二次注意力开销高且冗余；现有token压缩方法忽视文本查询或依赖脆弱的深层注意力图，在激进剪枝下会破坏语义对齐，需一种基于文本且稳健的选择机制。

Method: 方法包括：1) 将图像token投影到语言模型的空间，计算与归一化文本嵌入的显式交叉模态相似度作为外在相关性；2) 将该外在相关性与图像自身的显著性通过对数域加权与温度调节的锐化融合；3) 使用保持多样性的分区策略保留少量代表性背景token以维护全局上下文；4) 在相同token预算和评估协议下与基线比较。

Result: 在14个图像和视频基准上，FlashVLM实现了领先的效率与性能折中，保持强鲁棒性与泛化能力；在LLaVA 1.5上剪枝77.8%时优于无剪枝基线，94.4%压缩下仍达92.8%准确率。

Conclusion: FlashVLM在多项图像和视频基准上展示了领先的效率-性能折中：在LLaVA 1.5上可在剪枝77.8%时超过无剪枝基线，并在94.4%压缩下保持92.8%的准确率，证明了文本引导选择、对数加权与多样性保持对保持语义对齐和全局上下文的重要性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

TL;DR: Misalignment between privileged expert data and sensor-based student observations (visibility, uncertainty, intent) harms imitation; closing these gaps and adding practical fixes yields major improvements (TFv6) on CARLA and real-world benchmarks


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate how differences in visibility, uncertainty, and under-specified navigational intent between privileged expert demonstrations and student observations limit imitation learning performance in simulation

Method: Empirical study of misalignment between privileged experts and sensor-based students in driving simulators

Result: After narrowing expert-student gaps and applying interventions, TransFuser v6 (TFv6) achieves state-of-the-art on CARLA closed-loop benchmarks (95 DS on Bench2Drive, >2x improvement on Longest6 v2 and Town13); also shows gains on NAVSIM and Waymo vision-based benchmarks when integrating perception supervision

Conclusion: Careful modifications to align expert demonstrations with student sensors and to better specify navigational intent significantly improve closed-loop driving performance; the provided code, data, and models support reproducibility

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.

TL;DR: Use pre-trained video Diffusion Transformers with attention matching and lightweight adaptation for strong point tracking performance


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing point tracking uses shallow CNNs processing frames independently -> lacks temporal coherence; video DiTs pre-trained with spatio-temporal attention may be better

Method: Query-key attention matching, LoRA tuning, cost fusion with ResNet

Result: DiTracker achieves SOTA on ITTO and matches/outperforms SOTA on TAP-Vid despite smaller batch size

Conclusion: Video DiT features are effective and efficient foundation for point tracking

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FedPIDAvg中因基于泊松异常值排除参与者导致的数据浪费，以及PID控制器对持续参与者和前轮信息依赖的局限，同时兼顾通信成本与训练效率。

Method: 提出基于轮次任务的FedPOD框架：用比例性调度（Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative）替代PID依赖，包含原先被排除的泊松异常参与者，采用每轮独立的验证损失计算以避免对上一轮信息的依赖，并将任务扩展为可按Kubernetes POD进行scale-out的单元。

Result: 在挑战赛中，FedPOD在Dice分数上与FedPIDAvg表现相近：WT 0.78、ET 0.71、TC 0.72（平均），投影收敛评分平均0.74，并展示了可与Kubernetes自动伸缩结合的灵活性。

Conclusion: FedPOD通过纳入先前被视为泊松分布异常值的参与者、消除对前一轮学习信息的依赖，并在每轮计算验证损失，从而在联邦学习中提高了训练效率与通信效率，同时保留数据利用率。

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

Conclusion: 验证了IWM设计思想能将视频虚拟人从被动动画升级为能在不确定生成环境中自主完成多步目标的智能体，ORCA优于无反思或开环基线。

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

Result: 评估发现：L1技能相对独立；高层技能高度相关且互依；监督微调显示L1内部存在负迁移，而低层向高层有强烈正迁移并具协同效应；天真RL让推理能力提高但直觉感知下降，auto-think能抑制不必要思考，使RL在所有层面稳定改进。

Conclusion: 本文提出了SpatialTree层次化框架，证明了在多模态大模型中空间能力呈现从感知到推理再到交互的分层结构，并展示了通过自动思考限制的强化学习可以同时提升各层能力。

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

Conclusion: 在语义空间先进行全局规划，然后再生成细节的两阶段扩散流水线，可显著提高训练与生成效率，尤其适合长视频生成，且生成质量领先现有方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

Result: GACE: hybrid architecture using GPU to perform selective, high-speed measurement when Risky Gate detects uncertainty; reduces P99 tail latency and improves plan stability while keeping low overhead in stable regions by accounting measurement cost.

Conclusion: GACE能在问题区间显著提升基数估计准确性和计划稳定性，且通过风险门控与显式测量成本核算将加速测量开销控制在可接受范围。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a cornerstone of cost-based optimizers (CBOs), yet real-world workloads often violate the assumptions behind static statistics, degrading decision stability and increasing plan flip rates. We empirically characterize failures caused by stale statistics, skew, join correlations, hidden distributions in bind variables, and sampling bias, and quantify the overhead and break-even points of hardware-accelerated measurement.
  We propose GACE (GPU-Assisted Cardinality Estimation), a hybrid auxiliary architecture that augments rather than replaces the optimizer. GACE selectively invokes GPU-based measurement only in risky intervals via a Risky Gate that detects estimation uncertainty, and a GPU Measurement Engine that performs high-speed probing with explicit cost accounting for the measurement itself. This design preserves low overhead in stable regions while improving plan stability and reducing tail latency (P99) in problematic scenarios.
