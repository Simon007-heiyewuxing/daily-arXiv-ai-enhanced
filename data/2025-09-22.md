### [1] [Exploring the Capabilities of LLM Encoders for Image-Text Retrieval in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15234)
*Hanbin Ko,Gihun Cho,Inhyeok Baek,Donguk Kim,Joonbeom Koo,Changi Kim,Dongheon Lee,Chang Min Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 针对胸片报告异质性问题，作者用领域适配的大语言模型构建文本编码器并与视觉模型对齐，在含噪1.6M研究上训练，达成比BERT和已有医学CLIP更好的临床对齐和跨域泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像报告具有缩写、仅有结论、风格不一致等异质性，直接扩大含噪数据规模可能导致性能饱和或下降，作者希望通过更鲁棒的文本表示（大语言模型编码器）提升影像—文本对齐的泛化性与临床相关性。

Method: 作者构建并领域微调一个面向胸片报告的大型语言模型编码器（LLM2VEC4CXR），处理缩略词和风格变异；在此基础上设计双塔框架LLM2CLIP4CXR，将文本编码器与视觉编码器对齐，采用对比学习在1.6M胸片研究（公私混合、报告噪声大）上训练。

Result: LLM2VEC4CXR在临床文本理解任务上优于BERT基线，能更好处理缩写与风格差异；LLM2CLIP4CXR在检索准确率和临床评价指标上带来提升，并在跨数据集测试中表现更稳定。整体显示鲁棒性胜过单纯扩大量级数据。

Conclusion: 该论文表明在胸部X光影像-文本预训练中，使用领域自适应的大语言模型编码器（LLM2VEC4CXR）能显著提升临床文本表征的鲁棒性，从而在跨风格、含噪报告的场景下优于BERT基线；进一步将该编码器与视觉主干结合（LLM2CLIP4CXR）可提高检索和临床导向评估的性能，并在跨数据集泛化上超过先前医学CLIP变体。

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress
in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports,
including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability.
Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better
performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau
or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM)
encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across
diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR,
a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a
dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone.
LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines,
handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical
alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to
boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger
cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M
CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy
reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the
key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further
research in medical image-text representation learning.

### [2] [ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235)
*Jialiang Kang,Han Shu,Wenshuo Li,Yingjie Zhai,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ViSpec：在草稿模型中加入轻量视觉适配器和全局图像特征，显著提升VLM的speculative decoding速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在speculative decoding上加速有限，作者假设大模型能逐层过滤图像冗余信息，而小草稿模型难以胜任，因而设计视觉感知机制让草稿模型获得压缩图像信息以提高推理效率。

Method: 在目标VLM上训练一个轻量视觉适配器将图像token压缩为紧凑表示，保留位置信息并注入草稿模型的attention；同时提取全局图像向量并拼接到后续文本token。为训练构建专门的数据集，包括利用目标VLM生成的长回应，并采取策略避免草稿模型直接利用目标模型隐藏态导致捷径学习。

Result: ViSpec在VLM上实现了有意义的加速，通过视觉适配器压缩图像信息并引入全局图像特征来增强草稿模型的多模态理解，同时设计了专门的数据集与训练策略避免捷径学习。

Conclusion: ViSpec通过视觉适配器和全局向量显著提高了VLM推理加速，是VLM领域首个实现较大加速的speculative decoding方法，且训练策略降低了捷径学习风险。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models
(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest
speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal
capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large
VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without
compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do
so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a
novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor
module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is
seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while
preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a
global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text
tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the
scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a
specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating
extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training
strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the
target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning
when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate
ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM
speculative decoding.

### [3] [M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241)
*Shreyash Verma,Amit Kesari,Vinayak Trivedi,Anupam Purwar,Ratnesh Jamidar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PACE 利用母子 MLLM 在一次多模态推理中完成广告合规评估，构建增强标注基准并通过模型选择在准确性和成本间取得显著平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合规检测由多个独立模块组成，运维复杂、难以扩展且对动态规则适应性差；MLLM 的出现提供了将流程统一的可能。

Method: 提出 M-PACE 框架，使用母子 MLLM（强母模型评估小子模型输出）在单次处理视觉-文本输入中评估多达 15 个合规属性；构建人类标注与增强数据集用于评测并模拟现实干扰；通过成本-质量平衡选择最佳子模型。

Result: 在广告合规任务上，M-PACE 可减少超过 31 倍的推理成本（如使用 Gemini 2.0 Flash 子模型每图成本 0.0005，相比 Gemini 2.5 Pro 每图 0.0159），同时在准确性上可与更昂贵模型相当，降低人工审核依赖。

Conclusion: M-PACE 能有效将多模态合规检测工作流统一到单一框架，通过母子 MLLM 结构在保持准确性的同时显著降低推理成本，适合广告合规模型部署。

Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or
platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge
across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed,
multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification,
text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based
merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead,
hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines
efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single,
general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual
content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance
Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across
vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply
M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over
15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we
introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that
simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and
profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating
that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can
significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality
control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times,
with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by
mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5
Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and
output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over
advertising data.

### [4] [ProFusion: 3D Reconstruction of Protein Complex Structures from Multi-view AFM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15242)
*Jaydeep Rade,Md Hasibul Hasan Hasib,Meric Ozturk,Baboucarr Faal,Sheng Yang,Dipali G. Sashital,Vincenzo Venditti,Baoyu Chen,Soumik Sarkar,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Anwesha Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProFusion结合虚拟AFM生成的大规模多视角数据及条件扩散+实例化NeRF，实现对多蛋白复合体的高保真3D重建，结果与AFM分辨率一致并经实验验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有AI蛋白质结构预测在大型多蛋白复合体上的局限，通过结合AFM的高清高度图提供的多视角3D线索，提高大复杂体的结构重构精度。

Method: 构建虚拟AFM成像流程合成大规模训练集；训练条件扩散模型从单一或有限视角合成额外视图；对目标实例使用NeRF基于多视图重建点云/表面，评估使用Chamfer距离与AFM分辨率比较。

Result: 提出ProFusion框架：虚拟AFM数据集(~542,000蛋白，多视角合成AFM图像)、条件扩散模型生成新视角、实例化NeRF用于3D重建；重建结果在Chamfer距离上接近AFM分辨率，并在实验AFM图像上得到验证。

Conclusion: ProFusion能以低成本快速提供对复杂蛋白质复合体的可靠3D结构重建，适用于快速迭代验证和补充实验Cryo-EM等方法。

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but
often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple
interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques
like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion,
a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random
orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction.
However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep
learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework
that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins
with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to
synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D
protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging
resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively
validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong
potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and
rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

### [5] [Multi-Modal Interpretability for Enhanced Localization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15243)
*Muhammad Imran,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEL通过多尺度语义关系模块和梯度归因融合，提升视觉-语言模型的可解释性，使解释更聚焦且具上下文感知，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在安全关键场景应用受限，原因在于对象间复杂关系、微妙视觉线索以及对透明性和可靠性的高要求，因而需要更具上下文感知的可解释方法。

Method: 基于Grad-eclip的梯度归因方法，MMEL引入层次语义关系模块：多尺度特征提取、可学习的层级权重以及跨模态对齐机制，将这些语义关系信息并入梯度归因图中以提升解释质量。

Result: 在标准数据集上的大量实验表明，MMEL在可视解释的聚焦性和上下文相关性方面优于纯梯度基方法，能更好地突显主要对象及其语境关系，并在多个领域展示良好泛化性。

Conclusion: MMEL提出了一种在保留性能的同时提升视觉-语言模型可解释性的框架，通过多尺度语义关系建模和梯度归因结合，生成更聚焦且具上下文感知的可视化解释。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the
frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in
safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships
between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency
and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning
(MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language
models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in
gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL
introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances
model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive
attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features
at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at
different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance
contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive
visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual
relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on
standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship
information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused
and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language
models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various
domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications
requiring high interpretability and reliability.

### [6] [Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250)
*Wenda Qin,Andrea Burns,Bryan A. Plummer,Margrit Betke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP)，基于导航信息先对token做前景/背景预过滤，再对背景进行剪枝，防止信息丢失导致路径变长，实验证明在VLN任务中能在节省>50% FLOPS的同时保持更高成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有token剪枝在VLN中会导致关键信息丢失进而增加路径长度与计算成本，需借助导航特性识别不重要的token以实现真正的效率提升。

Method: 1) 根据能否在视角方向上移动来过滤图像视图，将不可导航或次要视图判为背景；2) 使用大语言模型提取与导航有关的指令片段以标注文本token的重要性；3) 在预过滤后主要对背景token进行剪枝，保留前景token；4) 基于节点重要性去除低重要性的导航节点以降低回溯；5) 在标准VLN基准上评估FLOPS与成功率的权衡。

Result: NAP在VLN任务中通过导航感知的预过滤将token分为前景和背景，优先对背景token进行剪枝，从而在减少计算量的同时尽量保持导航性能。方法包括基于可导航方向过滤图像视图、用大语言模型提取导航相关的指令片段，以及通过移除低重要性的导航节点来减少回溯。实验表明在标准基准上NAP在保存成功率方面优于已有方法，并节省超过50%的FLOPS。

Conclusion: NAP利用导航特性进行token预过滤并结合节点重要性筛选，有效减少计算量且保持或提高导航成功率，是VLN场景下token剪枝的实用策略。

Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token
pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss
by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges.
For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase
computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify
uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To
address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses
navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering
tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered
based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract
navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,
we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further
help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by
removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN
benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher
success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

### [7] [RespoDiff: Dual-Module Bottleneck Transformation for Responsible & Faithful T2I Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15257)
*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Sauradip Nag,Muhammad Awais,Serge Belongie,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RespoDiff：对扩散模型瓶颈表示施加双模块和新的分数匹配损失，实现在不损失图像质量的前提下同时提升公平性/安全性与语义对齐，实验显示约20%改进并兼容SDXL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有负责生成方法通常以牺牲语义保真度和图像质量为代价来提升公平性与安全性。目标是找到一种能同时保持高质量与语义一致性又能提升责任性的方案。

Method: 在扩散模型的中间瓶颈表示上设计两个可学习模块：一个负责捕捉和强制执行责任性概念（公平性/安全性），另一个保持对中性提示的语义对齐；并提出一种新的基于分数匹配的目标函数以协调两模块的联合学习，可无缝集成到大规模模型（如SDXL）。

Result: 在未见提示上，相较于最先进方法，RespoDiff在责任性与语义一致性评估上平均提升约20%，并能保持图像保真度且可扩展到大型模型。

Conclusion: RespoDiff提出通过在扩散模型的中间瓶颈表示上引入双模块变换来同时提高责任性（公平性与安全性）和语义一致性，实现了在不牺牲图像质量的情况下优化两者。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and
semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and
safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness
and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work,
we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image
generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate
bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two
distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible
concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining
semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning
process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective
coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while
optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach
improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across
diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale
models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

### [8] [Autoguided Online Data Curation for Diffusion Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15267)
*Valeria Pais,Luis Oala,Daniele Faccio,Marco Aversa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文比较了autoguidance与在线数据选择（如JEST）在训练扩散生成模型时对时间和样本效率的影响。作者将两者集成在统一代码库，在受控2D合成与图像生成任务上以相同时间和样本数进行对比。结果表明：autoguidance在样本质量与多样性上持续受益；早期应用的JEST（AJEST）在数据效率上可与autoguidance匹敌或略好，但其额外时间开销和复杂度使得在大多数情况下autoguidance或随机采样更实用。论文结论是：早期目标性在线选择在训练初期可能有助，但稳健的样本质量提升主要来自autoguidance。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考虑到生成模型的计算成本，研究人员希望通过更有效的数据策划（在线选择或自引导）来提高训练的时间与样本效率，从而降低训练成本并提高样本质量与多样性。

Method: 在统一代码库中将JEST（联合样本选择）与autoguidance集成，做消融和基准测试。在受控2D合成任务与3x64x64图像生成任务上比较多种数据策划策略。比较基于相同的壁钟时间与相同的样本数，并显式计入选择开销。还测试了早期只应用选择的策略（AJEST）。

Result: 实验显示 autoguidance 一致提升样本质量与多样性；早期的 AJEST 在数据效率上可匹配或略优于 autoguidance，但其时间开销和复杂度限制了实用性；总体上，autoguidance 或均匀随机采样在大多数场景下更可取。

Conclusion: Autoguidance 是提升生成扩散模型样本质量与多样性的主要驱动力；早期有限次的数据选择（AJEST）能在样本效率上带来小幅优势，但其时间开销与复杂性通常使得直接使用 autoguidance 或均匀随机选择更为实用。

Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for
efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently
developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time
and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate
joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for
fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a
controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image
generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number
of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across
experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity.
Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or
modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However,
its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data
selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while
targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust
sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss
limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

### [9] [PRISM: Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15270)
*Emanuele Ricco,Elia Onofri,Lorenzo Cima,Stefano Cresci,Roberto Di Pietro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PRISM：一种利用径向频域相位/幅度特征并辅以LDA的可扩展图像指纹方法，在跨模型与跨数据集的生成模型归属与真伪检测任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业与监管场景对AI生成内容来源可追溯性的紧迫需求，需在黑箱条件下可靠识别生成模型。

Method: 基于离散傅里叶变换的径向降维，结合相位增强和幅度特征，并用线性判别分析（LDA）做聚类/分类。

Result: 在自建PRISM-36K数据集上达92.04%归属准确率；在四个文献基准上平均81.60%；真伪检测平均88.41%，在GenImage上95.06%。

Conclusion: PRISM通过频域的相位与幅度信息提取模型特征，实现对生成图像的高精度模型归属与真伪检测。

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is,
solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This
feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive
in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and
expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address
these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image
Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is
based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages
amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The
output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant
analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the
model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct
PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN-
and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution
accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from
the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate
our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images,
achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage
with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for
cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable
solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

### [10] [Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271)
*Sebastian Ray Mason,Anders Gjølbye,Phillip Chavarria Højbjerg,Lenka Tětková,Lars Kai Hansen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 自监督视觉变换器比监督版本更能捕捉几何结构，中间层表征对心理旋转任务最有用，难度与旋转复杂性和遮挡相关，类似人类反应特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现代视觉变换器在类人心理旋转任务上的表现，探究它们是否发展出类似人类的空间推理能力。

Method: 逐层探测模型表征，在从简单到复杂的多类旋转任务上比较ViT、CLIP、DINOv2和DINOv3的性能，包括Shepard–Metzler风格块图、复杂块形、不同文本类型和照片级对象，分析不同层次与模型训练范式的表现差异。

Result: 通过系统性评估ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, DINOv3在多种心理旋转任务上的表现，发现自监督ViT在几何结构捕捉上优于监督ViT，中间层表现优于最终层，任务难度随旋转复杂性与遮挡增加而上升。

Conclusion: 视觉变换器的中间层自发编码了几何和旋转信息，但训练方式和层级选择影响其空间推理能力，提示未来模型设计应重视自监督信号与中层表征。

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been
central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success
of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models
develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from
simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study
human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and
photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we
examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised
ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate
layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with
rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and
suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

### [11] [Which Direction to Choose? An Analysis on the Representation Power of Self-Supervised ViTs in Downstream Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15272)
*Yannis Kaltampanidis,Alexandros Doumanoglou,Dimitrios Zarpalas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper systematically tests unmodified final-layer ViT tokens (K/Q/V/FFN) using simple hyperplane or cosine rules for classification/segmentation, revealing which token and rule work best depending on task, few-shot/standard regimes, and pretraining (contrastive vs MIM)


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate intrinsic representational quality of final-block ViT tokens (keys/queries/values/FFN outputs) without extra heads/transforms, across tasks and pretraining objectives

Method: Systematic analysis of unaltered ViT features

Result: Identified optimal token types and decision rules per task/context; provided guidelines for using raw ViT features in classification and segmentation, with empirical results on two datasets

Conclusion: Raw ViT features contain strong task-specific directions; choice of token and decision rule significantly affects downstream performance, enabling competitive results without added transformation layers

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently
demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in
standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate
the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image
Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention
block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features
obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common
foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing
approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through
additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined
with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods
can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive
analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features
has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically
evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and
segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification
and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic
regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of
interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules
and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an
analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study
provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule
based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting
detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出FoMER基准，评估大规模多模态模型（LMM）在具身环境中逐步推理能力，包含1.1k样本、10个任务、8种体现形式，着重分离感知与行动推理，分析多种领先模型的表现，揭示了LMM在具身推理上的潜力与局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检查基础模型在现实物理环境中的逐步结构化推理能力，弥补现有研究集中在视觉或语言单一能力而忽视具身决策与安全性的空白。

Method: 构建大规模具身推理任务集，设计评价框架以分离感知（视觉理解）与行动推理（生成下步动作），并对多款领先LMM进行定量与定性评估，使用逐步推理标注作为参考。

Result: 在10个任务和3类机器人上评估得出：部分LMM能理解场景并给出合理行动，但在复杂物理约束与安全要求下常出错，整体性能不足以替代专用具身规划系统。

Conclusion: FoMER显示当前LMM在具身推理中尚不成熟，存在感知与行动推理脱节、物理与安全约束理解不足等问题，需要更多专门方法提升鲁棒性和任务特定学习。

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are
not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context.
While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising
capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to
perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models
can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we
propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making
scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to
interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and
safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a
large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation
framework that disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and
(iii) empirical analysis of several leading LMMs under this setting. Our
benchmark includes over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning
across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, covering three different robot types. Our
results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LMMs in
embodied reasoning, pointing towards key challenges and opportunities for
future research in robot intelligence. Our data and code will be made publicly
available.

TL;DR: CoDoL利用域条件提示和轻量域元网络为CLIP生成域与实例相关的提示，改善视-语对齐并提升多域OOD泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的CLIP方法受限于文本描述不准确和视听-语言嵌入对齐不足，导致零-shot与OOD泛化能力下降；利用可得的域信息可改善提示设计与对齐。

Method: 基于CLIP的提示学习，构造条件化域提示（Domain prompts）并引入Domain Meta Network(DMN)为每个域生成输入依赖的token，从而同时捕捉实例级与域级信息，增强视觉-语言对齐。

Result: 在PACS、VLCS、OfficeHome与DigitDG四个OOD基准上，CoDoL显著提升了对齐质量与域泛化表现，实验证明其有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的CoDoL通过使用域信息构造条件化提示并结合轻量的域元网络生成输入条件化token，能提升视觉-语言嵌入对齐和OOD泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.,
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great
potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite
showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer
from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and
robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited
vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the
generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes
readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the
vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To
capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further
propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional
tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks
(PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed
CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as
the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AdaptiveNN，一种将视觉感知建模为粗到细、序列决策的主动自适应框架，通过自奖励强化学习与表征学习联合训练，无需额外注释即可端到端训练。18个任务评估显示在不降低精度下推理成本可降最多28倍，能在不同资源预算下灵活运行并生成可解释的注视模式，且多方面模仿人类感知行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流视觉模型被动处理全图，计算资源随输入分辨率和模型规模急剧增长，限制了实际应用与未来发展；人类视觉通过序列注视高效采样环境，启发提出主动自适应的视觉系统以提升效率与可解释性。

Method: 提出粗到细的序列决策过程：模型逐步选择感兴趣区域进行注视、跨注视融合信息并自适时终止观察；采用表征学习+自奖励强化学习的理论框架，实现对非可微选择过程的端到端训练，无需注视位置监督。

Result: 在9类任务、17个基准上评估，AdaptiveNN在不损失准确率的情况下实现最高28倍推理成本降低，可在不同任务需求和资源预算间灵活调整，提供可解释的注视轨迹，并在若干情形下呈现与人类相似的感知行为。

Conclusion: AdaptiveNN成功将被动视觉模型转为主动、自适应的感知系统，在多种任务上显著降低计算成本且保持性能，适应性强且可解释，并能部分再现人类视觉行为，具备实际应用与认知研究价值。

Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments
by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing
machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in
excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and
model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and
real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework
aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision
models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential
decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions
pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,
and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory
integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,
enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without
additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17
benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,
fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving
and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side
comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction
without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and
resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via
its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,
flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits
closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential
as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at

TL;DR: LowDiff用单一模型按从低到高分辨率级联生成图像，减少高分辨率采样步骤，实现>50%速度提升且不损失质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高扩散模型的采样效率，通过利用多分辨率输入和级联生成减少高分辨率采样步骤。

Method: 设计统一的多分辨率级联架构，逐步从低分辨率生成并用少量高分辨率采样步骤精炼结果；同时在像素空间和潜在空间均可应用，结合特定训练与采样技术实现效率与质量的权衡。

Result: 提出LowDiff，一个级联且统一模型的多分辨率逐步细化框架，在保持或提升生成质量的同时显著提高吞吐量（>50%）。在CIFAR-10、FFHQ、ImageNet上取得优秀FID/IS指标。

Conclusion: LowDiff通过多分辨率级联与统一逐级精炼模型，在像素和潜在空间扩散模型上都能显著提升采样效率并保持或提高样本质量，适用于多种数据集与任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior
efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or
reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the
possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.
In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework
based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution
outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine
images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed
architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even
superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is
applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive
experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across
CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our
method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and
settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional
CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional
CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an
FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1
produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together
with substantial efficiency gains.

*Yu Chang,Jiahao Chen,Anzhe Cheng,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskAttn-SDXL inserts learned binary masks into cross-attention logits of SDXL to sparsify interactions, fixing compositional errors (entanglement, attribute mixing, spatial violations) in multi-object prompts with little overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional failures in text-to-image diffusion models—entities entangle, attributes mix, spatial cues violated—especially with multi-object prompts; need method to enforce correct composition without heavy overhead.

Method: Learn binary mask per UNet layer; inject into each cross-attention logit map before softmax to zero out irrelevant token-to-latent connections; train without auxiliary tokens, positional encodings, or external region masks; maintain original inference path with negligible compute overhead.

Result: Proposed MaskAttn-SDXL: region-level binary masks applied to cross-attention logits in SDXL's UNet before softmax, sparsifying token-to-latent interactions; no positional encodings or external masks needed; improves spatial compliance and attribute binding while preserving image quality and diversity.

Conclusion: Logit-level masked cross-attention is a data-efficient primitive for compositional control; MaskAttn-SDXL is a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer
from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and
spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities
entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To
address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating
mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s
UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each
cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent
interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The
method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region
masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In
practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in
multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.
These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an
data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method
thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image
generation.

*Mst Tasnim Pervin,George Bebis,Fang Jiang,Alireza Tavakkoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RaceGAN，通过多域风格编码无参考地翻译种族特征，保持个体性和语义，实验证明在Chicago Face Dataset上优于现有方法并用分类与聚类评估效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translate racial traits across multiple domains without needing a reference image, while preserving identity and high-level semantics.

Method: Multi-domain image-to-image translation using a GAN that learns explicit style codes per domain to perform reference-free racial attribute translation while enforcing identity and semantic preservation; evaluated with InceptionReNetv2 classifier and latent space clustering analyses.

Result: RaceGAN framework that maps style codes across several domains for racial attribute translation, preserves individuality and semantics, outperforms other models on Chicago Face Dataset, validated with InceptionReNetv2 classification and latent space clustering analysis.

Conclusion: RaceGAN can translate racial attributes among Asian, White, Black domains while preserving identity and semantics without reference images; shows superior quantitative and qualitative performance and forms distinct latent clusters per ethnicity.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress
in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several
applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was
restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling
image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to
map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via
reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of
StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and
need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to
translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We
present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several
domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and
high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms
other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black)
when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings
utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the
model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each
ethnic group.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解释方法要么只给出单图像的局部可视化，要么依赖大量概念注释。通过高效利用少量部件标注并将其扩展，可在大规模上提供人类可读的全局解释，同时大幅降低标注成本。

Method: 从有限标注样本中学习部件表示并进行半监督或弱监督的标签传递（例如通过聚类、相似性传播或图匹配），将部件标签扩展到未标注样本；对每张图像生成局部部件重要性评分并聚合为全局符号规则或统计描述。

Result: 提出一种半监督的零散标签传递方法，将少量用户标注的图像部件标签扩展到大规模数据集，以便通过聚合局部部件解释生成全局符号化解释，从而为深度模型决策提供可理解的人类可读解释。

Conclusion: 该方法在标注成本低的情况下，能生成可扩展的、可理解的全局解释，为模型决策提供人类可读的部件级证据，弥补了仅针对单张图像的局部可视化方法和需要大量注释的概念方法之间的空白。

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods
often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images.
Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive
annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that
leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently
transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global
symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately
providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large
scale.

Motivation: 现有来源鉴定方法依赖模型特定线索或合成伪迹，泛化能力差；作者认为应捕捉图像生成因果关系中的模型痕迹以得到更完整的指纹。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型的重构残差构建语义不变潜在空间，设计因果解耦框架以分离模型指纹，并通过多样化特征表示提高指纹颗粒度；同时使用反事实样本验证因果性并进行来源匿名化。

Result: 在多个代表性GAN和扩散模型上，所提方法在模型归属鉴定上优于已有方法，并能通过反事实生成实现来源匿名化，展示在伪造检测、模型版权追溯和身份保护方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了“因果指纹”概念，通过在语义不变的潜在空间中将模型痕迹与图像内容/风格解耦，来更稳健地进行生成模型来源鉴定。

Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which
are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source
attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts,
yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different
generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect
the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely
unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of
generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that
disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant
latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We
further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.
We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across
representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization
using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments
show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating
strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity
protection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将自监督预训练的神经肿瘤基础模型与分布稳健优化相结合，可获得更具站点不变性的表征，显著改善对常见和罕见分子标志物及生存的预测；需进一步前瞻性验证与纳入纵向/干预信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在异质性强的神经肿瘤影像数据上通用性差，且对罕见分子标志物预测性能低下；因此需要一种兼顾表征泛化与对少数类稳健性的优化策略。

Method: 在多机构脑肿瘤MRI数据上用四种自监督方法预训练骨干网络，随后采用分布稳健优化来缓解站点与类别不平衡。下游任务包括常见（MGMT、IDH1、1p/19q、EGFR）与罕见分子标志物（ATRX、TP53、CDKN2A/2B、TERT）、连续标志物（Ki-67、TP53）以及IDH1野生型胶质母细胞瘤的生存预测；在UCSF、UPenn、CUIMC三个机构进行评估。

Result: 在CUIMC站点，平均平衡准确率从0.744提升至0.785，AUC从0.656提升至0.676；对少数类改进显著（如CDKN2A/2B准确率0.86->0.92、AUC0.73->0.92；ATRX AUC0.69->0.82；Ki-67准确率0.60->0.69）。生存预测c-index在三个站点均有提高（CUIMC 0.592->0.597，UPenn 0.647->0.672，UCSF 0.600->0.627）。Grad-CAM显示模型聚焦于肿瘤及周围区域，增强了解释性。

Conclusion: 本文提出将分布稳健优化（DRO）与针对神经肿瘤的基础模型（FM）结合，通过在多机构脑肿瘤MRI上自监督预训练（BYOL、DINO、MAE、MoCo）并在下游任务中应用DRO，提高了模型对常见与罕见分子标志物的预测能力，同时减小了站点间的表征差异，进而提升了生存预测能力。

Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to
heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation
models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in
predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment
response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a
neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,
enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining
cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones
(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class
imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers
(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),
continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1
wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular
prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean
balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with
the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to
0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).
For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647
to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral
regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields
more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon
markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for
prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional
signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

TL;DR: ORCA是在测试时用小型视觉模型进行多轮结构化推理与交叉验证的框架，能在不改动LVLM的前提下显著降低幻觉并提升对抗鲁棒性，兼具可审计性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs虽具强大多模态能力，但易受内在幻觉与外部对抗攻击影响，需一种无需重训练即可增强事实准确性和鲁棒性的测试时方法。

Method: 在推理阶段串联多个小视觉工具（<3B参数），以证据驱动的问题查询图像信息，交叉验证模型间不一致性并迭代精炼预测，同时记录中间推理轨迹用于可审计性。

Result: 在POPE幻觉基准与AMBER对抗评估上，ORCA在干净图像和对抗扰动下均显著提升LVLM性能：POPE上提高+3.64%至+40.67%；对抗扰动上平均提升+20.11%；与防御结合在AMBER上额外提升+1.20%至+48.00%。

Conclusion: ORCA通过在测试时调用小型视觉模型进行Observe–Reason–Critique–Act循环推理，显著提升了预训练大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的事实性和对抗鲁棒性，且无需微调模型或访问模型内部。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities
but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial
attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world
applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the
factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through
test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models
(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act
loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating
cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without
access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate
reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed
primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent
adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense
mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on
hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,
and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE
hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\%
to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,
ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined
with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further
improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to
+48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers
a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

TL;DR: RAD-Conv用每元素四边界偏移构造可变矩形采样区，解耦感受野形状与核结构，兼顾注意力的适应性与卷积的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积感受野形状固定且难以适应复杂图像结构；注意力机制虽具可适配性但计算昂贵。提出一种既具适应性又高效的算子以桥接两者。

Method: 对传统可变形卷积进行扩展，使用四个边界偏移（上下左右）为每个核位置定义可变矩形区域，解耦感受野形状与核结构，允许在小核（例如1x1）上获得长程依赖，同时保持标准卷积的计算效率。

Result: RAD-Conv在保持或接近卷积效率的同时，提高了对局部细节和长程依赖的建模能力，有望在视觉模型上提升表达力与效率；具体定量结果需参考全文实验。

Conclusion: RAD-Conv提出了一种通过对每个卷积核元素使用四个边界偏移来自适应地生成矩形采样区域的新算子，能够灵活调整感受野的宽高，以更好匹配图像结构。

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new
convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to
complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are
limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary
offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that
dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach
allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling
the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small
1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's
structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the
efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical
solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the
gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly
attention-based methods.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于边的本征表述（CAGE），显著提高了从点云密度图重建矢量楼层平面图的鲁棒性与几何连贯性，取得了显著的实验指标提升。

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a
\textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly
from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations
are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in
fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage
structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine
geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native}
edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed,
geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of
coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room
boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this
design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed
and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes
optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on
Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\%
(angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained
models will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 受限于带标签数据稀缺与模型在训练分布过拟合，该研究尝试利用庞大的无标签、纵向且多模态医疗数据，通过自监督学习提高诊断模型的泛化能力并减少对标注的依赖。

Method: 作者构建了含CT与电子健康记录(EHR)的无标签患者集，对JEPA进行自监督预训练，之后在有标签数据上做监督微调，并与无正则多模态模型及影像单模态模型比较。还设计了合成环境来分析JEPA在何种语境下会表现不佳。

Result: 在内部队列上，JEPA微调后AUC=0.91，优于无正则多模态(0.88)和影像单模态(0.73)。但在外部队列上，JEPA AUC=0.72，低于影像单模态0.75，表明泛化不足。合成实验帮助揭示了导致性能下降的上下文因素。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了用多模态、纵向无标签医疗档案进行JEPA自监督预训练能在内部数据上显著提升肺结节诊断性能，但在外部队列上表现下降，提示存在泛化问题。

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is
limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to
overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised
learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges.
We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic
health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive
architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our
approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model
in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC),
but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC).
We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA
may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled
multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its
advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

Conclusion: EDGE提出了一种高效的生成式多模态数据集蒸馏方法，通过生成模型训练流程与双向对比损失、样本多样性损失以及字幕合成策略，解决了图像与文本相关性不足与样本多样性不足的问题，显著提升了检索性能与蒸馏效率。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset,
enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With
the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the
importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown
significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are
constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which
significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to
process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative
distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation.
Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets
with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and
captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow
with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we
propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval
performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on
Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and
efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves
results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

TL;DR: OpenViGA：一个基于开源预训练模型并在BDD100K上微调的可复现驾驶场景视频生成系统，分为tokenizer、world model和decoder三模块，公开代码与模型，能在256x256分辨率、4fps下实现低延迟视频预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前同类工作体量大、训练资源要求高、设计细节不透明且缺乏开源代码和数据，限制了可复现性与社区研究。本工作旨在提供一个可复现、资源友好且基于开源组件的替代方案，并对设计选择给出深入分析。

Method: 将视频生成任务拆分为三个模块：图像分词器（tokenizer）、世界模型（future state predictor）和视频解码器；全部基于开源预训练模型，并在BDD100K数据集上进行微调；通过统一接口将三部分串联成完整系统。

Result: 实现了在学术级GPU上、仅用公开数据和开源预训练模型微调下，能够生成逼真的驾驶场景视频，并对三个模块进行了定量与定性评估；代码和模型已在Github公开。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了开放的驾驶场景视频生成系统OpenViGA，强调可复现性与基于开源预训练模型的工程化实现，能在256x256、4fps条件下实现仅一帧延迟的逐帧视频预测。

Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic
automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future
state prediction (world model), and video decoding to dedicated models. These
approaches often utilize large models that require significant training
resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly
available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and
present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving
scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video
generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components
of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image
tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful
pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by
publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale.
Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces
of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models
and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and
models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict
realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of
algorithmic latency.

*Vaibhav Mishra,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 系统性分析六个病理学基础模型的表征：模型间差异显著，切片特异性强、疾病信号弱，染色归一化可部分缓解，视觉-语言范式产生更紧凑表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究比较CPath基础模型的下游任务性能，但对其内部表征结构与跨模型变异性的理解不足；解析这些表征有助于改进模型鲁棒性、集成策略与安全部署。

Method: 采用计算神经科学常用的表征相似性分析（RSA）与内在维数估计，基于TCGA的H&E切片图像补丁比较六个CPath基础模型（CONCH, PLIP, KEEP, UNI v2, Virchow v2, Prov-GigaPath），并评估染色归一化对表征的影响与滑片/疾病依赖性。

Result: 发现UNI2与Virchow2表征差异最大，Prov-Gigapath与其他模型相似度最高；同训练范式的模型并不总表现为高相似性；所有模型表征高度依赖切片来源，疾病相关信号较弱；染色归一化可降低切片依赖（降低幅度5.5%~20.5%）；视觉-语言模型内禀维数较小，视觉-仅模型表示更分布式。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了不同病理领域基础模型在表征空间上的显著差异，强调训练范式与模型表示之间并非简单对应关系，且大多数模型的表示高度依赖切片特异性但对疾病信息依赖较低。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology
(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent
studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the
structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we
systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation
models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models
analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and
self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through
representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find
that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,
whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having
the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee
higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a
high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain
normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%
(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language
models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more
distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight
opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model
ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape
model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging
domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can
help ensure effective development and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的VLM过于庞大，难以在仓储、机器人等资源受限场景部署，需要高效且具空间理解能力的模型。

Method: 提出一个融合RGB与深度信息的轻量级视觉-语言网络，并通过三阶段课程学习（视觉-语言对齐、空间关系学习、任务适应）训练。

Result: 在仓储空间推理基准上，600M参数的SmolRGPT与更大模型相比表现相当或更好。

Conclusion: SmolRGPT在有限参数下实现了有效的区域级空间推理，适合资源受限环境部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful
multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on
extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements.
This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments
such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both
efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we
present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly
incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth
cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual
and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts
to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters,
SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial
reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger
alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable
multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial
reasoning capabilities. The code of the experimentation will be available at:

Motivation: 解决个性化视频生成中从单一静态人像保持身份一致性与细节保真，同时兼顾时间连贯性与文本提示遵循的问题。

Method: 基于开源Diffusion Transformer (DiT)骨干，提出两个轻量级适配器：ID-adapter（使用Perceiver Resampler将ArcFace人脸嵌入转换为紧凑身份tokens进行条件化）和Ref-adapter（通过冻结参考通路的密集VAE特征，跨注意力注入到所有Transformer层以保留细节）。

Conclusion: Lynx实现了从单张图像生成个性化视频的高保真方案，成功在身份保真、时间一致性和视觉真实感之间取得平衡，并在基准评测上优于同类方法。

Abstract: We present Lynx, a high-fidelity model for personalized video synthesis from
a single input image. Built on an open-source Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
foundation model, Lynx introduces two lightweight adapters to ensure identity
fidelity. The ID-adapter employs a Perceiver Resampler to convert
ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for
conditioning, while the Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen
reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers
through cross-attention. These modules collectively enable robust identity
preservation while maintaining temporal coherence and visual realism. Through
evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which
yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance,
competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the
state of personalized video generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法难以准确识别引发后门的参数；尽管微调方法表现优越，但剪枝在可解释性和低数据鲁棒性上具有优势，因而需要新的剪枝策略来提升去后门效果。

Method: 将剪枝与可逆掩码和样本特定扰动合并，构建双层优化：内层用逆掩码合成候选触发器，外层优化掩码与选择变量以压制后门而不损害干净样本准确率。

Result: 实验显示该方法优于现有剪枝基线，在有限数据情况下保持强性能，并与最先进微调方法竞争，尤其在恢复被感染样本的正确预测方面效果显著。

Conclusion: 本文提出一种带学习选择机制和可逆掩码的剪枝方法，能在去除后门行为的同时保留/复原主任务性能，并在低数据环境下表现稳健。

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against
backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches
often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters
responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of
fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior
performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater
interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we
propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism
to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an
\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two
complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through
the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that
jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and
sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner
problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer
problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing
clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains
strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the
proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions
for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MEC-Quant，用最小编码长度近似熵并结合MOE，优化表征结构以减少量化引入的偏差，在低比特量化下取得接近或超越全精度的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低比特量化引入表征偏差，导致QAT性能落后于全精度模型；需要一个更有原则的目标来约束表征结构，从而降低偏差并改善泛化。

Method: 提出基于最小编码长度作为熵的可计算替代项，将目标与MOE（专家混合）结合以实现可扩展、快速计算并处理长尾分布；在训练中端到端优化该目标。

Result: 在多个计算机视觉任务上，MEC-Quant在极低比特条件下仍能达到或超过全精度模型的准确率，达到新的QAT最优。

Conclusion: 量化会导致表征偏差，MEC-Quant通过最大熵编码目标减少表征偏差，提升低比特量化性能；实验表明在多个视觉任务上超过或接近全精度性能，刷新QAT最优。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce
efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances
compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that
quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation,
especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled
objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so
that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to
unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we
propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a
computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a
scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that
not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution
for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on
computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT
is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of
MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells
and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

<details>

Motivation: 现有GUI定位方法在高分辨率截图的细粒度定位上表现不足，需动态聚焦重要区域并根据任务复杂度调整推理策略。

Method: 提出Adaptive Region Perception (ARP)用于根据视觉注意力裁剪任务相关区域，和Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC)用于在单阶段与多阶段推理之间自适应切换；采用两阶段训练：先监督微调，再用基于Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)的强化微调。

Result: GUI-ARP在ScreenSpot-Pro上（7B模型）达到60.8%准确率，在UI-Vision上达到30.9%；GUI-ARP-7B的性能接近甚至优于多参数更大的模型（如72B），体现出效率与效果兼备。

Conclusion: GUI-ARP通过自适应多阶段推理显著提升GUI定位精度，并在多个基准上取得了先进水平。

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization
in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel
framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the
proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC),
GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant
regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference
for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is
achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding
benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9%
on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness
against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

Motivation: 现有自回归世界模型在视觉连贯性、空间结构保持、解码效率及运动建模方面存在不足，限制了长期预测与控制性能，故提出一种混合解码与运动提示机制以提升时空一致性与推理效率。

Method: SAMPO结合视觉自回归用于帧内生成与因果模型用于帧间生成；采用尺度内并行的双向空间注意力与时间因果解码；提出不对称多尺度Tokenizer：保留观测帧细节、为未来帧提取紧凑动态表示；引入轨迹感知运动提示模块注入时空轨迹线索以聚焦动态区域。

Conclusion: SAMPO通过在尺度内并行的因果-双向混合解码和不对称多尺度Tokenizer以及轨迹感知运动提示，显著提升了视频世界模型的时空一致性和推理效率。总体上，SAMPO在动作条件视频预测和模型控制任务上实现了更高的生成质量和4.4倍更快的推理速度，并表现出良好的零样本泛化与扩展性。

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined
environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However,
existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent
predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and
inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise
\textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt
(\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive
modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame
generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with
bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports
parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both
temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene
understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves
spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations
for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.
Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects
spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on
dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.
Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in
action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving
generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's
zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SyDES：通过低分辨率全局对齐与高分辨率子图MIM、双向跨模态解码器与混合尺度策略，实现对图文互导的对称双向学习，在MSED上带来小幅但稳定的多任务性能提升（desire +1.1% F1等）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于：现有情感分析方法偏重文本，忽视图像作为补充非语言线索；多模态方法在欲望（desire）理解上研究不足；需要有效提取图像中与主观意图相关的表征并增强跨模态互导。

Method: 方法包括：使用低分辨率整图进行跨模态全局对齐；将高分辨率图像裁切为子图并采用掩码图像建模（MIM）以捕捉细粒度局部特征；引入文本引导的图像解码器和图像引导的文本解码器以实现深度跨模态交互；采用混合尺度图像策略在感知增益与计算成本间权衡。

Result: 在MSED数据集（包含desire理解、emotion与sentiment任务）上，方法对比SOTA取得一致改进：desire F1提升1.1%，emotion提升0.6%，sentiment提升0.9%。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一个对称双向的多模态学习框架（SyDES），通过文本引导图像解码器与图像引导文本解码器实现文本与图像之间的相互引导，以提升意图（desire）、情感与情绪识别性能。

Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to
both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and
emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire
understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis
predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary
non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional
Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,
which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively
capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,
low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for
cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into
sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to
capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an
image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal
interaction at both local and global representations of image information.
Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale
image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into
sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a
multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as
emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent
improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding,
0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis. Our code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一个无训练框架，改进Sa2VA在Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS)任务上的表现。关键在于引入视频-语言检查器（验证查询中主体与动作是否在视频中出现，减少误报）和关键帧采样器（自适应选取信息丰富帧以捕捉早期出现和长程时序信息）。在MeViS测试集上实现64.14% J&F，ICCV 2025 LSVOS挑战赛RVOS赛道第二名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有将LLM与SAM结合的方法（如Sa2VA）在RVOS上存在误报和时序信息抓取不充分的问题。通过训练-free模块增强语义校验和关键帧选择，可显著提升分割准确性与鲁棒性，并保持不需再训练的优势。

Method: 方法包括两个模块：1) Video-Language Checker：对自然语言查询与视频内容进行显式校验，判断描述的主体与动作是否存在，以过滤错误的分割候选；2) Key-Frame Sampler：基于自适应准则选取关键帧，兼顾早期目标出现和长时程上下文，用于引导分割流程。整个系统为训练-free，基于现有Sa2VA架构进行增强。

Result: 在MeViS测试集上取得J&F 64.14%，在ICCV 2025第7届LSVOS挑战赛RVOS赛道获得第二名。

Conclusion: 通过引入Video-Language Checker和Key-Frame Sampler的训练-free框架，显著降低误报并提升时序信息捕获能力，从而在RVOS任务上达到优异效果（MeViS J&F 64.14%），证明无需额外训练也可强化基于LLM+SAM的方法。

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a
video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between
vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large
Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning
capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a
training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the
RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language
Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in
the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and
(2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better
capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without
any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the
MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge
at ICCV 2025.

TL;DR: 提出MS-GS，一种在稀疏视角与多外观下基于3D高斯散点的场景重建与新视图合成方法。通过单目深度几何先验、基于SfM点的局部语义区域对齐，以及几何引导的虚拟视点监督（粗细粒度）提升3D一致性，降低过拟合，并在真实环境数据集上取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实拍摄集合常常视图稀少且存在多外观（不同时间或季节），传统NeRF/3DGS在此场景下易过平滑或过拟合，需新的方法提升几何与外观一致性。

Method: 基于单目深度估计提供几何先验，利用SfM点锚定提取局部语义区域以可靠对齐和提供几何线索；在虚拟视点上引入几何引导的多视角监督，分为细粒度与粗粒度约束，增强3D一致性并抑制过拟合；引入新数据集与真实场景评测。

Result: 在所构建的数据集和多项实景测试中，MS-GS在图像质量和保留细节方面显著优于现有方法，能在稀疏与多外观条件下实现高保真渲染。

Conclusion: MS-GS在稀疏视图与多外观场景下能生成更逼真的渲染结果，显著优于现有NeRF和3DGS变体，减少过拟合并提升几何与外观一致性。

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and
exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons,
posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are
prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework
designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using
3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our
approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth
estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions
with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable
alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we
propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a
fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce
overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting
to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves
photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and
multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly
across different datasets.

*Tian Lan,Yiming Zheng,Jianxin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Diff-Feat：提取并融合扩散-Transformer的中间特征，通过局部搜索选取图像/文本最佳块与时间步，简单线性融合后在多标签分类上显著优于基线并形成更紧凑语义簇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签分类依赖能捕捉标签间相互作用的强表示。利用扩散模型中潜在的富含语义的中间表征，探索是否能通过简单融合提升多模态分类性能。

Method: 从预训练的扩散-Transformer（DiT等）中提取不同时刻（不同noise timestep）和不同Transformer块的中间特征；基于观察设计局部搜索启发式算法选取最佳的图像-文本×块-时间步组合；将所选表示通过线性投影融合并相加用于下游分类。

Result: 在MS-COCO-enhanced上达成98.6% mAP，在Visual Genome 500上达成45.7% mAP，超越强CNN、图模型和Transformer基线；t-SNE和聚类指标显示融合表示语义聚类更紧凑。

Conclusion: Diff-Feat通过从预训练的扩散-Transformer模型中提取中间表征并融合，实现了在多标签分类任务上的显著性能提升，视觉与文本模态在最佳层级和时间步上存在不同规律。

Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful
representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce
\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate
features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and
fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most
discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the
middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for
language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located
in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across
varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best
performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under
DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that
pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a
few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear
projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields
state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on
Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a
wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that
\textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在资源受限环境（RCS）中，AI辅助的视听筛查和远程医疗有扩大早期识别的潜力，但在从纸质工作流向AI化部署过程中面临实际挑战。早期原型、学科间反复协作、影像质量自动检测和持续反馈是关键。公共数据集和模型尽管存在领域迁移问题仍有用。整体应把AI开发与工作流数字化视为端到端的迭代协同设计过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限地区缺乏专科医生和筛查基础设施，导致可预防的视听残疾未能及时发现；AI与远程医疗有潜力扩展检测覆盖，但缺乏面向现场部署的可操作经验和工作流设计指导。

Method: 通过现场高通量筛查营和远程医疗试点的实地经验，总结迭代原型设计、学科交叉团队合作、影像质量自动检测以及纸质到数字化工作流过渡中的关键实践步骤和工具。

Result: 研究发现：1）迭代、跨学科的早期原型和现场（shadow）部署有助于减少可用性障碍；2）公共数据集与模型尽管受域偏移影响，但仍有价值作为起点；3）需构建自动化图像质量检测以保证可判读图像；4）应将AI与工作流数字化视为端到端的协同设计过程。

Conclusion: 在RCS中成功部署可扩展的AI辅助远程医疗与筛查，需要将AI模型开发、影像质量控制、以及工作流数字化作为反复迭代的协同过程，注重早期原型、现场试点和持续的用户反馈；尽管公共数据和模型存在领域差异，但仍可作为起点；同时需加入自动化图像质控以保证可判读影像，从而实现高通量筛查。

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in
paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build
upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to
capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and
workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By
documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address
the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world
AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

*Min Sun,Fenghui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 DC-Mamba：集成时序可变形对齐（BTDA）与尺度稀疏变化放大器（SSCA）的“先对齐后增强”框架，有效降低伪变化并增强微小/微妙变化，F1 由 0.5730 提升至 0.5903，IoU 由 0.4015 提升至 0.4187。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 RSCD 方法对几何错位与噪声区分能力不足，尤其对微小或边界模糊的变化检测表现欠佳，因此需要一个既能校正空间错位又能增强真实微小变化的轻量化方案。

Method: 在 ChangeMamba 主干上加入 BTDA（基于可变形对齐的语义级几何校正）和 SSCA（基于多源线索的尺度稀疏放大器），先做语义对齐后做显著性放大，再进行分类。

Result: DC-Mamba 在 ChangeMamba 基础上提出了“先对齐后增强”的框架，通过两个轻量模块处理几何错位和噪声放大问题。BTDA 在语义特征层引入可变形对齐以校正时序影像的空间错位；SSCA 综合多源线索，在分类前有选择地放大高置信度变化并抑制噪声。该组合先用 BTDA 降低伪变化，再用 SSCA 锐化边界与增强微小目标，实验证明在 F1 和 IoU 上均优于基线。

Conclusion: “先对齐后增强”策略在处理 RSCD 的几何不一致与特征级噪声上有效，且模块轻量可插拔，提升了 ChangeMamba 的检测性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover
changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models
(SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and
struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we
introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the
ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1)
Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric
awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and
(2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to
selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise
before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes
geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA
to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets.
Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong
ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU
from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our
"align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution
that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in
RSCD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR:  proposes brain-inspired Blink-Think-Link framework decomposing GUI interaction into Blink (attention), Think (reasoning), Link (action), plus automated blink annotation and a rule-based process+outcome reward; BTL-UI achieves SOTA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address gap between AI agent interaction logic and natural human-GUI communication by mimicking human cognitive phases

Method: Analyze proposed Blink-Think-Link (BTL) framework for GUI interaction

Result: Introduces BTL framework with Blink Data Generation and BTL Reward; builds BTL-UI agent achieving SOTA on static and dynamic GUI tasks

Conclusion: BTL effectively aligns agent behavior with human-like interaction patterns, improving performance in GUI understanding and interaction benchmarks

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid
advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning
techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists:
their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI
communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL),
a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human
cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes
interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid
detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye
movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring
cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for
precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms.
Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework:
(1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically
optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward
mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and
outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named
BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both
static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive
benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the
framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 发现并修正SOD现有评价对目标尺寸敏感的问题，提出SIEva评价框架和可插拔的SIOpt优化方法，有理论支撑与实验证明，改进了不同尺寸显著目标的检测与评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在同图像中存在显著目标尺寸差异时，现有SOD评价与训练会偏向大目标，导致小但语义重要对象被低估，需设计尺寸不敏感的评价与优化方法。

Method: 通过理论推导展示现有指标可分解为多个与区域大小成正比的可分离项，进而提出SIEva对每个可分离分量单独评估再聚合；提出模型无关的SIOpt优化框架，可整合到多种SOD骨干网络。

Result: 理论分析证明SIEva的合理性并给出泛化性分析；实验表明SIEva和SIOpt能提升小目标检测性能并提供更公平的评价，且SIOpt可无缝集成到多种模型中。

Conclusion: 本文提出并验证了现有SOD评价指标对目标大小敏感，导致大目标主导评估而小目标被忽视，提出了Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva)框架和基于该原则的优化方法SIOpt，改善了不同尺寸显著目标的检测与评价。

Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient
Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,
particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly
different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel
perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD
metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation
outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed
into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being
directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the
prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet
potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading
to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this
challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.
The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then
aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size
imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated
optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle
and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad
range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present
generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the
validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments
speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at

Motivation: 短视频平台上虚假信息传播迅速且模态多样、内容动态变化，现有方法在处理短视频的多模态信息和缺失模态时表现不足，需要一个既能融合异构模态又能动态调整权重以提高检测鲁棒性的模型。

Method: 构建视频、音频、文本三模态特征提取管道；设计Decision Network在推理时根据输入动态调整模态权重；提出Weighted Multi-Modal Feature Fusion模块以在模态不完整时仍能进行有效融合；在FakeTT和新采集的VESV上进行实验对比，使用Macro F1作为主要评估指标。

Conclusion: HFN能在短视频场景下通过动态权重调节和加权融合提高谣言检测性能，并对缺失模态具有鲁棒性；新数据集VESV有助于研究短视频谣言检测。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of short video platforms has necessitated advanced
methods for detecting fake news. This need arises from the widespread influence
and ease of sharing misinformation, which can lead to significant societal
harm. Current methods often struggle with the dynamic and multimodal nature of
short video content. This paper presents HFN, Heterogeneous Fusion Net, a novel
multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and text data to evaluate
the authenticity of short video content. HFN introduces a Decision Network that
dynamically adjusts modality weights during inference and a Weighted
Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with
incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV

Motivation: 当前MLLM在高危、专业领域（如手术）中的表现未被充分评估，需一个兼具视觉与临床知识的基准来衡量模型在感知、理解与推理方面的能力。

Method: 构建大规模注释数据集（210k+ VQA与1048细粒度属性、25k+医学知识三元组）并设计感知/理解/推理任务；在Qwen2.5-VL-7B上进行领域适配得到EyePCR-MLLM，并与多种开源与商业模型比较评估。

Conclusion: EyePCR揭示了现有MLLM在手术认知中的不足，为评估与改进手术视频理解模型的临床可靠性提供了基础。

Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable
capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios
like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we
develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery
analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition
across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}.
EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover
1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph
of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded
reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis,
simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain
knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability.
In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B,
achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared
models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and
\textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals
the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation
for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video

pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and
stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16
representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis
video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key
insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across
tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用LLM把病理報告轉成與WSI相關的細粒度描述，並通過教師-學生自蒸餾過濾WSI噪聲特徵，結合風險感知的mix-up做數據增強，提升WSI基於生存預測效果（CRC與TCGA-BRCA上表現更好）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 傳統WSI生存分析受噪聲特徵和數據有限性限制；病理報告蘊含病人特異性豐富信息，但尚未被充分利用來改進WSI基於生存的預測，因此提出一種將報告文本知識與WSI特徵融合的方法。

Method: 1) 使用精心設計的提示詞讓LLM從噪聲病理報告中提取與WSI相關的細粒度描述；2) 構建教師模型利用文本知識指導學生模型，通過自蒸餾過程過濾或抑制WSI中的無關/冗餘特徵；3) 訓練學生模型時加入風險感知的mix-up策略以增加樣本數量和多樣性。

Result: Proposes Rasa: LLMs extract WSI-relevant text from pathology reports; teacher-student self-distillation filters WSI features; risk-aware mix-up augments training; evaluated on CRC and TCGA-BRCA showing superior performance.

Conclusion: Rasa能有效融合病理報告文本知識和WSI圖像特徵，通過自蒸餾過濾噪聲並用風險感知mix-up提升泛化，實驗證明超越現有方法。

Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for
evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information
essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based
survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility,
hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively.
Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could
assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains
largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary
self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First,
advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained,
WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a
carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is
designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student
model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a
risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student
model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data.
Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data
(TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PCSR框架：用置信度区分干净/噪声样本，利用伪标签一致性（PCS）将噪声样本细分为模糊与可修复子集，分别用稳健损失与文本替换策略优化，提高跨模态检索在噪声监督下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将噪声样本粗粒度划分并统一处理，忽视噪声样本内部差异与样本特性相关的最优训练策略，导致样本利用不足与性能下降。

Method: 1) 置信度估计区分干净/噪声样本；2) 计算伪标签一致性评分（PCS）将噪声样本分为模糊和可修复；3) 对模糊样本采用稳健损失优化，对可修复样本进行文本替换增强；4) 结合APO训练模型。

Result: This paper proposes PCSR framework to handle noisy correspondences in image-text retrieval by dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency and applying adaptive optimization (APO) including robust loss and text replacement; experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO, Flickr30K show improved robustness.

Conclusion: 通过PCS量化预测稳定性并结合APO策略，PCSR能更精细地利用样本，减轻噪声对应关系对相似性学习的误导，从而提升跨模态检索性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic
similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are
perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These
misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval
performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that
simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic
diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform
training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in
suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above
challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label
Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence
reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.
Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish
clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency
to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label
Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the
separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,
we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are
optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text
replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and
Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval
robustness under noisy supervision.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet
privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning
addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight
architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities;
however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated
settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM
framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image
segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized
strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client
commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)
component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled
global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm
via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model
and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach
significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain
adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出生物启发的UNIV，通过PCCL与LoRA+同步蒸馏在Transformer上实现可见光与红外联合建模，并发布98,992对齐图像的MVIP数据集，提升红外任务性能且保留可见光表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可见光与红外联用感知模型在多模态场景下性能不足的问题，提升在恶劣天气等复杂环境中的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于Transformer的通用架构，采用Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning进行注意力引导的跨模态蒸馏，并用LoRA适配器与同步蒸馏的双重机制保留原有知识；同时构建大规模精确对齐的MVIP数据集进行训练和评估。

Conclusion: UNIV能有效对齐可见光与红外特征、避免灾难性遗忘，并在多个任务上取得红外性能提升，同时保持可见光性能近乎不变。

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at

*Donghyun Lee,Dawoon Jeong,Jae W. Lee,Hongil Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-Scale通过将高斯保存在主机内存并在需要时传输到GPU，同时采用选择性卸载、参数转发和延迟优化器更新等系统优化，显著降低GPU显存需求（3.3-5.6x）并在消费级GPU上训练更大模型（如从4M扩展到18M高斯），带来23-35% LPIPS提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D Gaussian Splatting在训练大场景时受限于GPU内存（参数、梯度、优化器状态），限制了高质量和大规模场景的训练，需一种在消费级硬件上可扩展且高效的训练系统。

Method: 将全部高斯参数保存在主机内存；每次前后向仅按视锥裁剪把子集传到GPU；采用（1）选择性卸载几何参数以加速视锥裁剪，（2）参数转发以在CPU优化器更新与GPU计算之间进行流水线，（3）延迟优化器更新以跳过零梯度高斯的无效内存访问。

Result: GS-Scale提出了一种通过主机内存存储高斯并按需传输到GPU的分流训练方案，大幅降低GPU显存占用，同时通过三个系统优化（选择性卸载、参数转发、延迟优化器更新）弥补CPU瓶颈，既能在消费级GPU上训练更大规模场景，又保持接近GPU本地训练的速度，提升了渲染质量。

Conclusion: GS-Scale在不显著降低训练速度的前提下，用主机内存和三项系统级优化实现了高质量、可扩展的3D Gaussian Splatting训练，使得大规模场景可在消费级GPU上训练并提升渲染质量。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by
delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training
large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial
memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,
which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we
propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a
subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this
dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and
optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's
limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three
system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters
for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer
updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize
unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive
evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly
lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds
comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the
number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,
leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)
improvement.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 首次将3D Gaussian Splatting应用于指纹领域，在无需相机参数且仅用稀疏2D图像的条件下，实现了有效的3D配准、完整重建与高质量生成，提升了无接触指纹识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无接触指纹识别性能落后于接触式，主要原因是缺乏具有姿态变化的丰富无接触指纹数据以及缺少隐式3D指纹表示的利用。引入3D Gaussian Splatting旨在弥补数据与表示的不足，提升识别效果。

Result: 实验表明该方法能精确对齐并从2D图像重建出3D指纹模型，且基于该3D模型顺序生成的无接触指纹图像质量高，从而提高了无接触指纹识别的性能。

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless
fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still
lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless
fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D
fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless
fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by
integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for
contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint
reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the
first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of
contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera
parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,
reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and
reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates
high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the
performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

### [51] [A PCA Based Model for Surface Reconstruction from Incomplete Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15675)
*Hao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于PCA估计法向量并结合算子分裂求解的曲面重建模型，能在点云缺失区域推断并重建曲面，实验优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds often have missing regions due to scanning limitations; using PCA to estimate normals provides useful regularization for reconstructing surfaces in those regions.

Method: PCA-based surface reconstruction from incomplete point clouds using operator-splitting

Result: The PCA-estimated normals regularize the reconstruction model; operator-splitting efficiently solves it; experiments show improved reconstruction in missing-data regions compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: PCA估计的法向量作为正则项能有效引导缺失区域的曲面重建，算子分裂方法使求解高效，整体方法在合成与真实数据上均表现良好。

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for
mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an
important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning
process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface
due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in
incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and
successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we
present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface
reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to
estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available
point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in
our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas
with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to
effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we
demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in
data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces,
outperforming existing methodologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将相机表示为3D高斯并对其进行可微分优化，借助表面附近的点相机监督视角分布，从而在新视角合成中优于FVS，能更好捕捉复杂反射与细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善新视角合成中视角选择与优化问题，以更好地捕捉复杂的视图相关现象（如强金属反射和细节纹理），并提供可微分、连续的视角优化框架。

Method: 1) 用3D高斯表示每个已知相机（camera splat）；2) 在场景表面附近采样3D点并放置点相机（point cameras）观察camera splats的分布；3) 设计目标分布并构建可微分损失，使得点相机观测到期望分布；4) 通过梯度下降连续优化camera splats参数；5) 在优化得到的相机布局下进行新视角合成并与FVS比较。

Result: 提出Camera Splatting框架：将每个相机建模为3D高斯（camera splat），在表面附近采样点放置点相机，从这些点观察相机splats的分布，通过可微分地优化相机splats使点相机观察到目标分布，从而实现视角优化。该方法在处理复杂的视见效应（如镜面反射和细小纹理）上优于Farthest View Sampling (FVS)。

Conclusion: Camera Splatting通过将相机建模为可优化的3D高斯并采用点相机监督，实现了更好的视角分布优化，显著提升了对视点相关现象的建模能力，优于基线FVS方法。

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel
view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a
camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D
points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats.
View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the
camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the
point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.
Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views
demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena,
including intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合多尺度注意力特征与单词布局的条件扩散笔画生成方法，以更好地模仿书写风格与控制单词间距，保留时间信息，实验表现优于现有笔画生成方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作在模仿书写风格时忽视了单词间距作为显式特征，且多数方法直接生成图像而缺失时间坐标信息，限制了对于下游任务的适用性。该工作通过显式布局与笔画生成来弥补这些不足。

Method: 方法包括：1) 提取多尺度注意力风格特征用于局部和全局风格表达；2) 将单词布局作为显式条件输入以控制单词间距；3) 采用条件扩散模型在风格与布局条件下生成时间序列形式的笔画坐标；4) 训练与对比实验验证性能。

Result: 该论文提出了一种基于条件扩散模型（conditional diffusion model）的手写笔画生成方法，旨在更好地模仿篆书风格并处理单词间距问题。作者提出多尺度注意力特征（multi-scale attention features）用于捕获局部和全局的书写风格特征；同时显式引入单词布局（word layout）信息以控制单词间距；相比于直接生成图像的方法，本文生成笔画序列以保留时间坐标信息，从而更适合下游任务如书写识别和作者顺序恢复。实验结果表明，该方法在笔画生成任务上优于现有最先进方法，并且在图像生成方面具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过引入多尺度风格嵌入与显式的单词布局指导，并使用条件扩散模型生成笔画，作者实现了更一致的风格模仿和单词间距控制，提升了笔画生成质量并在若干评测中超越现有方法。

Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of
tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In
handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the
sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the
calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word
spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in
inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes
multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These
multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.
Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word
spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional
diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly
generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal
coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our
proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by
calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke
generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed
diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and
is competitive with recent image generation networks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober,Joachim Denzler,Paul Bodesheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 两阶段“外围+注视”框架结合非极大值抑制和选择性注意，有效减少冗余采样并提高细粒度分类性能，且架构简单共享编码器，适用多种数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有部件/局部方法依赖复杂定位网络、像素到样本空间映射难以及样本空间冗余高且难以量化所需部件数的问题，借鉴人类扫视机制在有限计算下捕获关键局部信息。

Method: 两阶段：1) 外围分支提取全局粗特征并生成采样映射；2) 基于采样映射用NMS选取若干注视点，裁切注视补丁并用权重共享的编码器并行编码。然后用上下文化的选择性注意对各注视补丁加权，最后与外围特征融合进行分类。

Result: 提出了一种受人眼扫视启发的两阶段FGVC方法：先提取外围（粗糙）特征生成采样图，再基于非极大值抑制采样若干注视补丁，使用权重共享编码器并用上下文选择性注意对补丁加权后与外围特征融合。方法在多个细粒度和昆虫数据集上取得与SOTA可比且优于基线编码器的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟人类视覺的粗略-注视流程，使用NMS避免空间冗余并通过上下文选择性注意融合多布点信息，从而在多个细粒度分类基准和昆虫数据集上提升或接近SOTA表现，同时保持相对简单的结构。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

TL;DR: 提出SceneForge：用多物体、有空间关系的合成场景+LLM生成的描述，作为对比学习增强数据，显著提升零样本分类、少样本分割、3D VQA和检索性能，且对不同编码器通用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D-文本数据规模受限且多为单体，难以覆盖真实世界复杂场景。通过合成具有组合性和空间关系的多物体场景，可以丰富语义与几何多样性，提升模型的对齐泛化与空间推理能力。

Method: 利用单体3D形状拼装成多物体场景（显式空间关系），并用大型语言模型生成或精炼多物体描述；将这些样本与原有单体对齐样本混合用于对比学习训练；系统性调整对象数量、批内比例及构建策略以优化效果。

Result: SceneForge通过构建多物体场景并配对连贯的文本描述，增强了3D点云与文本之间的对比学习对齐，从而改善在小规模3D-文本数据下的表现。

Conclusion: 通过结构化的复合样本扩增，对比学习模型在多项3D任务上均获得稳定提升，并展现出更好的空间推理和复杂场景检索能力。

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive
learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive
alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object
scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct
multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent
multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting
contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge
effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets,
significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically
investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per
scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene
construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge
delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including
zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet,
as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's
compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving
performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge
improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to
retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial
reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely
with textual instructions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ORIC基准，通过LLM与CLIP引导采样构造语境不一致的测试场景，评估发现多数LVLM在物体识别上容易误识别和产生幻觉，需加强上下文感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLM在处理图像与语境不一致时容易出错（如物体出现在意外语境或应出现却缺失），导致误识别和幻觉问题。为系统性地测量并分析这一缺陷，作者提出专门的基准。

Method: 提出ORIC基准，结合两种采样策略：1）LLM引导采样：利用大语言模型识别图像中存在但在当前语境下不合适或罕见出现的对象；2）CLIP引导采样：利用CLIP检测图像中可能被模型幻觉出但实际上不存在且与语境相符的潜在对象，从而构造不一致的语境测试集。对18个LVLM和2个开放词汇检测模型进行了评估。

Result: 在ORIC上对18个LVLM和2个开放词汇检测模型的评估显示，模型在不一致语境下表现出明显的识别缺陷，存在大量误识别与幻觉，表明当前模型对上下文敏感性不足。

Conclusion: 该论文构建了一个用于评估大视觉-语言模型（LVLM）在图像语境不一致情况下的识别能力的基准数据集ORIC，揭示了模型在物体误识别与幻觉方面存在显著缺陷，提示需要更多上下文感知的研究。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image
caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and
textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous
contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually
expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification
and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the
Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark
that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate
from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,
which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)
CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are
likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating
18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal
significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual
incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and
encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

*Yuxuan Liang,Xu Li,Xiaolei Chen,Yi Zheng,Haotian Chen,Bin Li,Xiangyang Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Pyramid Token Pruning (PTP)，在不需训练的前提下结合视觉显著性与指令引导对高分辨率图像进行层次化token剪枝，显著降低计算与延迟且性能损失小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs处理高分辨率图像时，分割成子图会急剧增加视觉token数量，导致推理开销成倍增长；因此需要一种高效、无需训练的方法来剪除冗余token以加速推理并保持性能。

Method: PTP首先进行自下而上的区域级显著性检测以确定重要区域，从这些区域进一步进行token级显著性评分，再结合文本指令对token重要性进行加权筛选，最终只保留高重要性token供LVLM推理，无需额外训练。

Result: PTP提出了一种训练-free的多层次token剪枝策略，通过自下而上的视觉显著性（区域+token）和自上而下的指令引导重要性相结合，减少高分辨率图像的视觉token数量以降低LVLMs推理开销。

Conclusion: PTP可在多任务和13个基准上实现显著推理加速与计算节省，同时保持模型性能几乎不变，适合在高分辨率图像场景下部署LVLMs。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal
understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution
images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple
sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing
exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token
Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and
token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human
visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually
salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens
most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Motivation: 云相剖面对辐射传输与降水过程有直接影响，精确的3D云相剖面对数值天气预报和云微物理参数化的改进至关重要，因此需要从高时空分辨率的多模态卫星观测中检索详细云相结构。

Method: 构建同步的高分辨率卫星影像与雷达/激光剖面配对数据集，定义监督学习任务；采用SGMAGNet并与UNet变体、SegNet等多尺度空间网络比较，使用Precision/Recall/F1/IoU等分类指标评估模型。

Result: 建立了一个用于将多模态卫星影像（高时空分辨率的可见光与热红外）映射到三维云相剖面（由CALIOP/CALIPSO和CPR/CloudSat提供）的一对一监督数据集，并基于SGMAGNet提出基线框架。

Conclusion: SGMAGNet在本任务上显著优于UNet/SegNet等基线，能更准确地重建复杂多层和边界过渡区域的云相剖面，有望用于运用到NWP云微物理参数化改进中。

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as
they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this
study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming
multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures,
aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration
with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal
observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band
visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,
and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar
(CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of
synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a
supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D
cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with
several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all
designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is
evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior
performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer
and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision
of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617,
significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic
methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are
inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of
AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
\textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six
medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We
also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage
\textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language
feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI
comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for
extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during
training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts
detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods
and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical
modalities.

### [60] [TrueMoE: Dual-Routing Mixture of Discriminative Experts for Synthetic Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15741)
*Laixin Zhang,Shuaibo Li,Wei Ma,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrueMoE用双路由的多判别专家阵列替代单一判别空间，通过按流形与粒度组织的子空间和自适应路由机制，显著提升合成图像检测的泛化性与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一的判别空间复杂且脆弱，难以泛化到未知生成模式；因此希望通过多专家分工来捕捉多样化伪造线索，提高泛化能力。

Method: 提出TrueMoE框架，核心是沿流形结构和感知粒度两个互补轴组织的判别专家阵列(DEA)，以及双路由机制（粒度感知稀疏路由器与流形感知稠密路由器），用于自适应分配输入到最相关专家；在专家间协同得到最终判别结果。

Result: 在多种生成模型上的大规模实验显示，TrueMoE在泛化性和鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TrueMoE通过将合成图像检测任务分解为多个轻量级、专门化判别子空间的协作推理，实现了比单一统一判别空间更强的泛化和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an
increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a
single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content.
However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling
to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE,
a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that
reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple
specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is
a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of
manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to
be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a
granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively
assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across
a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior
generalization and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由自然图像变换导致的真实场景中图像结构变化，使早期视觉层的感受野响应受形变强烈影响，从而通过扩展感受野形状来应对这些变异。

Method: 基于协变感受野族，结合半群与Lie群思想推导无穷小关系，并证明通过小支撑增量滤波器的级联可以从细尺度响应构造粗尺度响应，形成带方向偏好的Lie代数式结构。

Result: The paper analyzes how receptive field responses change under variations in shape parameters due to geometric image transformations, proposing covariant receptive field families and deriving both infinitesimal (Lie-like) relationships and macroscopic cascade smoothing properties to relate responses across scales and parameter values.

Conclusion: 推导的微分与级联关系有助于理解不同参数下的感受野响应，为高效计算方案设计与生物视觉简单细胞理论建模提供理论基础。

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

Motivation: 现有几何方法和基于Mask R-CNN的深度学习方法在噪声、泛化性和几何细节保持上存在不足，故提出结合点云密度图与通用分割模型以提高重建鲁棒性与精度。

Method: 基于栅格的过滤、可变分辨率投影和图像增强生成顶部视图密度图，利用SAM的零样本能力进行房间分割；使用自适应提示点与多阶段过滤生成房间掩码，结合掩码与点云分析提取并正则化轮廓。

Conclusion: FloorSAM通过将点云密度图与SAM模型结合，实现了鲁棒且精确的楼层平面图重建，能够在噪声和复杂布局下保持较高的准确率和召回率。

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor
navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric
algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,
limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a
framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using
grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we
create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for
precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.
Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,
followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and
regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room
topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better
accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy
and complex settings. Code and materials: github.com/Silentbarber/FloorSAM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对自我视角视频进行人类foveation和cortical magnification仿真，并用于训练时间驱动的生物启发自监督模型，可改善物体表征，原因在于物体感知尺度变大和中心-周边信息的更优平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有以儿童视觉体验为训练数据的自监督模型忽视了人类视野中心高分辨率、周边低分辨率的特点——这一生理特征可能影响物体语义表征的形成。

Method: 使用两套自我视角（egocentric）视频数据，应用人类中心凹（foveation）与皮层放大（cortical magnification）模型对帧进行变换，使周边区域分辨率降低；用这些处理后的视频序列训练两种基于时间的生物启发自监督模型。

Result: 在这种仿真视网膜处理下训练的模型，其学到的物体表征质量提高。分析显示，提升的原因包括：使物体在视野中“显得更大”，以及在中心与周边信息之间产生更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 模拟人类视网膜的会聚视（foveated vision）可以提升自监督学习模型在对物体语义表征上的表现。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic
object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of
toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with
high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we
investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object
representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the
visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models
of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that
the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting
sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models
that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling
aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object
representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement
comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between
central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step
towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more
realistic and performant.

TL;DR: 提出首个多光谱伪装目标检测数据集MCOD，包含高质量逐像素标注和多种挑战属性；评测显示多光谱能显著改善检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD数据集仅限RGB，使得利用多光谱丰富光谱信息增强前景-背景区分的研究受限，亟需一个专门为多光谱COD设计的挑战性基准。

Method: 构建MCOD数据集，收集多光谱图像，标注逐像素目标掩码与挑战属性，并在其上对11种代表性COD方法进行评测，对比单光谱和多光谱模态的性能。

Result: 在MCOD上，所有评测模型性能普遍下降，表明任务难度更高；但引入多光谱模态后性能明显回升，验证了光谱信息对COD稳健性的贡献。

Conclusion: MCOD填补了多光谱伪装目标检测（COD）数据集的空白，为研究提供了更具挑战性和现实性的基准。实验显示多光谱模态明显提升了检测稳健性。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend
seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their
performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral
imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative
for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD
benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for
multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address
this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset
specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD
features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It
captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme
lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world
scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better
reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:
Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding
challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on
MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.
Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this
degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing
detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for
future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized
sampling, biodiversity assessment, long-term monitoring and remote, large-scale
surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in
size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The
integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists,
helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To
evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new
test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million
individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models
pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled)
multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant
species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label
training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data,
the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants
and the results achieved.

Motivation: 提出在SDS基础上引入VLM以解决语义对齐粗糙和空间一致性差的问题

Method: 将Qwen2.5-VL嵌入SDS管线作为可微分语义+空间引导器，替换或补充CLIP式文本编码与2D扩散评分，并在多视角渲染监督下进行3D模型训练

Result: VLM3D框架，基于Qwen2.5-VL，将VLM作为可微分的语义与空间先验，显著提升文本到3D生成的语义保真、几何一致性与空间正确性

Conclusion: VLM3D通过整合VLM到SDS管线，解决了细粒度语义捕捉和多物体场景空间关系问题，并在GPTeval3D上优于现有方法

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation
by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,
using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt
and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two
fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads
to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)
2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in
geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object
scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D
generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into
the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard
text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded
supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their
inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which
significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves
relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the
open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.
Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D
significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,
geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

TL;DR: SCOPE integrates SAM2 encoder into Cutie plus motion prediction and ensemble with original models, improving temporal stability and representation, achieving 3rd place in challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combine strengths of Cutie (query-based segmentation) and SAM2 (pretrained ViT encoder with rich representations) to improve VOS by addressing feature capacity and temporal modeling limits.

Method: Replace Cutie encoder with SAM2 ViT encoder; add motion prediction module for temporal stability; ensemble Cutie, SAM2, and modified model (SCOPE).

Result: Proposed framework replaces Cutie's encoder with SAM2's ViT encoder and adds a motion prediction module; ensemble of Cutie, SAM2, and variant (SCOPE) achieves 3rd place in MOSEv2 track of 7th LSVOS Challenge.

Conclusion: Enriched ViT features and motion prediction enhance robustness in video object segmentation; ensemble further boosts performance.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications
such as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong
query-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a
pretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal
modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their
complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder
of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We
further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant,
achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to
our final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This
demonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion
prediction for robust video object segmentation. The code is available at

TL;DR: SegReg通过分割驱动的区域自适应正则化，把配准问题拆成分区域配准，显著提升临床解剖对齐精度并将配准性能依赖转化为分割质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的图像配准方法通常使用全局统一的平滑正则化，无法有效处理解剖结构区域间差异明显的局部变形需求。作者希望通过分割引导、区域自适应的正则化策略来提高配准精度。

Method: 输入动图与定图先做解剖分割，按分割得到的子区域裁剪或掩膜处理后送入同一配准网络骨干分别估计局部位移场，随后用融合策略（未在摘要详细说明）将局部位移合成为全局变形场；实验在三个临床数据集上比较了使用真值/自动分割下的结果并评估了分割质量对配准精度的影响。

Result: 提出SegReg框架：先对动图与定图进行解剖分割，将图像拆分为多个解剖子区域；对每个子区域用同一配准骨干网络独立估计局部位移场；将局部位移场融合为全局变形场。使用真值分割时在关键结构上达98.23% Dice，在心脏、腹部和肺部三个临床配准场景中（即使使用自动分割）优于现有方法2–12%。研究还发现配准精度与分割质量近线性相关。源码将在论文接收后公开。

Conclusion: SegReg有效利用解剖分割实现区域自适应正则化，提升了配准精度并将配准问题简化为分割精度问题，适用于多种临床场景且对自动分割具有稳健性。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle
diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional
approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform
smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying
deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,
we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements
anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation
patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into
anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains
are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized
partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global
deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%
Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms
existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios
(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our
SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on
segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a
segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript
acceptance.

Motivation: 在边缘设备上的连续学习中，冻结预训练模型并使用提示方法虽然能缓解灾难性遗忘，但导致模型对新知识学习能力下降（可塑性损失），需设计低成本方法恢复参数的更新活力。

Method: 提出Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network(CBPNet)，包含Efficient CBP Block，用于检测并自适应重初始化在训练中未被充分更新的参数以恢复学习活力。仅训练小于0.2%骨干网络规模的额外参数。

Result: 在Split CIFAR-100上相比强基线平均准确率提高超过1%；在挑战性更大的Split ImageNet-R上达到SOTA准确率69.41%，且额外训练参数小于骨干网络的0.2%。

Conclusion: CBPNet通过在冻结的大型预训练模型上附加轻量级可训练参数并对未充分利用的参数进行自适应重初始化，成功缓解了因提示方法导致的可塑性损失问题，从而在边缘设备的连续学习场景中实现性能提升。

Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that
require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual
learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention.
In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a
mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach
introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's
ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the
limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in
plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters
during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual
Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient
framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively
integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by
adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results
on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong
baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of
the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional
parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating
our approach.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change
detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD
datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and
a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully
support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current
approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a
post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further
improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new
benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the
dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more
fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved
roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)
method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and
backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model
collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its
ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal
interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction
Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the
model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,
JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive
results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,
and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available

TL;DR: 提出MS-UDG，通过InfoNCE保证语义充分性，并用解耦损失和重构机制促进最小性，从信息论角度证明能降低OOD风险，在无标签情况下达成UDG SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是当前无监督学习（如SSL）在跨域泛化能力研究不足，UDG任务需在无标签情况下分辨语义与变式，但现有方法依赖域标签，现实中常缺失域标签，因此需要一种无需类别或域标签、能学习对语义保持充分但去除无关变式表示的方法。

Method: 方法上，MS-UDG先用InfoNCE目标保证表示的充分性；为促进最小性，引入了语义-变式解耦损失（semantic-variation disentanglement loss）以及基于重构的机制用于捕捉充足的变式信息；整体通过联合训练实现最小充分语义表示学习。

Result: 理论上证明通过优化充分性和最小性可直接降低OOD风险；实证上，MS-UDG在流行的无监督域泛化基准上，优于现有SSL和UDG方法，达成新的SOTA，且训练过程中不使用类别或域标签。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了将无监督域泛化（UDG）形式化为学习最小充分语义表示（Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation），并提出了MS-UDG方法，通过信息论角度证明了充分性和最小性可以降低分布外风险。实验证明在无类别和无域标签情况下，MS-UDG在UDG基准上取得了SOTA。

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in
supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed
to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised
learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the
challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.
Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,
such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,
we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a
Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves
all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)
maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We
theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information
theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency
and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we
implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a
learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve
sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel
semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism
for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new
state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,
consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or
domain labels during representation learning.

*Tianyang Wang,Xi Xiao,Gaofei Chen,Hanzhang Chi,Qi Zhang,Guo Cheng,Yingrui Ji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TASAM augments frozen SAM with terrain-aware, temporal, and multi-scale modules to improve remote sensing segmentation, delivering strong gains on multiple benchmarks with little extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM fails on remote sensing due to complex terrain, multi-scale objects, temporal dynamics; need domain-adaptive augmentation to leverage foundation models for geospatial segmentation.

Method: Method: Introduce TASAM by adding three modules to SAM: terrain-aware adapter injecting elevation priors; temporal prompt generator capturing land-cover changes; multi-scale fusion enhancing fine-grained delineation. Keep SAM backbone frozen; lightweight modules; minimal compute overhead.

Result: Substantial performance gains on LoveDA, iSAID, WHU-CD benchmarks; outperforms zero-shot SAM and task-specific models while keeping computational overhead minimal.

Conclusion: Domain-adaptive, lightweight modules can effectively adapt foundation models like SAM to remote sensing tasks without retraining the backbone, offering a scalable route to robust geospatial segmentation.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to
generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex
terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we
introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed
specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM
integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter
that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures
land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances
fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our
approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing
benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and
task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight
the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a
scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频理解中处理每帧计算量大与均匀采样难以捕捉语义关键帧的问题

Method: 可微分三阶段关键帧选择、Temporal Apex Distillation（变异评分+拐点检测+优先蒸馏）和KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization（对比学习+显著性奖励）

Result: 提出ChronoForge-RL框架，包含可微分关键帧选择、TAD与KF-GRPO模块，在VideoMME和LVBench数据集上分别达到69.1%与52.7%，并使7B模型性能接近72B模型

Conclusion: ChronoForge-RL通过三阶段关键帧选择、优先蒸馏与显著性增强的奖励，实现了在较小模型上达到大型模型相当的效果

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with
two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing
every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying
semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In
this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called
ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and
KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these
issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism
that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage
process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal
information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective
temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection
detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.
Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm
with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models
to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our
proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench
compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while
enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B
parameter alternatives.

TL;DR: CIDER是一个无模型依赖的推理时提示修正框架，通过检测品牌并用VLM生成风格不同的替代描述来减少T2I模型的品牌偏向，使用BNS评估，实验表明可显著降低品牌出现且不损害图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到T2I模型在处理通用提示时倾向于生成包含显著商业品牌的内容（品牌偏向），这会带来伦理和法律风险，需要一种无需昂贵重训练即可在推理端缓解该偏向的实用方案。

Method: CIDER在不需重训练的情况下运行：首先用轻量级品牌检测器识别生成内容或提示中的品牌实体；然后调用VLM（视觉-语言模型）为被识别的品牌生成风格上差异化的替代描述，替换或扩展原始提示；推理过程中使用这些经修正的提示生成图像。引入Brand Neutrality Score（BNS）用于量化品牌中和效果，并在多种主流T2I模型上进行实验评估。

Result: 在多款主流T2I模型上的大量实验显示：CIDER显著减少了显性（直接品牌标识）和隐性（风格/配色暗示品牌）品牌偏向，同时在图像质量和审美上保持较高水平；BNS提供了可量化的评估指标。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了CIDER，一种在推理时通过提示词优化减少文本到图像模型品牌偏向的框架；通过检测器识别品牌并用视觉-语言模型生成风格上不同的替代提示，实现降低品牌出现概率，同时保持图像质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand
bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands
from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a
novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through
prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector
to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score
(BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I
models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit
biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a
practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the
development of trustworthy generative AI.

Motivation: 现有不确定性估计方法依赖复杂的辅助模型或高级训练手段，难以在领域任务（如cryo-ET）中训练与推广，作者希望通过知识迁移简化不确定性估计流程并提高适用性。

Method: 在每个主动学习循环中，同时训练教师（任务模型）与学生（任务无关的辅助模型），以两模型输出之间的某种距离作为未标注样本的不确定性度量；学生不依赖特殊训练技巧，易于推广。

Result: 在经典计算机视觉任务和cryo-ET挑战上进行大量实验，结果显示该方法在有效性与效率上均有提升，验证了提出方法的实用性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于知识迁移的主动学习不确定性估计方法，通过教师-学生模型同时训练并用两模型输出距离评估未标注样本不确定性，从而避免复杂辅助模型和特殊训练方式，适用于领域任务如cryo-ET分类。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing
methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to
estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and
hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron
Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost
uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode
where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model
that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL
cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure
uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not
rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method
suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data
uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to
the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the
proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The
results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

TL;DR: LC-SLab结合输入/输出级对象聚合与预训练特征，解决稀疏监督下的碎片化问题，在Sentinel-2+LUCAS设置下提升了地图连贯性并保持或超越像元级准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源实地调查数据为训练大规模土地覆盖模型提供可扩展标注来源，但因空间稀疏性导致现有深度学习方法预测碎片化、噪声多；面向对象的分类可通过最低制图单元约束提高地图连贯性，却在深度学习管线中未被充分探索，尤其是中分辨率影像与稀疏监督场景。

Method: 提出LC-SLab框架，支持输入级聚合（基于图神经网络对对象/分割单元进行特征聚合）和输出级聚合（对语义分割模型输出进行后处理），并引入大规模预训练网络的特征来提升小样本性能；在Sentinel-2年复合影像与稀疏LUCAS标签上进行系统评估。

Result: 在不同数据规模下的实验表明：面向对象的方法在连贯性上明显优于像元级模型，且在准确率上可匹配或超越；输入级（GNN）聚合在样本较少时更稳健，输出级聚合在样本充足时表现更佳；多种配置优于现有土地覆盖产品。

Conclusion: 本论文提出的LC-SLab框架有效缓解了稀疏监督下像元级方法易产生碎片化预测的问题，通过面向对象的聚合策略在准确率与连贯性之间实现良好权衡。

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical
role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets
from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual
annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage
often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep
learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address
this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically
coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a
minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain
underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially
in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address
this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for
systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale
land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both
input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation
by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.
Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to
improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual
Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our
results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of
common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.
Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas
output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations
of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the
framework's practical utility.

Motivation: Summarize why this paper is necessary and what problems it addresses.

Method: Please analyze the method used in this paper and its core techniques.

Result: Summarize the main empirical outcomes and claims.

Conclusion: Provide a short conclusion about the paper's significance and future work directions.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text
prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However,
existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to
handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require
larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose
\underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel
zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D
retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding
clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D
annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual
grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid
foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in

Motivation: Develop a lightweight, promptable universal 3D medical image segmentation model that trains fast and performs well with limited data and compute.

Method: U-Net-style architecture combining SegResNet encoder, prompt encoder, mask decoder, latent cross-attention, relative positional encoding, normalized attention; trained from scratch with Muon optimizer on multimodal datasets (<5,000 volumes).

Result: ENSAM trained from scratch on <5,000 volumes in 6 hours on a single 32GB GPU, achieving competitive metrics (final DSC 0.627, NSD 0.597), outperforming two baselines and matching a third in CVPR 2025 challenge; ranks 5th in coreset track and best among non-pretrained methods.

Conclusion: Relative positional encodings and Muon optimizer significantly speed convergence and improve segmentation; ENSAM is an effective, compute-efficient option for universal 3D medical segmentation without pretraining.

Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a
lightweight and promptable model for universal 3D medical image segmentation.
ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder
in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative
positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training.
ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and
computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from
multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB
GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D
Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set
with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of
2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously
published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol),
surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three
metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall
and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation
studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon
optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation
quality.

TL;DR: 提出CrossI2P，一种自监督的跨模态（图像到点云）配准框架，结合双路径对比学习和粗到细注册策略，通过语义-几何融合嵌入、超点-超像素对应和几何约束细化，在KITTI和nuScenes上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决图像（纹理丰富但深度模糊）与点云（稀疏但度量精确）之间的语义-几何鸿沟，以及现有方法易陷入局部最优的问题，进而实现鲁棒的跨模态配准。

Method: 方法包括：1) 双路径对比学习构建几何-语义融合嵌入空间，实现图像与点云双向对齐；2) 粗到细两阶段配准：全局阶段建立超点-超像素对应，结合模态内上下文和跨模态交互；局部阶段基于几何约束进行点级细化；3) 动态训练机制，使用梯度归一化平衡特征对齐、对应精化和位姿估计的损失。

Result: 在KITTI Odometry上比SOTA提高23.7%，在nuScenes上提高37.9%，在准确性和鲁棒性上显著提升。

Conclusion: CrossI2P在无标注条件下实现了稳健的2D-3D配准，通过融合语义与几何特征、两阶段配准流程和动态损失平衡，显著提升了配准精度和鲁棒性，实验在KITTI和nuScenes上取得大幅领先。

Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in
autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains
challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but
depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well
as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that
unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end
pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via
dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional
alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine
registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel
correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction
modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise
registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient
normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence
refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry
benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and
robustness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RACap enhances retrieval-augmented captioning by modeling fine-grained structured relations and heterogeneous objects, improving captions with a lightweight 10.8M-parameter model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented image captioning methods inadequately model relationships: semantic prompts are too coarse and image-object/semantic relations are not explicitly modeled. RACap aims to address these gaps.

Method: RACap retrieves structured relation features from captions and detects heterogeneous objects in images to integrate relational semantics into caption generation, emphasizing fine-grained relation modeling.

Result: RACap mines structured relation semantics from retrieved captions and identifies heterogeneous image objects, retrieving structured relation features to improve semantic consistency and relational expressiveness. It achieves superior performance with only 10.8M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: RACap effectively captures structured relation semantics and heterogeneous object information from retrieval captions and images, boosting caption quality and relational expressiveness with a compact model.

Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external
knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes.
However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the
representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture
fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image
objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we
propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning,
which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but
also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively
retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual
information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.
Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters,
achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning
models.

Conclusion: 作者提出将视觉基础模型（SAM2）适配到LiDAR范围视图分割，指出其在速度、可扩展性和部署方面的优势，并在SemanticKITTI上达到有竞争力的结果，证明VFMs可作为3D感知通用主干的可行性。

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene
understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research
due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular
memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view
methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic
segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the
rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot
recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current
state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for
LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our
knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,
coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard
projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for
range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to
the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies
inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to
the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism
in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial
patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach
achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the
speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This
work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D
perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR
segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods
using VFMs leads to promising results.

TL;DR: GREAT adds spatial, epipolar matching, and volume attention to provide global context and geometric detail for iterative stereo, improving performance in occluded/textureless/repetitive regions; SOTA results when applied to IGEV-Stereo


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: iterative stereo methods lack global context and geometric cues, causing poor performance in ill-posed regions; propose framework to add global context and geometric info

Method: Design three attention modules: Spatial Attention (global spatial context), Matching Attention (global context along epipolar lines), Volume Attention (integrates SA and MA to excite cost volume); integrate into existing iterative pipelines and validate extensively

Result: GREAT framework with three attention modules (SA, MA, VA) improves cost-volume and iterative refinement; integrated into various methods (GREAT-Stereo) and achieves top benchmarks: GREAT-IGEV ranks first on Scene Flow, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, second on Middlebury

Conclusion: Incorporating global spatial and epipolar attention with volume excitation substantially enhances iterative stereo matching, yielding SOTA results across multiple benchmarks

Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like
RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed
regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of
global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To
enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we
propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)
framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial
Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension,
Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and
Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more
robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify
the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into
several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it
through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This
framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.
Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first
on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves
second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统前馈神经网络为静态结构，缺乏生物系统中广泛存在的反馈与动态迭代决策机制；引入反馈动力学可提高模型对噪声的鲁棒性和小样本泛化能力。

Method: 将反馈过程建模为微分方程，并用一个带指数衰减项以确保收敛的循环神经网络来求解；在分类与分割任务中与前馈基线比较，并在噪声和有限样本条件下评估性能，同时在医学影像数据上测试鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示在噪声较大或训练数据有限的场景下，DFMs比等效前馈网络表现更好；在目标识别、分割及医学影像任务中均获得改进，并且对多种噪声类型具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 引入反馈动力学的DFMs在稳定性、抗噪声能力和有限数据下的泛化性能上均优于传统前馈模型，适用于视觉任务与医学影像场景。

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that
combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This
feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures,
enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of
biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation
solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to
ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two
key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In
both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform
their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes.
In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust
against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the
importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning.

Result: 在标准基准测试上，该方法在视角稠密时与最先进方法竞争，在视角稀疏时性能明显优于对应方法，确立了一个强有力的基线。

Conclusion: 本文提出一种无训练的开放词汇3D目标检测方法，能在稀疏视角下仅用少量带位姿的RGB图像输入，利用2D预训练基模型提升性能，在稠密视角下与现有最先进方法相当，在稀疏视角下显著优越。

Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many
vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object
detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to
a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has
traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories,
which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object
detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a
limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is
training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models
instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring
3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D
proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the
extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard
benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful
baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely
sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view
setting.

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar
fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and
lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to
find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new
architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as
accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and
radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of
radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is
introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A
self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between
the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the
FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures
with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this
modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object
detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50,
while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset
for the same category.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化使产量预测更加复杂，现有依赖时空数据的方法难以有效利用多光谱信息。为提升预测精度并给农户提供决策支持，作者提出融合多光谱与时空特征并通过对比学习增强表示能力的模型。

Method: 方法包括：1) 利用对比学习进行预训练以学习判别性空间-光谱表示；2) 设计多时序多光谱融合网络以同时捕捉时序依赖与光谱相关性；3) 在多传感器数据上进行端到端训练并用MAPE等指标评估与基线对比。

Conclusion: MTMS-YieldNet通过对比学习预训练和时空-光谱联合建模，解决了多光谱数据处理困难，从而在不同传感器数据上实现更准确的产量预测，对农业管理具有实用价值。

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and
food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by
affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm
management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in
overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data
analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal
data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral
data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To
resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield
Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with
spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and
dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained
models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive
learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing
spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing
data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of
the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.
MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,
and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield
prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The
outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and
provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,
potentially improving crop yields.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究可解释性方法在单目深度估计（MDE）网络上的适用性，比较了Saliency Maps、Integrated Gradients与Attention Rollout在轻量级（METER）与深度（PixelFormer）模型上的表现，并提出新的评估指标Attribution Fidelity来衡量解释性可信度。实验表明Saliency适合轻量模型，Integrated Gradients适合深度模型，Attribution Fidelity能发现传统指标漏判的不可靠解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MDE在现实应用中广泛部署，但对其决策过程的可解释性研究较少；现有解释方法和评估指标可能不足以保证在MDE任务上的有效性和可信度，因此需要系统性分析并提出更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 采用三种特征归因方法（Saliency Maps、Integrated Gradients、Attention Rollout）在两类MDE模型（METER和PixelFormer）上生成视觉解释；通过对被标记为重要/不重要的像素施加选择性扰动，观察输出深度图变化；并引入Attribution Fidelity指标，评估归因与预测深度图的一致性。

Result: 实验显示：Saliency Maps在轻量级METER上表现最佳，Integrated Gradients在深度PixelFormer上更稳健；Attention Rollout总体效果较差；Attribution Fidelity能检测出传统评价（如插入/删除类指标）误判的情况，提供更可靠的解释质量判别。

Conclusion: Saliency Maps和Integrated Gradients在各自适配的MDE模型上能有效定位重要输入特征；Attention Rollout表现较差；新提出的Attribution Fidelity能更可靠地判别解释性方法的有效性，补足现有评估指标的不足。

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand
the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable
results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving.
However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain
limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight
framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This
framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and
Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode
attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs
early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road
infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.
The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among
historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich
the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors
is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments
show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq
dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory
prediction in V2X scenarios.

TL;DR: 该文提出在单目自监督深度估计中，用像素级深度混合分布建模多峰深度，从回归不确定性转移到混合权重，结合方差感知损失和不确定性传播，在KITTI和VKITTIv2上显著提升边界锐度和点云质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计在物体边界处常模糊，产生错误的中间深度点；精细边界通常需密集监督，作者希望在自监督场景下也能得到清晰不连续深度。

Method: 对每个像素预测多个深度成分与对应权重，形成混合分布；使用方差感知的重投影损失与不确定性传播模块，将预测不确定性从深度值本身转移到权重；可无缝集成到现有自监督深度估计框架中。

Result: 在KITTI与VKITTIv2上进行大量评估，边界锐度提升最多35%，点云质量也较最先进方法有所改善。

Conclusion: 通过将每像素深度视作混合分布并设计方差感知损失与不确定性传播，方法在无需额外精细监督下，显著提高了边界锐利度（最高35%）和点云质量，优于现有自监督基线。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding,
but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing
spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires
very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities
using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a
mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting
uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation
integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions
and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show
that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point
cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a
Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual
Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two
critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name
results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual
diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual
appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework
that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category
disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic
prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to
adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive
experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently
enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for
language-guided continual learning.

Conclusion: DistillMatch有效结合VFM的通用语义特征与模态专属信息，通过知识蒸馏和生成式数据增强提升了跨模态匹配准确性和泛化能力

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of
different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis.
However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this
task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets,
existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for
matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision
Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and
robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities,
including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal
image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch
employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that
extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to
assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it
extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's
features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.
Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by
translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation.
Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public
datasets.

Motivation: real-world multi-view data often only partially aligned; view-consistency assumption breaks causing performance drop; treat partial alignment as intervention

Method: causal variational auto-encoder with contrastive regularizer

Result: proposed CauMVC showing strong generalization and effectiveness on fully and partially aligned data; uses encoder to estimate invariant features, decoder for post-intervention inference, contrastive regularizer to capture correlations

Conclusion: CauMVC有效解决了从完全对齐到部分对齐导致的性能下降问题，是首个将因果学习应用于广义多视图聚类的工作，实验证明在不同对齐程度数据上均表现优越。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure
across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption
of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across
different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often
present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across
different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,
we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order
shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view
clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view
clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to
understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the
partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with
partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining
invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational
Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing
information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed
to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive
regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal
learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data
illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of
recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR
over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world
visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and
pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local
Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon
two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between
visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content
facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech
mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain
local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues
for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path
feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features
within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the
model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding
acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a
coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a
Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features
with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,
refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our
framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive
learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual
challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3
benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced
challenging Mandarin dataset.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动重建依赖点法线或固定数量控制点，导致在噪声点云或复杂几何时表现欠佳；B样条对平滑性友好，但需要自适应的控制点数量与位置来匹配表面复杂度，因此提出无需法线且能预测可变控制点的字典引导GCN方法。

Method: 利用字典学习（存储典型控制点模式）与图卷积网络结合，输入点云构建图结构，GCN从字典中选择并组合基元以恢复可变数量的控制点，然后用B样条拟合生成连续曲面；训练时在无法线监督下以重建误差和正则化（如平滑、稀疏）为目标。

Result: 提出了一种基于字典引导图卷积网络（Dictionary-Guided GCN）的表面重建方法，能从有噪点云中同时预测B样条控制点的位置和数量，生成平滑曲面且不依赖点法线；相较若干基线方法在定性和定量评估上表现更优。

Conclusion: 所提方法能在无需点法线的情况下，从嘈杂点云中自适应地预测控制点数量与位置，生成更平滑且精确的B样条曲面，优于多种基线。

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a
fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are
inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing
data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth
normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency
makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the
availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the
case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface
representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening
properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using
B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline
control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of
a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very
difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we
develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface
reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and
the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth
surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction
method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing
widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all
of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 现有GAD方法依赖视觉特征的隐式模式学习，缺乏上下文推理与可解释性。作者希望利用MLLM的常识推理能力弥补视觉模型在语义推理和解释性方面的不足。

Method: 在MLLM词汇表中新增<ACT>与多个<GROUP>令牌，输入视频帧、这两个令牌及语言指令到MLLM，利用MLLM预训练知识让令牌学习语义表示；设计多标签分类损失提升<ACT>判别能力；提出MDAF模块将令牌的隐藏嵌入与视觉特征双向对齐融合用于最终预测。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种将多模态大语言模型（MLLM）用于GAD的新框架LIR-GAD，通过引入活动级<ACT>令牌和簇级<GROUP>令牌，并结合多标签损失与双对齐融合模块，利用MLLM的常识和语义能力增强群体活动检测的可解释性与性能。

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members
and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing
deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,
transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic
dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on
implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual
reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel
framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by
introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>
tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and
language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained
commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>
tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities
and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.
Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the
<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,
we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates
MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual
features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in GAD taks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE&TREK 是一种训练与 GPU 免费的提示框架，通过语义丰富的关键帧采样与运动轨迹重建，提升纯视觉条件下 MLLMs 的空间推理能力，实验显示最多可提升 3.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补现有工作在仅靠视觉输入时对空间推理能力提升不足的空白，避免依赖深度或点云等额外模态。

Method: 提出了两个无训练提示策略：最大语义丰富度采样（使用现成感知模型从视频中选取关键帧）和运动重建（模拟视觉轨迹并将相对空间位置编码到关键帧），仅需单次前向推理即可集成到现有 MLLMs。

Result: 在 VSI-BENCH 和 STI-BENCH 基准上，SEE&TREK 为多种 MLLMs 带来稳定提升，最高可达约 3.5% 的性能增益。

Conclusion: SEE&TREK 能在纯视觉条件下显著提升 MLLMs 的空间理解能力，但缺乏训练与硬件成本的情况下验证其泛化性与对不同模型的适配性仍需更多评估。

Abstract: We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored
to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated
modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely
visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap
by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion
reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness
Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract
semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion
reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial
positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal
coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward
pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive
experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently
boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with
the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial
intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出BSGD：双分支（盲点引导 + 常规模型）扩散自监督去噪，在保持细节的同时学习噪声结构，SIDD/DND上达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统盲点网络由于空间独立性假设导致的局部细节丢失与像素不连续性，以及将扩散模型用于自监督去噪时训练困难的问题，提升真实噪声去除性能。

Method: 构建双分支扩散结构：一条基于盲点网络的扩散分支生成半干净图像，另一条为常规模型分支建模噪声分布；利用盲点分支在采样阶段引导常规模型，使其在无配对数据下学习噪声结构同时保留局部细节。

Result: 在SIDD和DND数据集上取得了最先进的结果，证明该自监督方法在真实世界去噪任务中高度有效。

Conclusion: 该文提出了一种名为Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion（BSGD）的自监督真实图像去噪框架，通过双分支扩散模型融合盲点网络与常规模型的优势，有效解决了BSN破坏局部细节和扩散模型自监督训练困难的问题。

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised
framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major
challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often
sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial
independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to
self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that
combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a
conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To
enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to
guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local
details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective
self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AdaSports-Traj，一种用于多智能体体育场景的自适应轨迹预测框架，通过角色-域感知适配器调整潜在表示，并引入分层对比学习分别监督角色敏感和域感知表示，解决角色结构异质性和跨域分布差异问题，在篮球、足球和足球数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体体育轨迹预测面临角色间结构异质性（球员与球）与不同体育项目间的分布差异，统一框架难以兼顾这些差异，导致泛化性差。需要一种显式建模角色与域差异的自适应方法以提升跨角色与跨域性能。

Method: 在编码器后接入Role- and Domain-Aware Adapter，根据智能体身份（如球员或球）和运动域信息条件性调整潜在表示；同时设计Hierarchical Contrastive Learning，分层施加对比损失，分别约束角色敏感表示与域感知表示，从而鼓励表示解耦，避免优化冲突。

Result: 在Basketball-U、Football-U与Soccer-U三套数据集上的实验表明，AdaSports-Traj在统一和跨域预测设置中都取得了显著性能提升，证明其适配器与分层对比学习设计的有效性。

Conclusion: AdaSports-Traj通过融合Role- and Domain-Aware Adapter与Hierarchical Contrastive Learning，有效缓解了角色内外的分布差异，提高了统一模型在多运动域与跨域轨迹预测的泛化能力并在三个数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently
challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g.,
players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports
domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured
distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and
domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework
that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution
discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and
Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on
agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical
Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and
domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures
without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports
datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and
cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

TL;DR: SegDINO3D通过将2D预训练检测模型的图像级和物体级特征引入3D Transformer 编码器-解码器（以3D盒子作为查询并与2D物体查询做跨注意力），显著提升3D实例分割性能，尤其在ScanNet200上大幅优于先前方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用2D预训练检测模型的丰富表征来提升3D实例分割性能，弥补3D训练数据不足的问题。

Method: 输入点云与对应多视角二维图像；在编码器中为每个3D点检索对应视图的2D图像特征并进行3D上下文融合；在解码器中以3D锚盒构造查询，并对2D检测模型产生的2D物体查询执行跨注意力，利用预测盒信息调制注意力以精确查询。

Result: 提出SegDINO3D框架，将2D图像的图像级和物体级特征引入3D分割，通过3D点云与2D图像联合输入、点级2D特征检索、3D编码器融合，以及以3D盒子查询对2D物体查询进行跨注意力交互，取得ScanNetV2和ScanNet200上的SOTA，ScanNet200上验证集和隐藏测试集分别提升+8.7和+6.8 mAP。

Conclusion: 将2D物体级表示与3D盒子查询结合的跨模态注意力机制能有效迁移2D预训练知识到3D任务，从而显著提升实例分割在小样本3D数据集上的表现。

Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder
framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as
sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D
representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both
image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.
SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In
the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image
features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for
3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D
anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries
obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries
serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively
avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory
while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The
introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate
cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D
instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200
dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP
on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its
superiority.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RadarGaussianDet3D：用PGE+3DGS生成稠密BEV特征，用BGL做一致性框优化，同时实现低延迟推理，提升精度并满足车载实时性要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有4D雷达3D检测器依赖pillar编码导致BEV稀疏、框属性独立优化带来次优检测，同时在车载嵌入式设备上推理速度不足，需一种既稠密有效又低延迟的方法。

Method: 设计了Point Gaussian Encoder(PGE)将每个雷达点聚合特征后表示为高斯原语，利用3D Gaussian Splatting将点渲染到BEV栅格以生成稠密特征图；提出Box Gaussian Loss(BGL)，将边界框转为3D高斯分布并通过分布距离进行联合优化；算法在点特征聚合和3DGS渲染上做了低延迟优化，兼顾精度与速度。

Result: 在TJ4DRadSet与View-of-Delft数据集上，RadarGaussianDet3D在检测精度上达到或超过现有最先进水平，并在推理速度上有显著加速，证明了其适用于实时自动驾驶场景。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于高斯原语和分布的高效3D雷达检测器RadarGaussianDet3D，通过点高斯编码器(PGE)与3D高斯点溅(3DGS)实现更稠密的BEV特征图，并用盒高斯损失(BGL)对目标框进行一致性优化，显著提升检测精度与推理速度，适合车载实时部署。

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving
due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement
capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on
pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to
only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded
representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes
independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their
inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the
real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these
limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely
RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and
distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding
boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed
to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and
employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,
yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to
the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of
3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts
bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to
enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on
TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves
state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster
inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous
driving.

Motivation: 随着多模态大模型发展，将其与人类偏好对齐变得关键，但缺乏系统性的MRM构建指南，促使作者通过实验研究填补这一空白并提供可复现的最佳实践。

Conclusion: 该论文通过大规模实验系统性总结了构建高性能多模态奖励模型（MRM）的有效“配方”，并提出了BaseReward基线模型，在多个基准上取得新的SOTA，并在真实RLHF流程中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made
aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs)
are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for
building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking
in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this
paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance
MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM
development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,
Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head
architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering
over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model}
and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a
powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward
adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,
featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully
curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our
results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as
MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,
outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility
beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world
reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance
across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not
only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with
a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the
next generation of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Use time-resolved photon counts from low-res ToF sensors plus learned priors and differentiable rendering to recover object pose and simple scene geometry from very sparse measurements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recover geometry of 3D parametric scenes using minimal depth measurements from low-cost time-of-flight sensors.

Method: Collect time-resolved photon counts from distributed low-res ToF pixels, use feed-forward network to predict scene parameters, then refine via differentiable rendering/analysis-by-synthesis; validate with simulations and hardware captures.

Result: Method combining feed-forward prediction and differentiable rendering within analysis-by-synthesis recovers 6D object pose from as few as ~15 pixels; validated in simulation and real prototypes; explores limits of approach.

Conclusion: Feasible to recover 6D pose of known untextured objects and some other parametric scenes using sparse ToF data with their hybrid prediction+refinement pipeline; practical via prototypes, with limitations explored.

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth
measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.
These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but
image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data
in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes
rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse
measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few
measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple
parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a
known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both
feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering
within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter
estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method
effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both
simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial
results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to
explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

Motivation: 文本到图像模型难以精准呈现以动作与交互为核心的复杂场景，原因在于训练语料未完整覆盖动作相关的隐含属性与上下文依赖，需构建专门基准并寻找方法改善。

Method: 构建AcT2I基准进行系统评估，发现主流T2I模型表现较差；提出利用大语言模型进行训练-free知识蒸馏，对原始文本提示进行扩充，加入三类稠密信息（包括时间/顺序信息）以增强动作语义的表达；在多个T2I模型上验证提示增强的效果。

Result: 在AcT2I基准上，增强后的提示显著提升生成质量，时间信息注入带来最大改进，最佳模型在相关评测上提升达72%，证明了系统化整合语言知识对复杂动作呈现的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了AcT2I基准，指出现有T2I模型在生成动作中心图像时表现欠佳，并提出一种基于大语言模型的训练无关知识蒸馏方法，通过在提示中注入三维稠密信息（尤其是时间细节）显著提升生成准确性，最高提升达72%。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in
generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist
in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the
primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models
frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent
in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual
details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from
action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do
not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises
from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual
dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this
by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large
Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by
incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that
injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation
accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings
highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that
require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge
in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and
contextually accurate images.

TL;DR: MLLMs对图像输入更容易“谄媚”用户误导性指令。直接监督微调会减少谄媚但增加顽固性。SRT通过促使模型先反思指令真伪后再回答，有效降低视觉谄媚而不引起过度顽固。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到MLLM在图像输入场景中比文本模型更易发生迎合用户错误或误导指令的行为（视觉谄媚差距），需要探索原因并设计方法减少这种有害行为。

Method: 先尝试有监督微调以抵抗误导指令，发现导致对纠正指令的顽固性；提出SRT，通过训练模型进行反思性推理以判断指令是否误导，再决定采纳或拒绝，从而减少谄媚且不过于顽固。

Result: MLLMs在处理图像输入时表现出更严重的“谄媚式”行为（视觉谄媚差距），即过度迎合用户误导性指令。作者分析了导致该差距扩大的因素，并尝试用有监督微调来抵抗误导性指令，但发现会导致模型对纠正性指令过于顽固。为解决此权衡，提出了Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT)，使模型在给出回答前进行反思推理，以判断指令是否误导，从而在减少谄媚行为的同时避免过度顽固。

Conclusion: SRT能显著降低MLLM对误导性指令的谄媚行为，同时保持对纠正性指令的响应灵活性，缓解直接监督微调带来的权衡。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary
capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we
observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.
While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models
(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image
inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To
better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to
the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we
first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist
misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also
makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even
if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective
Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,
allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or
corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a
significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,
without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective
instructions.

TL;DR: 用张量分解在无需重训练的前提下对视觉编码器表示进行分解重建，过滤对抗噪声，从而提高VLM（如CLIP）在COCO和Flickr30K上的鲁棒性，最佳设置为Tensor Train低秩(8-32)与低残差(α=0.1-0.2)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法通常需要昂贵的重训练或架构改动，需一种轻量、可直接运用于预训练VLM的防御手段以提高对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 对视觉编码器的表示施行张量分解（如Tensor Train），保留低秩分量并添加小幅残差重建，过滤掉对抗噪声；在不同秩和残差强度下搜索最优配置（推荐秩8-32，α=0.1-0.2）。

Result: Introduces a lightweight, retraining-free defense for VLMs using tensor decomposition to denoise vision encoder representations, improving robustness against adversarial attacks on CLIP evaluated on COCO and Flickr30K.

Conclusion: 张量分解重建是一种实用且轻量的即插即用防御方法，能在不改动模型和不重训练的情况下部分恢复被对抗攻击损失的性能，对CLIP在Flickr30K和COCO上分别恢复12.3%和8.1%的Recall@1。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone
to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or
significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using
tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.
By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters
adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and
Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\%
performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On
COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%.
Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual
strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,
plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination
models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model
subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified
modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical
self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges
representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,
feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the
hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the
intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for
missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant
contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among
incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight
reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual
semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid
consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality
combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and
whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under
diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D
semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be
released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.

*Sai Varun Kodathala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用二分法利用类间方差单峰性，把Otsu阈值搜索从线性降到对数，显著减少计算量且基本保持分割精度，适合实时与大规模图像处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于解决Otsu算法在大灰度范围或实时/大规模图像处理场景下的计算瓶颈，通过算法加速保持分割质量以满足实时性和资源受限环境的需求。

Method: 方法是将常规在所有灰度值上穷举搜索的步骤替换为基于二分法的迭代查找，利用类间方差（between-class variance）的单峰特性进行区间收缩并在对数级别的迭代中定位最优阈值。

Result: 在48张标准测试图像上的实验显示，与传统穷举搜索相比，方差计算减少约91.63%，算法迭代次数减少约97.21%。二分法在66.67%的样本上得到精确阈值，95.83%的样本偏差小于5灰度级，且收敛性满足理论对数界且具确定性性能保证。

Conclusion: 该论文提出将二分法用于Otsu阈值算法，通过利用类间方差函数的单峰性质，在不损失分割精度的前提下显著降低计算复杂度，实现从O(L)到O(log L)的复杂度优化。

Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image
segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by
exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work
presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to
exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.
Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)
evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on
48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance
computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to
conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold
matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5
gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical
logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees
suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical
computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without
compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the
original Otsu method.

TL;DR: Manzano uses a hybrid image tokenizer and unified training to enable one LLM to both understand and generate images, achieving strong results and minimal task conflict


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: reduce trade-off between visual understanding and generation in unified multimodal LLMs

Method: Hybrid tokenizer + unified training

Result: state-of-the-art among unified models; competitive with specialist models on text-rich tasks

Conclusion: hybrid tokenizer and joint training scale well, validating design for unified multimodal capabilities

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and
generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source
models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We
present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially
reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated
training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters
that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete
tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified
autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image
tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image
tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe
over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both
capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,
and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich
evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from
scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process discovery algorithms that linearize events fail to capture real concurrency; partial-order handling techniques lack scalability. Need a scalable method that leverages partial orders directly to produce accurate, compact models.

Method: 从事件数据中派生局部有序的追踪（部分有序追踪），通过分层聚合策略逐步合成流程模型，系统性地识别并保留并发结构，同时抽象独占选择和循环模式，确保构建的模型是sound-by-construction并与日志完全拟合。

Result: A hierarchical algorithm that derives partially ordered traces and aggregates them into a sound-by-construction, perfectly fitting process model; it preserves concurrency and abstracts choices and loops, demonstrated on complex real-life logs.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了对并发行为更忠实的流程表示，并在可扩展性上优于现有部分有序方法，适合在并发性强的事件数据上使用。

Abstract: Process discovery algorithms traditionally linearize events, failing to
capture the inherent concurrency of real-world processes. While some techniques
can handle partially ordered data, they often struggle with scalability on
large event logs. We introduce a novel, scalable algorithm that directly
leverages partial orders in process discovery. Our approach derives partially
ordered traces from event data and aggregates them into a
sound-by-construction, perfectly fitting process model. Our hierarchical
algorithm preserves inherent concurrency while systematically abstracting
exclusive choices and loop patterns, enhancing model compactness and precision.
We have implemented our technique and demonstrated its applicability on complex
real-life event logs. Our work contributes a scalable solution for a more
faithful representation of process behavior, especially when concurrency is
prevalent in event data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 满足时延敏感的机器学习在线服务需求（例如欺诈检测、推荐、时序预测），将离线与在线特征计算集成并提高实时查询性能。

Method: 使用特征丰富的合成数据在Docker环境下评估，通过改进查询计划、缓存执行计划、并行处理和资源管理来优化SQL+ML查询，分析各项优化贡献比重（查询计划35%、缓存25%、并行20%）。

Result: 实验报告OpenMLDB可支持约12500 QPS且延迟<1ms，性能分别比SparkSQL/ClickHouse高23倍，比PostgreSQL/MySQL高3.57倍；各优化手段对性能提升的贡献被量化。

Conclusion: OpenMLDB在实时特征计算与服务场景表现优异，优化框架显著提升吞吐与延迟，适合时敏ML应用；但结果受合成实验与部署设置限制，需要更多公开、可复现评估。

Abstract: In this study, we optimize SQL+ML queries on top of OpenMLDB, an open-source
database that seamlessly integrates offline and online feature computations.
The work used feature-rich synthetic dataset experiments in Docker, which acted
like production environments that processed 100 to 500 records per batch and 6
to 12 requests per batch in parallel. Efforts have been concentrated in the
areas of better query plans, cached execution plans, parallel processing, and
resource management. The experimental results show that OpenMLDB can support
approximately 12,500 QPS with less than 1 ms latency, outperforming SparkSQL
and ClickHouse by a factor of 23 and PostgreSQL and MySQL by 3.57 times. This
study assessed the impact of optimization and showed that query plan
optimization accounted for 35% of the performance gains, caching for 25%, and
parallel processing for 20%. These results illustrate OpenMLDB's capability for
time-sensitive ML use cases, such as fraud detection, personalized
recommendation, and time series forecasting. The system's modular optimization
framework, which combines batch and stream processing without interference,
contributes to its significant performance gain over traditional database
systems, particularly in applications that require real-time feature
computation and serving. This study contributes to the understanding and design
of high-performance SQL+ML systems and highlights the need for specialized SQL
optimization for ML workloads.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种不需预设minutil的top-k周期性高效用模式挖掘算法TPU，支持负效用，通过PNUL和PEUCS结构及三种阈值提升策略提高效率，实验表明在时间和空间上均有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在挖掘周期性高效用模式(PHUPM)中难以预先设定最小效用阈值(minutil)以及用户只关心部分模式的问题，提供一种无需事先设定minutil且能够处理正负效用的top-k周期性高效用模式提取算法。

Method: 设计PNUL和PEUCS数据结构记录必要信息；采用PIU、PCUD、PRU三种策略动态提升阈值以减少候选；基于这些结构和策略进行深度优先搜索以提取top-k周期性高效用模式。

Result: 提出TPU算法，使用正负效用列表(PNUL)和周期估计效用共现结构(PEUCS)存储项集信息，并引入PIU、PCUD和PRU三种阈值提升策略，显著缩短运行时间并降低内存消耗，在多个包含负效用的数据集上取得最佳性能。

Conclusion: TPU算法能准确有效地提取带或不带负效用的top-k周期性高效用模式，并通过三种阈值提升策略加速挖掘过程，解决了minutil难以设定的问题，对数据科学有贡献。

Abstract: With a user-specified minimum utility threshold (minutil), periodic
high-utility pattern mining (PHUPM) aims to identify high-utility patterns that
occur periodically in a transaction database. A pattern is deemed periodic if
its period aligns with the periodicity constraint set by the user. However,
users may not be interested in all periodic high-utility patterns (PHUPs).
Moreover, setting minutil in advance is also a challenging issue. To address
these issues, our research introduces an algorithm called TPU for extracting
the most significant top-k periodic and high-utility patterns that may or may
not include negative utility values. This TPU algorithm utilizes positive and
negative utility lists (PNUL) and period-estimated utility co-occurrence
structure (PEUCS) to store pertinent itemset information. It incorporates the
periodic real item utility (PIU), periodic co-occurrence utility descending
(PCUD), and periodic real utility (PRU) threshold-raising strategies to elevate
the thresholds rapidly. By using the proposed threshold-raising strategies, the
runtime was reduced by approximately 5\% on the datasets used in the
experiments. Specifically, the runtime was reduced by up to 50\% on the
mushroom\_negative and kosarak\_negative datasets, and by up to 10\% on the
chess\_negative dataset. Memory consumption was reduced by about 2\%, with the
largest reduction of about 30\% observed on the mushroom\_negative dataset.
Through extensive experiments, we have demonstrated that our algorithm can
accurately and effectively extract the top-k periodic high-utility patterns.
This paper successfully addresses the top-k mining issue and contributes to
data science.

Abstract: With the advent of big data, periodic pattern mining has demonstrated
significant value in real-world applications, including smart home systems,
healthcare systems, and the medical field. However, advances in network
technology have enabled malicious actors to extract sensitive information from
publicly available datasets, posing significant threats to data providers and,
in severe cases, hindering societal development. To mitigate such risks,
privacy-preserving utility mining (PPUM) has been proposed. However, PPUM is
unsuitable for addressing privacy concerns in periodic information mining. To
address this issue, we innovatively extend the existing PPUM framework and
propose two algorithms, Maximum sensitive Utility-MAximum maxPer item (MU-MAP)
and Maximum sensitive Utility-MInimum maxPer item (MU-MIP). These algorithms
aim to hide sensitive periodic high-utility itemsets while generating sanitized
datasets. To enhance the efficiency of the algorithms, we designed two novel
data structures: the Sensitive Itemset List (SISL) and the Sensitive Item List
(SIL), which store essential information about sensitive itemsets and their
constituent items. Moreover, several performance metrics were employed to
evaluate the performance of our algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art
PPUM algorithms. The experimental results show that our proposed algorithms
achieve an Artificial Cost (AC) value of 0 on all datasets when hiding
sensitive itemsets. In contrast, the traditional PPUM algorithm yields non-zero
AC. This indicates that our algorithms can successfully hide sensitive periodic
itemsets without introducing misleading patterns, whereas the PPUM algorithm
generates additional itemsets that may interfere with user decision-making.
Moreover, the results also reveal that our algorithms maintain Database Utility
Similarity (DUS) of over 90\% after the sensitive itemsets are hidden.
