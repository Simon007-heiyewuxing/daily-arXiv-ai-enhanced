However, in real-world scenarios, databases probably face numerous adverse events. Quantifying the ability to cope with these events from a comprehensive perspective remains an open problem. We provide the definition of database resilience to describe its performance when facing adversity and propose ResBench, a benchmark for evaluating database resilience. This framework achieves automation, standardization, and visualization of the testing process through clear hierarchical decoupling. ResBench simulates adverse events and injects them during normal transaction processing, utilizing a module to gather multiple metrics for the evaluation model. We assess database resilience across eight dimensions: throughput, latency, stability, resistance, recovery, disturbance period, adaptation capability and metric deviation. All the results are presented to users via a user-friendly graphical interface. We demonstrate the execution process and result interpretation of ResBench using two types of adversity datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "ResBench: automated benchmark to evaluate database resilience under injected adverse events across 8 metrics with visualization", "motivation": "Existing benchmarks ignore adverse events; need to quantify DB resilience comprehensively", "method": "Propose ResBench benchmark based on resilience definition", "result": "ResBench framework automates simulation/injection of adverse events, collects metrics, evaluates across 8 dimensions, provides GUI visualization", "conclusion": "ResBench enables standardized, automated, visual evaluation of database resilience using simulated adversity datasets"}}

However, a critical gap exists in the current way GDB-GML applications analyze data, especially in terms of Knowledge Completion (KC) in Knowledge Graphs (KGs). In particular, current architectures ignore KC, working on datasets that appear incomplete or fragmented, despite they actually contain valuable hidden knowledge. This limitation may cause wrong interpretations when these data are used as input for GML models.\n  This paper proposes an innovative architecture that integrates a KC phase into GDB-GML applications, demonstrating how revealing hidden knowledge can heavily impact datasets' behavior and metrics. For this purpose, we introduce scalable transitive relationships, which are links that propagate information over the network and modelled by a decay function, allowing a deterministic knowledge flows across multiple nodes.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that our intuition radically reshapes both topology and overall dataset dynamics, underscoring the need for this new GDB-GML architecture to produce better models and unlock the full potential of graph-based data analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728GDB-GML\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8870\u51cf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u9012\u5173\u7cfb\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b8c\u5907\uff0c\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u9690\u85cf\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06KC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dGDB-GML\u67b6\u6784\u5ffd\u89c6\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b8c\u5907\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u7247\u6bb5\u5316\u7684KG\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3aGML\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u9020\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u6a21\u578b.", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728GDB-GML\u7ba1\u9053\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u5173\u7cfb\uff08transitive relationships\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8870\u51cf\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u4f20\u64ad\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6210\u9690\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f71\u54cd.", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0eKC\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u8457\u91cd\u5851\u6570\u636e\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u6574\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027.", "conclusion": "\u5f15\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u5b8c\u5907\uff08KC\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u5e93-\u56fe\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff08GDB-GML\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6570\u636e\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807."}}

This paper asks a precise, testable version of the \"runaway growth\" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts.

Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x.

Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "ColoWorkflow\u901a\u8fc7Delphi\u5171\u8bc6\u5f62\u6210\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c6\u9891\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4e2d\u7b49\u81f3\u826f\u597d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u5fae\u521b\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57f9\u8bad\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u548cAI\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u521b\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u624b\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u6d41\u7a0b\u53d8\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u9661\u5ced\u4e0e\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u540e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u57f9\u8bad\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u624b\u672f\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5de5\u5177\u96be\u4ee5\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e0e\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528Delphi\u5171\u8bc6\u6cd5\u5236\u5b9a\u901a\u7528\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u5f62\u621010\u4e2a\u624b\u672f\u9636\u6bb5\u548c34\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff1b\u636e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1ColoWorkflow\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba9\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u5bf9\u6765\u81ea5\u4e2a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u300154\u4e2a\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u8179\u8154\u955c\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u95f4\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08Cohen's K\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u8fbe\u6210\u5bf910\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u548c34\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\uff1b\u572854\u4e2a\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u96641\u4e2a\u6807\u7b7e\u5916\u5168\u90e8\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u95f4\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e3a\u9636\u6bb5\u5e73\u5747Cohen's K=0.71\uff0c\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e73\u5747K=0.66\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5206\u6b67\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u6362\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fb9\u754c\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ColoWorkflow\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5fae\u521b\u7ed3\u76f4\u80a0\u624b\u672f\u7684\u5171\u8bc6\u9a71\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u4e2d\u7b49\u4ee5\u4e0a\u8bc4\u5206\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8de8\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0eAI\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains.

Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters.

However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance.

Accepted for publication in the Journal of Information Systems Engineering and Management", "summary": "Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement. These results indicate that YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed compared to YOLOv11. To further validate its reliability, comparative experiments were conducted against other high-performance object detection models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10.

Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs).

Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector.

This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset.

However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.", "AI": {"tldr": "HCD\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5206\u89e3\u5171\u4eablogits\uff0c\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u5408\u5e76\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u5206\u79bb\u5b50logits\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f20\u9012\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfKD\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u540c\u6784\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406ViT\u5230ResNet\u7b49\u5f02\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5f02\u6784KD\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56logit\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHCD\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6c60\u5316\u5904\u7406\u5b66\u751f\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u62fc\u63a5\uff0c\u7ecfCFM\uff08\u5168\u8fde\u63a5\u5c42\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eablogits\uff1b\u5f15\u5165SDD\u5c06\u5171\u4eablogits\u5212\u5206\u4e3an\u4e2a\u5b50logits\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08logits\u878d\u5408\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u6821\u6b63\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6b63\u4ea4\u635f\u5931\u7ea6\u675f\u5b50logits\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u4f20\u9012\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u3001CUB200\u548cImageNet-1K\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aHCD\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684KD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784KD\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "HCD\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5171\u4eablogits\u4e0a\u878d\u5408\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5b50logits\u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u84b8\u998f\u4e2d\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment.

To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues.

Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks.

A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context.

Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an \"Eigenbasis Score\", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations.

While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.", "AI": {"tldr": "DMC decouples vision encoder and text prompt training to preserve cross-modal alignment; DMC-OT uses optimal transport to align stored Gaussian replay statistics when the encoder evolves, yielding SOTA CIL performance for CLIP-based models", "motivation": "Prevent catastrophic forgetting and classifier bias when learning new class soft prompts without prior data by using one modality as stable anchor and calibrating memory statistics across evolving encoders", "method": "Two-stage decoupled adaptation with modality freezing", "result": "Proposed DMC and DMC-OT; DMC decouples encoder adaptation and prompt optimization with alternating frozen training; DMC-OT adds optimal-transport guided calibration for memory statistics and task-specific prompting; both achieve SOTA on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, CUB-200, UCF-101, with DMC-OT improving accuracy by ~1.80%", "conclusion": "Decoupling modalities and calibrating memory via optimal transport effectively mitigate bias and distribution drift in CLIP-based class-incremental learning, improving accuracy and maintaining cross-modal alignment"}}

We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling.

We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality.

This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression.

To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCLUE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u533b\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u683c\u5f0fprompt\u548c\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eStable Diffusion\uff0c\u52a0\u5165Style Encoder\u548cU-Net\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0eprompt\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u4e2d\u8033\u708e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347FID\u3001recall\u548c\u5206\u7c7bF1\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u7b49\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u79cd\u7c7b\u5c11\u3001\u6570\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21prompt-image\u6570\u636e\u6216\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eStable Diffusion\uff0cCLUE\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2aStyle Encoder\uff0c\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u56fa\u5b9a\u683c\u5f0fprompt\u7f16\u7801\u4e3astyle embedding\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u6ce8\u5165U-Net\u7684\u65b0\u589e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u533a\u57df\u5185\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u542bFID\u3001recall\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7bF1\uff0c\u4e14\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u8033\u708e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aCLUE\u5c06FID\u4ece46.81\u964d\u52309.30\uff0crecall\u4ece49.60%\u5347\u523070.29%\uff1b\u75281000%\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5408\u6210-only\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668F1\u4e3a83.21%\uff08\u5bf9\u6bd473.83%\uff09\uff0c\u4e0e\u7b49\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3F1\u4e3a94.76%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u5408\u6210only\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "CLUE\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u9886\u57df\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u4f4eFID\u3001\u9ad8recall\uff09\u5e76\u7528\u4f5c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684F1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPROMISE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u53ca\u63d0\u793a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u4e00\u81f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u8bae\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "PROMISE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u5b8c\u6574\u4e0e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u7f3a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u793a"}}

Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faEmoVid\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u5728Wan2.1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u6761\u4ef6\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u521b\u610f\u5a92\u4f53\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fa7\u91cd\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\u867d\u6709\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u793e\u533a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u521b\u610f/\u975e\u5199\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u5361\u901a\u52a8\u753b\u3001\u7535\u5f71\u7247\u6bb5\u548c\u52a8\u56fe\u8d34\u7eb8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08EmoVid\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u4eae\u5ea6\u3001\u8272\u5f69\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u3001\u8272\u76f8\uff09\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5b57\u5e55\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u6790\u5bf9Wan2.1\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u60c5\u611f\u6761\u4ef6\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u611f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff08text-to-video \u548c image-to-video\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728EmoVid\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u60c5\u611f\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u548c\u4e3b\u89c2\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u7b7e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u663e\u8457\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1bEmoVid\u6210\u4e3a\u60c5\u611f\u89c6\u9891\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "EmoVid\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u521b\u610f\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u89c6\u9891\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u60c5\u611f\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u6761\u4ef6\u878d\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \\textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology.

This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts.

Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes.

Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control.

Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5EmbryoDiff\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u7126\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u4ee5\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u5f15\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u80da\u80ce\u5206\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5355\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u5373\u8fbe82.8%\u548c81.3%\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u9ad8IVF\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u5206\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u5224\u522b\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u5229\u7528\u53d1\u80b2\u5206\u5e03\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u7126\u5e73\u9762\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1) \u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u51bb\u7ed3\u5e27\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u7126\u5e73\u9762\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7126\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efa3D\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u4e49-\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ebf\u7d22\u6ce8\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u53bb\u566a\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faEmbryoDiff\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u5e8f\u5217\u53bb\u566a\u5b8c\u6210\u5206\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u51bb\u7ed3\u5e27\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u7126\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7126\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u6784\u5efa3D\u611f\u77e5\u5f62\u6001\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u8bed\u4e49-\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u7ebf\u7d22\u6ce8\u5165\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0c\u5355\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u4e0b\u5206\u522b\u8fbe82.8%\u548c81.3%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u7126\u70b93D\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u53bb\u566a\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u80da\u80ce\u53d1\u80b2\u5206\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u6297\u906e\u6321\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff08\u5355\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\uff09\u3002"}}

Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data.

However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.", "AI": {"tldr": "HGC\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5757\u95f4\u7528\u5757\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u8df3\u8fc7\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u5757\u5185\u90e8\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u5728COCO-Stuff\u4e0a\u5c06MACs\u4ece18.22T\u964d\u81f36.70T\uff08-63%\uff09\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931<1.5%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u517c\u987e\u63a7\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\uff1a1\uff09\u5757\u7ea7\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u6309\u5757\u8df3\u8fc7\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u95f4\u7684\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u76f8\u90bb\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5c06\u4e24\u8005\u65e0\u7f1d\u5d4c\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5404\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u7c92\u5ea6\u7f13\u5b58\uff08HGC\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u5757\u7ea7\uff08\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u7ea7\uff08\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\uff09\u7f13\u5b58\u6765\u590d\u7528\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "HGC\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eMACs\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u6781\u5c0f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u63a7\u5408\u6210\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps.

However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty.

However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks.

However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes.

Supplementary material included after references. 27 pages, 21 figures, 11 tables", "summary": "4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy.

However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faNP-LoRA\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7SVD\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u5c06\u4e3b\u9898LoRA\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u98ce\u683cLoRA\u7684\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08\u542b\u8f6f\u6295\u5f71\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514dLoRA\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6743\u91cd\u5408\u5e76\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u5e38\u88ab\u67d0\u4e00LoRA\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9LoRA\u6743\u91cd\u505aSVD\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u98ce\u683c\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u4e3b\u9898LoRA\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u98ce\u683cLoRA\u7684\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e14\u5f15\u5165\u8f6f\u6295\u5f71\u63a7\u5236\u4e3b\u9898\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08DINO\u3001CLIP\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u4e0eLLM\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cNP-LoRA\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u878d\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u4e3b\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0eLoRA\u5bf9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u53d1\u73b0LoRA\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u91cd\u53e0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u4fdd\u6301\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u6b63\u4ea4\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u878d\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images.

Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+\u03b4$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality.

To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \\textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \\textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \\textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \\textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \\textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52Transformer\u57283D\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u603b\u4f53\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u542b3D\uff09\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u91c7\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u914d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u8bc6\uff1b\u90e8\u52063D\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5168\u70b9\u4e91/\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06DDPM\uff08\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56e0\u679cTransformer\u9002\u914d\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f62\u72b6\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u8865\u5168\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u4e0e\u5224\u522b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u53ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u566a\u58f0\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u597d\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0b\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4e0e\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08continuous latents\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ece\u5355\u4e2a\u566a\u58f0\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5224\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff1b\u4f46\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks.

For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets.

However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels.

The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection.

In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation.

Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation.

Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction.

It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.", "AI": {"tldr": "OT-ALD uses optimal transport to map source latents to target latents, removing mismatch, speeding up sampling, and improving FID over baselines.", "motivation": "DDIB links two diffusion models for I2I but suffers from low efficiency and trajectory deviations due to latent mismatches.", "method": "Compute optimal transport map from source latent distribution to target latent distribution and use mapped distribution as start for reverse diffusion; retain cycle consistency.", "result": "20.29% improved sampling efficiency and average FID reduced by 2.6 across four tasks on three datasets.", "conclusion": "OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatch and improves both efficiency and quality in DDIB-based I2I translation."}}

Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u611f\u6765\u81ea\u58f0\u5b66\u6df7\u54cd\u66f2\u7ebf\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u201c\u6df7\u54cd\u53d8\u6362\uff08Reverberation\uff09\u201d\u7528\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u663e\u5f0f\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u54cd\u6838\u6a21\u62df\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u884c\u4eba\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u6539\u53d8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u3001\u5904\u7406\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u7b49\uff09\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u56e0\u679c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u54cd\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u4e14\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u54cd\u6838\uff08\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u6ce8\u610f/\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6216\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u884c\u4e3a\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u901a\u8fc7\u5377\u79ef\u6837\u5f0f\u7684\u6df7\u54cd\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u672a\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6838\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u884c\u4eba\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRev\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u5e76\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5206\u6790\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6df7\u54cd\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Rev\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., \"Crack\" vs. \"Scratch\") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category.

To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations.

Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities.

Accepted to Special Track on AI Alignment, AAAI 2026. Project Page- https://refine-align.github.io/", "summary": "In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error.

While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data.

Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning.

A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 \u03bcm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns.

We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains.

We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision.

However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes.

However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry.

We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end.

Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency.

However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e94\u79cd\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u98ce\u683cMixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation\uff08MoE LoRA\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u98ce\u683c\u4e13\u5c5e\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u4e2a\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u5c42\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u4f4e\u79e9\u9636\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22LoRA\u5728Diffusion in Transformer\uff08DiT\uff09\u4e2d\u6700\u4f73\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11LoRA\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9047\u5230\u65b0\u98ce\u683c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u6b20\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u80fd\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u65b0\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u98ce\u683c\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e94\u79cd\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5728DiT\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u63d2\u5165LoRA\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\uff08MoE\uff09LoRA\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u98ce\u683c\u4e13\u5c5e\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5668\u4ee5\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5355\u79e9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u5c42\u6700\u4f73\u79e9\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u4e94\u98ce\u683c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u5c11\u7684LoRA\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u9636\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8def\u7531\u8bbe\u8ba1\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MoE LoRA\u80fd\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u98ce\u683c\u8054\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u683c\u4e13\u5c5e\u4e0e\u5171\u4eab\u8def\u7531\u907f\u514d\u98ce\u683c\u95f4\u5e72\u6270\u5e76\u6355\u6349\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u52a8\u9009\u9636\u63d0\u9ad8\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u6297\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u66f4\u5c11\u3002"}}

This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an \"Embedding-as-Value\" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGEODE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u4e13\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5757DRM\uff09\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u8fde\u7eed\u56de\u5f52\u5934DRH\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u76843D\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u56de\u5f52\u80fd\u529b\uff0c1.5B\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a7B+\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVLM\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u201c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u201d\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563token\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7cbe\u786e\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u503c\u548c\u590d\u67423D\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u89e3\u8026\u8f93\u5165\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5f25\u8865\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u4e3bVLM\u5916\u63a5\u4e24\u4e2a\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) Decoupled Rationale Module\uff08DRM\uff09\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c06\u663e\u5f0f3D\u6570\u636e\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6/\u70b9\u4e91/\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u4e0e2D\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5e76\u84b8\u998f\u7a7a\u95f4\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\uff08CoT\uff09\u903b\u8f91\u4e3a\u53ef\u6ce8\u5165\u7684Rationale Tokens\uff1b2) Direct Regression Head\uff08DRH\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u201cEmbedding-as-Value\u201d\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e13\u7528\u63a7\u5236token\u9001\u5165\u8f7b\u91cfMLP\u4ee5\u56de\u5f52\u8fde\u7eed\u6807\u91cf\u4e0e3D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u4e3b\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4ec51.5B\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u82e5\u5e72\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u59823D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb/\u89d2\u5ea6\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c1.5B\u7684GEODE\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1\u5e73\u88617B+\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u503c\u56de\u5f52\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "GEODE\u901a\u8fc7DRM\u4e0eDRH\u4e24\u6a21\u5757\u8865\u5145\u4e3bVLM\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7a81\u7834\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u74f6\u9888\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6570\u503c\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c0f\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fde\u7eed\u6570\u503c\u548c3D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u7ea7\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Along this line, recent \"Mamba-for-vision\" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior \"vision-mamba\" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline.

This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u76ee\u5149\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u9996\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08AGT\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u793e\u4f1a\u611f\u77e5\u7c97\u7ec6\u4e24\u6bb5\uff08SACF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u793e\u4f1a/\u975e\u793e\u4f1a\u4e24\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u7f13\u89e3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u63d0\u9ad8\u9762\u90e8\u6ce8\u89c6\uff08\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u513f\u7ae5\u7684\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u8054\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u80fd\u652f\u6301\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6216\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u5bb6\u5ead/\u793e\u533a\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u513f\u7ae5\u6ce8\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6AGT\uff1b\u63d0\u51faSACF\u7f51\u7edc\u2014\u2014\u5305\u542b\u793e\u4f1a/\u975e\u793e\u4f1a\u4e24\u6761\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6839\u636e\u573a\u666f\u793e\u4ea4\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u4e24\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7b56\u7565\u5148\u505a\u7c97\u5206\u7c7b\u518d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSACF\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\uff08\u9762\u90e8\u6ce8\u89c6\uff09\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SACF\u6846\u67b6\u5728AGT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9762\u90e8\u6ce8\u89c6\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5229\u7528\u573a\u666f\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u81ea\u95ed\u75c7\u76ee\u5149\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u542b\u5730\u611f\u77e5\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684CountSteer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u64cd\u63a7cross-attention\u9690\u85cf\u6001\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6307\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea64%\u4e14\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u53d7\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u9075\u5faa\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u5173\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u8ba1\u6570\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u53ef\u501f\u6b64\u7ea0\u6b63\u751f\u6210\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCountSteer\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684cross-attention\u9690\u85cf\u6001\u4ee5\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u6307\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCountSteer\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7ea64%\u3002", "conclusion": "CountSteer\u8868\u660e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u786e\u5b9e\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u4e0e\u6570\u76ee\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5bfccross-attention\u9690\u85cf\u6001\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6539\u8fdb\u8ba1\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language.

While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u9891\u57df\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u57df\u8054\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08D-GAP\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u68af\u5ea6\u6784\u5efa\u9891\u7387\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u56fe\u5e76\u5728\u632f\u5e45\u4e0a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u8f85\u4ee5\u50cf\u7d20\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347OOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u7528\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u57df\u5916\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u589e\u5f3a\u9700\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e14\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7eaf\u9891\u57df\u6270\u52a8\u5ffd\u7565\u50cf\u7d20\u7ec6\u8282\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u9891\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u56fe\uff08sensitivity maps\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5728\u6e90\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6837\u672c\u7684\u632f\u5e45\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6270\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6210\u5206\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cD-GAP\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u589e\u5f3a\uff1a\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8+5.3%\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u9ad8+1.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "D-GAP\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9891\u7387\uff08\u632f\u5e45\uff09\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57df\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color.

This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Free3D\u7528ML-RQ\u548c\u4e00\u7ec4\u514d3D\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u5728\u4ec5\u67092D\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u6cdb\u5316\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e3D\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d3D\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cbe\u786e3D\u76d1\u7763\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u5750\u6807\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u653e\u5bbd3D\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6838\u5fc33D\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMotion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE(ML-RQ)\u5c062D\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u6620\u5c04\u52303D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u5957\u514d3D\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff08\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u6574\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75282D\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "Free3D\u5728\u4ec5\u75282D\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u76843D\u52a8\u4f5c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u6bd4\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u51683D\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u514d3D\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFree3D\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u514d3D\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u611f3D\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5b66\u5230\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($\u03bc$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures.

Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u793a\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u57fa\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u77ac\u65f6\u6ce2\u52a8\u7684LSEF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542bSEM\u3001DDM\u3001CIM\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u7528RAO\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VAC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VAC\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u957f\u671f\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\u4e0e\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u8868\u5f81\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u611f\u6ce2\u52a8\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u542b\u4e49\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u539f\u7406\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6LSEF\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\uff08SEM\uff09\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u79e9\u60c5\u611f\u57fa\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u6a21\u5757\uff08DDM\uff09\u5206\u79bb\u7a00\u758f\u77ac\u65f6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08CIM\uff09\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u53cd\u5e94\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u79e9\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\uff08RAO\uff09\u5e73\u8861\u68af\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u4e0e\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86LSEF\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8fa8\u8bc6\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4f4e\u79e9\u7a00\u758f\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LSEF\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u60c5\u611f\u52a8\u6001\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u7684\u957f\u671f\u57fa\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u77ed\u671f\u6ce2\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8fa8\u8bc6\u529b\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u533a\u5206\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace\" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features.

We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher\" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student\" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\\%.

Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems.

However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing.

This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u201d\uff08multimodal iconicity\uff09\uff0c\u628a\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u662f\u5426\u8ba4\u51fa\u53c2\u8003\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08\u5982\u4f55\u63cf\u7ed8\uff0c\u590d\u5236\u6216\u91cd\u91ca\uff09\u5206\u5f00\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u5e76\u57285\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e767\u4e2a\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u5728\u6587\u672c\u88ab\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u4ecd\u590d\u5236\u6807\u5fd7\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u6587\u5316\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u9891\u7387\u3001\u6587\u672c\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u3001\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u548c\u521b\u4f5c\u5e74\u4ee3\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u4fa7\u91cd\u5fd8\u5374\u6216\u590d\u5236\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u4ee5\u4f55\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u518d\u73b0\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u7167\u7684\u533a\u5206\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0a\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0e\u53d8\u6362\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b767\u4e2a\u6765\u81eaWikidata\u7684\u6587\u5316\u53c2\u8003\uff08\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u7c7b\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u57285\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u66ff\u6362\u3001\u5b57\u9762\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9891\u7387\u3001\u6587\u672c\u552f\u4e00\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u53ca\u521b\u4f5c\u5e74\u4ee3\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "Paper introduces concept 'multimodal iconicity' distinguishing recognition vs realization in text-to-image diffusion models; provides evaluation framework and metrics; evaluates 5 diffusion models on 767 Wikidata-derived references; shows framework outperforms similarity methods; finds models reproduce iconic visual structures despite prompt perturbations; cultural alignment correlates with training frequency, textual uniqueness, popularity, creation date.", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u65e2\u5728\u4e8e\u590d\u5236\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u4e5f\u5728\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\u4e0e\u518d\u8bed\u5883\u5316\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u8bed\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u3002"}}

This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduce Hi-DREAM: hierarchical, ROI-based conditioning for diffusion decoders that aligns cortical hierarchy with U-Net scales, improving semantic reconstruction and interpretability.", "motivation": "Mapping fMRI to images currently conditions directly on fMRI without considering cortical hierarchical organization, which may blur roles of different visual areas.", "method": "ROI adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams, builds multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned to U-Net scales; lightweight depth-matched ControlNet injects scale-specific hints during denoising.", "result": "Hi-DREAM groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams, converts them into multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with U-Net depth, and uses depth-matched ControlNet during denoising, achieving SOTA on semantic metrics on NSD while keeping low-level fidelity.", "conclusion": "Structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy yields efficient, interpretable decoders that reveal functional contributions of visual areas and outperform purely data-driven embeddings on high-level metrics."}}

When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use \"visual prompts\" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations.

However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Controlled, annotated synthetic data for fine-tuning reduces biases and boosts real-world absolute position performance", "motivation": "Address biases, annotation errors, and distribution imbalance in real-world fine-tuning by generating controlled synthetic data", "method": "Fine-tuning VLMs with controlled synthetic data", "result": "Balanced synthetic fine-tuning yields uniform scene performance and improved transfer to real-world (COCO), outperforming matched-setting fine-tuning", "conclusion": "Controlled synthetic datasets that comprehensively sample object attributes improve VLM robustness and transferability compared to standard real-world fine-tuning"}}

Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead.

Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability).

However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) the need for large-scale 3D city assets for supervised training, which are difficult and costly to obtain, and (2) reliance on semantic or height maps, which are used exclusively for generating buildings in virtual worlds and lack connection to real-world appearance, limiting the realism and generalizability of generated cities. To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery. Unlike previous city-level generation methods, Sat2RealCity builds generation upon individual building entities, enabling the use of rich priors and pretrained knowledge from 3D object generation while substantially reducing dependence on large-scale 3D city assets.

However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faImAgent\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u81ea\u8bc4\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709T2I\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u7cca\u6216\u6b20\u5b9a\u65f6\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u6cd5\uff08\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u5199\u3001best-of-N\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\u5f80\u5f80\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u4e14\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b56\u7565\u63a7\u5236\u5668(policy controller)\uff0c\u8ba9\u591a\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u591a\u6b21\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u81ea\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u81ea\u8bc4\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cImAgent\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9aa8\u5e72\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8fc7\u5176\u4ed6\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ImAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens.

However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types.

However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move", "AI": {"tldr": "CVChess\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u900f\u89c6\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u5206\u683c\u4e0e\u5e26\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684CNN\u5206\u7c7b\uff0813\u7c7b\uff09\u5c06\u624b\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u4e3aFEN\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8c03\u7528\u68cb\u529b\u5f15\u64ce\u63d0\u4f9b\u843d\u5b50\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f29\u5c0f\u5b9e\u4f53\u68cb\u76d8\u4e0e\u6570\u5b57\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ebf\u4e0b\u68cb\u5c40\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u7ebf\u4e0a\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8fdb\u9636\u5efa\u8bae\u4e0e\u8f85\u52a9\u3002", "method": "\u6d41\u7a0b\u5305\u62ecHough\u76f4\u7ebf\u53d8\u6362\u8fdb\u884c\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u900f\u89c6\u53d8\u6362\u5b9e\u73b0\u4fef\u89c6\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u5206\u5272\u621064\u683c\u5b50\u3001\u7528\u542b\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684CNN\u5bf9\u6bcf\u683c\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a13\u7c7b\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7f16\u7801\u6210FEN\u5e76\u8f93\u5165\u68cb\u529b\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faCVChess\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6b8b\u5dee\u5c42\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ece\u624b\u673a\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u68cb\u76d8\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u68cb\u5b50\u5e76\u751f\u6210FEN\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u53ef\u63a5\u5165\u68cb\u529b\u5f15\u64ce\u7ed9\u51fa\u6700\u4f73\u843d\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eChessReD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6b8b\u5deeCNN\u5728\u591a\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u89d2\u5ea6\u4e0b\u53ef\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bc6\u522b\u68cb\u5b50\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4f9b\u68cb\u5f15\u64ce\u4f7f\u7528\u7684FEN\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5b9e\u4f53\u68cb\u5c40\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u843d\u5b50\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities \"think\". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models.

However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/", "AI": {"tldr": "LARM \u662f\u5c06 LVSM \u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5173\u8282\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u5173\u8282\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u5408\u6210\u5e76\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u5bfc\u51fa\u7f51\u683c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7a20\u5bc6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u6602\u8d35 per-instance \u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u5173\u8282\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e transformer \u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4e0e\u5f62\u6001/\u5173\u8282\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6269\u5c55 LVSM \u7684 NVS \u80fd\u529b\u5230\u5173\u8282\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e0e\u90e8\u4ef6\u63a9\u7801\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u663e\u5f0f\u7f51\u683c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5173\u8282\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7701\u53bb\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\u548c per-instance \u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa LARM\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e transformer \u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u6062\u590d\u8be6\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u5173\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e0e\u90e8\u4ef6\u63a9\u7801\u4ee5\u4fbf\u663e\u5f0f\u7f51\u683c\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5173\u8282\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LARM \u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u7684 3D \u5173\u8282\u5316\u5bf9\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe/\u72b6\u6001\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8d34\u5408\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e SOTA\u3002"}}
