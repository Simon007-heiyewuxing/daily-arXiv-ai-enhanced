STMs simplify atomicity. Recent STMs can achieve good performance for some workloads but they have some limitations. In particular, STMs typically cannot support long-running reads which access a large number of addresses that are frequently updated. Multiversioning is a common approach used to support this type of workload. However, multiversioning is often expensive and can reduce the performance of transactions where versioning is not necessary. In this work we present Multiverse, a new STM that combines the best of both unversioned TM and multiversioning. Multiverse features versioned and unversioned transactions which can execute concurrently. A main goal of Multiverse is to ensure that unversioned transactions achieve performance comparable to the state of the art unversioned STM while still supporting fast versioned transactions needed to enable long running reads. We implement Multiverse and compare it against several STMs. Our experiments demonstrate that Multiverse achieves comparable or better performance for common case workloads where there are no long running reads. For workloads with long running reads and frequent updates Multiverse significantly outperforms existing STMS. In several cases for these workloads the throughput of Multiverse is several orders of magnitude faster than other STMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "TLDR", "motivation": "Summarize motivation", "method": "Summarize method", "result": "Summarize result", "conclusion": "Summarize conclusion"}}

Many resources are created using vocabularies that are FAIR-compliant and well-annotated, yet the collective ecosystem of these resources often fails to interoperate effectively in practice. This continued challenge is mainly due to variation in identifier schemas and data models used in these resources. We have created two tools to bridge the chasm between interoperability in principle and interoperation in practice. Babel solves the problem of multiple identifier schemes by producing a curated set of identifier mappings to create cliques of equivalent identifiers that are exposed through high-performance APIs. ORION solves the problems of multiple data models by ingesting knowledge bases and transforming them into a common, community-managed data model. Here, we describe Babel and ORION and demonstrate their ability to support data interoperation.

Most FD discovery algorithms find all valid dependencies, but this causes two problems. First, the computational cost is prohibitive: computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tuples and exponentially with the number of attributes, making discovery slow on large-scale and high-dimensional data. Second, the result set can be huge, making it hard to identify useful dependencies. We propose SDP (Selective-Discovery-and-Prune), which discovers the top-$k$ FDs ranked by redundancy count. Redundancy count measures how much duplicated information an FD explains and connects directly to storage overhead and update anomalies. SDP uses an upper bound on redundancy to prune the search space. It is proved that this upper bound is monotone: adding attributes refines partitions and thus decreases the bound. Once the bound falls below the top-$k$ threshold, the entire branch can be skipped. We improve SDP with three optimizations: ordering attributes by partition cardinality, using pairwise statistics in a Partition Cardinality Matrix to tighten bounds, and a global scheduler to explore promising branches first. Experiments on over 40 datasets show that SDP is much faster and uses less memory than exhaustive methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSDP\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u754c\u526a\u679d\u548c\u4e09\u9879\u5de5\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u7684top-k FD\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u7a77\u4e3e\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\u66f4\u7701\u5185\u5b58\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfFD\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u8981\u679a\u4e3e\u6240\u6709\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684FD\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u89c4\u6a21\u90fd\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53d1\u73b0top-k\u91cd\u8981FD\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u4ee3\u4ef7\u5e76\u4ea7\u51fa\u66f4\u6709\u7528\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "SDP\u5bf9FD\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5197\u4f59\u4e0a\u754c\u7684\u526a\u679d\uff1b\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u4e0a\u754c\u968f\u5c5e\u6027\u96c6\u589e\u5927\u5355\u8c03\u9012\u51cf\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u9879\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u6309\u5206\u533a\u57fa\u6570\u6392\u5e8f\u5c5e\u6027\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u6210\u5bf9\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5206\u533a\u57fa\u6570\u77e9\u9635\u4ee5\u6536\u7d27\u4e0a\u754c\u3001\u5168\u5c40\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\u9ad8\u6f5c\u529b\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u572840+\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSDP\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u4e8e\u7a77\u4e3e\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u627e\u5230\u6309\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u6570\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u524dk\u4e2aFD\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SDP\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u6570\u7684top-k\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86FD\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7a77\u4e3e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We utilize FGSM to generate adversarial noise targeting an identity classifier and employ a diffusion model with reverse diffusion to enhance imperceptibility through Gaussian smoothing and adaptive brightness correction, thereby facilitating synthetic adversarial patch evasion. The refined patch is applied to facial images to test its ability to evade recognition systems while maintaining natural visual characteristics. A Vision Transformer (ViT)-GPT2 model generates captions to provide a semantic description of a person's identity for adversarial images, supporting forensic interpretation and documentation for identity evasion and recognition attacks. The pipeline evaluates changes in identity classification, captioning results, and vulnerabilities in facial identity verification and expression recognition under adversarial conditions.

Published at Pattern Recognition", "summary": "Accurately localizing 3D objects like pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles is essential in Autonomous Driving. To ensure high detection performance, Autonomous Vehicles complement RGB cameras with LiDAR sensors, but effectively combining these data sources for 3D object detection remains challenging. We propose LCF3D, a novel sensor fusion framework that combines a 2D object detector on RGB images with a 3D object detector on LiDAR point clouds. By leveraging multimodal fusion principles, we compensate for inaccuracies in the LiDAR object detection network. Our solution combines two key principles: (i) late fusion, to reduce LiDAR False Positives by matching LiDAR 3D detections with RGB 2D detections and filtering out unmatched LiDAR detections; and (ii) cascade fusion, to recover missed objects from LiDAR by generating new 3D frustum proposals corresponding to unmatched RGB detections. Experiments show that LCF3D is beneficial for domain generalization, as it turns out to be successful in handling different sensor configurations between training and testing domains. LCF3D achieves significant improvements over LiDAR-based methods, particularly for challenging categories like pedestrians and cyclists in the KITTI dataset, as well as motorcycles and bicycles in nuScenes.

Deep learning has shown strong potential in medical image analysis, particularly for chest X-ray interpretation. This study compares two state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for automated pediatric pneumonia detection. Methods: A publicly available dataset of 5,863 pediatric chest X-ray images was used. Images were preprocessed through normalization, resizing, and data augmentation to enhance generalization. DenseNet121 and EfficientNet-B0 were fine-tuned using pretrained ImageNet weights under identical training settings. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), and recall. Model explainability was incorporated using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to visualize image regions influencing predictions. Results: EfficientNet-B0 outperformed DenseNet121, achieving an accuracy of 84.6%, F1-score of 0.8899, and MCC of 0.6849. DenseNet121 achieved 79.7% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.8597, and MCC of 0.5852. Both models demonstrated high recall values above 0.99, indicating strong sensitivity to pneumonia detection. Grad-CAM and LIME visualizations showed consistent focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the reliability of model decisions. Conclusions: EfficientNet-B0 provided a more balanced and computationally efficient performance compared to DenseNet121, making it a strong candidate for clinical deployment.

We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability.

Retrieval on seen categories ensures precise recognition of known classes, while retrieval on unseen categories promotes generalization to novel classes with limited supervision. However, most existing deep hashing methods are confined to a single training paradigm, either pointwise or pairwise, where the former excels on seen categories and the latter generalizes better to unseen ones. To overcome this limitation, we propose Unified Hashing (UniHash), a dual-branch framework that unifies the strengths of both paradigms to achieve balanced retrieval performance across seen and unseen categories. UniHash consists of two complementary branches: a center-based branch following the pointwise paradigm and a pairwise branch following the pairwise paradigm. A novel hash code learning method is introduced to enable bidirectional knowledge transfer between branches, improving hash code discriminability and generalization. It employs a mutual learning loss to align hash representations and introduces a Split-Merge Mixture of Hash Experts (SM-MoH) module to enhance cross-branch exchange of hash representations. Theoretical analysis substantiates the effectiveness of UniHash, and extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, and ImageNet demonstrate that UniHash consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both seen and unseen image retrieval scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniHash unifies pointwise and pairwise hashing via dual branches, bidirectional knowledge transfer (mutual loss and SM-MoH), improving discriminability and generalization; SOTA results on standard datasets.", "motivation": "Pointwise methods excel on seen categories while pairwise methods generalize better to unseen; need a unified approach to balance both.", "method": "Dual-branch unified hashing combining pointwise and pairwise paradigms", "result": "Proposes UniHash with center-based (pointwise) and pairwise branches, mutual learning loss, and SM-MoH module; achieves state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10, MSCOCO, ImageNet for seen and unseen retrieval.", "conclusion": "UniHash effectively balances retrieval performance for seen and unseen categories by combining complementary paradigms and enabling cross-branch knowledge transfer, validated theoretically and empirically."}}

To address this, we propose the Video Summary Information Loss (ViSIL) score, an information-theoretic framework that quantifies the video information not captured by a summary via vision-language model (VLM) inference. By measuring the information loss, ViSIL is a unified metric that enables direct comparison across multimodal summary formats despite their structural discrepancies. Our results demonstrate that ViSIL scores show a statistically significant correlation with both human and VLM performance on Video Question Answering (VQA) tasks.

We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.", "AI": {"tldr": "TuneCLIP\u901a\u8fc7warm-up\u6062\u590d\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u6e90CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u6e90CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u5728\u6d77\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u89e3\u51b3\u76f4\u63a5\u7ee7\u7eed\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "Self-supervised fine-tuning of CLIP using existing datasets", "result": "\u63d0\u51faTuneCLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6062\u590d\u4f18\u5316\u7edf\u8ba1\u7684warm-up\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u5047\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0cSigLIP (ViT-B/16) \u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u591a+2.5%\uff0cDataComp\u4e0a+1.2%", "conclusion": "TuneCLIP\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9002\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u91cd\u8bad\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u5f00\u6e90CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

While aerial-based VibrantVS (2.71 m MAE) retains an accuracy advantage, VibrantSR enables operational forest monitoring and carbon accounting at continental scales without reliance on costly and temporally infrequent aerial acquisitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "VibrantSR\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u628a10m Sentinel-2\u5f71\u50cf\u8f6c\u4e3a0.5m CHM\uff0c\u572822\u4e2a\u751f\u6001\u533a\u4e0a\u5bf9>=2m\u51a0\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b04.39m MAE\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u536b\u661f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u5e38\u6001\u5316\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u78b3\u6838\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u57fa\uff08\u822a\u7a7a\uff09\u5f71\u50cf\u83b7\u53d6\u6602\u8d35\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u3001\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u78b3\u6838\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff1bSentinel-2\u6570\u636e\u5168\u7403\u53ef\u7528\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u5e8f\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u51a0\u5c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c0610\u7c73\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684Sentinel-2\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u5408\u6210\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u52300.5\u7c73\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u51a0\u5c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u572822\u4e2aEPA\u4e09\u7ea7\u751f\u6001\u533a\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u536b\u661f\u548c\u822a\u7a7a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u572822\u4e2a\u751f\u6001\u533a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVibrantSR\u5bf9\u9ad8\u5ea6>=2m\u7684\u51a0\u5c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1MAE\u4e3a4.39m\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u536b\u661f\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08Meta 4.83m\u3001LANDFIRE 5.96m\u3001ETH 7.05m\uff09\uff1b\u822a\u7a7a\u57fa\u7ebfVibrantVS\u4ecd\u66f4\u597d\uff082.71m\uff09\u3002VibrantSR\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u822a\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5927\u9646\u7ea7\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e0e\u78b3\u6838\u7b97\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faVibrantSR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece10\u7c73Sentinel-2\u5f71\u50cf\u4f30\u8ba10.5\u7c73\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u51a0\u5c42\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff08CHMs\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5168\u7403\u53ef\u7528\u7684Sentinel-2\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u5408\u6210\u5f71\u50cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b63\u8282\u81f3\u5e74\u5ea6\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u7a7a\u4e2d\u5f71\u50cf\u83b7\u53d6\u4e0d\u89c4\u5f8b\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u7f8e\u56fd\u897f\u90e822\u4e2aEPA\u4e09\u7ea7\u751f\u6001\u533a\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6>=2\u7c73\u7684\u51a0\u5c42\uff0cVibrantSR\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff08MAE\uff09\u4e3a4.39\u7c73\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eMeta\uff084.83\u7c73\uff09\u3001LANDFIRE\uff085.96\u7c73\uff09\u548cETH\uff087.05\u7c73\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u822a\u7a7a\u5f71\u50cf\u7684VibrantVS\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u66f4\u597d\uff08MAE 2.71\u7c73\uff09\uff0cVibrantSR\u4ecd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5927\u9646\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u65e0\u9700\u6602\u8d35\u822a\u7a7a\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u68ee\u6797\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u78b3\u6838\u7b97\u3002"}}

However, achieving fine-grained visual grounding and volumetric spatial reasoning in 3D medical VLMs remains challenging, particularly when aiming to unify these capabilities within a single, generalizable framework. To address this challenge, we proposed MedVL-SAM2, a unified 3D medical multimodal model that concurrently supports report generation, VQA, and multi-paradigm segmentation, including semantic, referring, and interactive segmentation. MedVL-SAM2 integrates image-level reasoning and pixel-level perception through a cohesive architecture tailored for 3D medical imaging, and incorporates a SAM2-based volumetric segmentation module to enable precise multi-granular spatial reasoning. The model is trained in a multi-stage pipeline: it is first pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of 3D CT image-text pairs to align volumetric visual features with radiology-language embeddings. It is then jointly optimized with both language-understanding and segmentation objectives using a comprehensive 3D CT segmentation dataset. This joint training enables flexible interaction via language, point, or box prompts, thereby unifying high-level visual reasoning with spatially precise localization. Our unified architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance across report generation, VQA, and multiple 3D segmentation tasks.

In this work, we present Transition Matching Distillation (TMD), a novel framework for distilling video diffusion models into efficient few-step generators. The central idea of TMD is to match the multi-step denoising trajectory of a diffusion model with a few-step probability transition process, where each transition is modeled as a lightweight conditional flow. To enable efficient distillation, we decompose the original diffusion backbone into two components: (1) a main backbone, comprising the majority of early layers, that extracts semantic representations at each outer transition step; and (2) a flow head, consisting of the last few layers, that leverages these representations to perform multiple inner flow updates. Given a pretrained video diffusion model, we first introduce a flow head to the model, and adapt it into a conditional flow map. We then apply distribution matching distillation to the student model with flow head rollout in each transition step. Extensive experiments on distilling Wan2.1 1.3B and 14B text-to-video models demonstrate that TMD provides a flexible and strong trade-off between generation speed and visual quality. In particular, TMD outperforms existing distilled models under comparable inference costs in terms of visual fidelity and prompt adherence.

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication. Code will be released upon acceptance", "summary": "Reliable traversable area segmentation in unstructured environments is critical for planning and decision-making in autonomous driving. However, existing data-driven approaches often suffer from degraded segmentation performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, consequently impairing downstream driving tasks. To address this issue, we propose OT-Drive, an Optimal Transport--driven multi-modal fusion framework. The proposed method formulates RGB and surface normal fusion as a distribution transport problem. Specifically, we design a novel Scene Anchor Generator (SAG) to decompose scene information into the joint distribution of weather, time-of-day, and road type, thereby constructing semantic anchors that can generalize to unseen scenarios. Subsequently, we design an innovative Optimal Transport-based multi-modal fusion module (OT Fusion) to transport RGB and surface normal features onto the manifold defined by the semantic anchors, enabling robust traversable area segmentation under OOD scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves 95.16% mIoU on ORFD OOD scenarios, outperforming prior methods by 6.35%, and 89.79% mIoU on cross-dataset transfer tasks, surpassing baselines by 13.99%.These results indicate that the proposed model can attain strong OOD generalization with only limited training data, substantially enhancing its practicality and efficiency for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faOT-Drive\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93(Optimal Transport)\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u5728\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u7684OOD\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u573a\u666f\u951a(Scene Anchor Generator)\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u9053\u8def\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u518d\u7528OT Fusion\u5c06RGB\u548c\u6cd5\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7531\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728OOD\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u5206\u5272\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5728ORFD OOD\u573a\u666f\u4e0amIoU\u8fbe95.16%\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe89.79%\uff0c\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728OOD\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1Scene Anchor Generator(SAG)\u5c06\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u65f6\u6bb5\u3001\u8def\u9762\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7684OT Fusion\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06RGB\u4e0e\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u8f93\u5230\u951a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u3002", "result": "\u5728ORFD OOD\u573a\u666f\u4e0amIoU=95.16%\uff08\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd56.35%\uff09\uff0c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1mIoU=89.79%\uff08\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf13.99%\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "OT-Drive\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728OOD\u573a\u666f\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u901a\u884c\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8f83\u5f3a\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Current VLMs are typically built with contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) style image encoders.

We argue that this lack of spatial awareness is a missing dimension in VLM design and a bottleneck for applications requiring spatial grounding, such as robotics and embodied AI.

However, existing methods typically suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning chains that interfere with object localization in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). To address this issue, we propose DR$^2$Seg, a self-rewarding framework that improves both reasoning efficiency and segmentation accuracy without requiring extra thinking supervision. DR$^2$Seg employs a two-stage rollout strategy that decomposes reasoning segmentation into multimodal reasoning and referring segmentation. In the first stage, the model generates a self-contained description that explicitly specifies the target object. In the second stage, this description replaces the original complex query to verify its self-containment. Based on this design, two self-rewards are introduced to strengthen goal-oriented reasoning and suppress redundant thinking.

However, the high dimensionality of multi-metric data with diverse structural forms, the heterogeneity of neuroimaging and phenotypic data, and class imbalance collectively pose significant challenges to early ND diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamically weighted dual graph attention network (DW-DGAT) that integrates: (1) a general-purpose data fusion strategy to merge three structural forms of multi-metric data; (2) a dual graph attention architecture based on brain regions and inter-sample relationships to extract both micro- and macro-level features; and (3) a class weight generation mechanism combined with two stable and effective loss functions to mitigate class imbalance.

Existing research has primarily focused on hallucinations involving the presence of events, objects, and scenes in videos, while largely neglecting event relation hallucination. In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark for evaluating the Video Event Relation Hallucination, named VERHallu. This benchmark focuses on causal, temporal, and subevent relations between events, encompassing three types of tasks: relation classification, question answering, and counterfactual question answering, for a comprehensive evaluation of event relation hallucination. Additionally, it features counterintuitive video scenarios that deviate from typical pretraining distributions, with each sample accompanied by human-annotated candidates covering both vision-language and pure language biases. Our analysis reveals that current state-of-the-art VideoLLMs struggle with dense-event relation reasoning, often relying on prior knowledge due to insufficient use of frame-level cues. Although these models demonstrate strong grounding capabilities for key events, they often overlook the surrounding subevents, leading to an incomplete and inaccurate understanding of event relations. To tackle this, we propose a Key-Frame Propagating (KFP) strategy, which reallocates frame-level attention within intermediate layers to enhance multi-event understanding. Experiments show it effectively mitigates the event relation hallucination without affecting inference speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "VERHallu benchmark reveals VideoLLMs hallucinate event relations; models rely on priors and miss subevents.

To address these issues, we propose DiCo (Disentangled Concept Representation), a novel framework that achieves hierarchical and disentangled cross-modal alignment. DiCo introduces a shared slot-based representation, where each slot acts as a part-level anchor across modalities and is further decomposed into multiple concept blocks. This design enables the disentanglement of complementary attributes (\\textit{e.g.}, color, texture, shape) while maintaining consistent part-level correspondence between image and text.

These effects impair standard cameras and make ground-truth motion nearly impossible to obtain. On the other hand, event cameras offer microsecond resolution and high dynamic range. Nonetheless, progress on investigating event cameras for underwater environments has been limited due to the lack of datasets that pair realistic underwater optics with accurate optical flow. To address this problem, we introduce the first synthetic underwater benchmark dataset for event-based optical flow derived from physically-based ray-traced RGBD sequences. Using a modern video-to-event pipeline applied to rendered underwater videos, we produce realistic event data streams with dense ground-truth flow, depth, and camera motion.

With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduce CoF-T2I, use CoF trajectories dataset and independent frame encoding to enable stepwise T2I generation, improving quality", "motivation": "Leverage CoF reasoning from video models to improve interpretability and performance of T2I by using intermediate frames as explicit reasoning steps", "method": "Progressive visual refinement using Chain-of-Frame reasoning", "result": "CoF-T2I outperforms base video models and achieves competitive results on benchmarks (GenEval 0.86, Imagine-Bench 7.468)", "conclusion": "Video models with CoF reasoning can substantially advance high-quality T2I generation when guided by curated trajectories and independent frame encoding"}}

The budgeted-sufficiency objective yields small, spatially compact evidence sets without sacrificing baseline performance. Across TCGA-NSCLC (LUAD vs. LUSC), TCGA-BRCA (IDC vs. Others), and PANDA, ReaMIL matches or slightly improves baseline AUC and provides quantitative evidence-efficiency diagnostics. On NSCLC, it attains AUC 0.983 with a mean minimal sufficient K (MSK) $\\approx 8.2$ tiles at $\u03c4= 0.90$ and AUKC $\\approx 0.864$, showing that class confidence rises sharply and stabilizes once a small set of tiles is kept.

To authentically reproduce Post-Impressionist stylization, geometric abstraction must be embraced as the primary vehicle of expression.\n  We propose a flow-guided geometric advection framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operationalizes this principle in a mesh-free setting. Our method extracts directional flow fields from 2D paintings and back-propagates them into 3D space, rectifying Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes that conform to scene topology without relying on explicit mesh priors. This enables expressive structural deformation driven directly by painterly motion rather than photometric constraints.\n  Our contributions are threefold: (1) a projection-based, mesh-free flow guidance mechanism that transfers 2D artistic motion into 3D Gaussian geometry; (2) a luminance-structure decoupling strategy that isolates geometric deformation from color optimization, mitigating artifacts during aggressive structural abstraction; and (3) a VLM-as-a-Judge evaluation framework that assesses artistic authenticity through aesthetic judgment instead of conventional pixel-level metrics, explicitly addressing the subjective nature of artistic stylization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduce mesh-free flow guidance to deform 3D Gaussians according to 2D painting flows, decouple luminance from structure, and evaluate with vision-language model aesthetics", "motivation": "Existing 3D style transfer treats geometry as static and only transfers surface textures; to mimic Post-Impressionist emphasis on exaggerated form, geometry must be abstracted as primary expression", "method": "flow-guided geometric advection for 3DGS", "result": "A mesh-free method that backpropagates 2D flow into 3D Gaussian primitives to form flow-aligned brushstrokes, plus luminance-structure decoupling and VLM-based evaluation", "conclusion": "Flow-guided geometric advection enables painterly geometric abstraction in 3DGS, producing expressive, topology-aware stylizations beyond texture-only methods"}}

Existing approaches typically focus on features extracted from the original dataset, overlooking task-specific information, which leads to a target gap between the distillation objective and the downstream task. We propose leveraging characteristics that benefit the downstream training into data distillation to bridge this gap. Focusing on the downstream task of image classification, we introduce the concept of difficulty and propose DGS as a plug-in post-stage sampling module. Following the specific target difficulty distribution, the final distilled dataset is sampled from image pools generated by existing methods.

However, state-of-the-art approaches rely heavily on large-scale human-annotated datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we introduce V-Zero, a general post-training framework that facilitates self-improvement using exclusively unlabeled images. V-Zero establishes a co-evolutionary loop by instantiating two distinct roles: a Questioner and a Solver. The Questioner learns to synthesize high-quality, challenging questions by leveraging a dual-track reasoning reward that contrasts intuitive guesses with reasoned results. The Solver is optimized using pseudo-labels derived from majority voting over its own sampled responses. Both roles are trained iteratively via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), driving a cycle of mutual enhancement. Remarkably, without a single human annotation, V-Zero achieves consistent performance gains on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, improving visual mathematical reasoning by +1.7 and general vision-centric by +2.6, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement in multimodal systems.

However, existing methods often rely on pseudo-labeling, or two-stage clustering, which lack a principled mechanism to explicitly disentangle essential, category-defining signals from instance-specific noise. In this paper, we address this fundamental limitation by re-framing GCD from an information-theoretic perspective, grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. We introduce InfoSculpt, a novel framework that systematically sculpts the representation space by minimizing a dual Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) objective. InfoSculpt uniquely combines a Category-Level CMI on labeled data to learn compact and discriminative representations for known classes, and a complementary Instance-Level CMI on all data to distill invariant features by compressing augmentation-induced noise. These two objectives work synergistically at different scales to produce a disentangled and robust latent space where categorical information is preserved while noisy, instance-specific details are discarded.

Built upon a MMDiT architecture, FlowAct-R1 enables the streaming synthesis of video with arbitrary durations while maintaining low-latency responsiveness. We introduce a chunkwise diffusion forcing strategy, complemented by a novel self-forcing variant, to alleviate error accumulation and ensure long-term temporal consistency during continuous interaction. By leveraging efficient distillation and system-level optimizations, our framework achieves a stable 25fps at 480p resolution with a time-to-first-frame (TTFF) of only around 1.5 seconds. The proposed method provides holistic and fine-grained full-body control, enabling the agent to transition naturally between diverse behavioral states in interactive scenarios.

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on clean documents or generic layout analysis, overlooking both the structural integrity of mathematical problems and the ability of models to actively reject incomplete inputs. We introduce MathDoc, the first benchmark for document-level information extraction from authentic high school mathematics exam papers. MathDoc contains \\textbf{3,609} carefully curated questions with real-world artifacts and explicitly includes unrecognizable samples to evaluate active refusal behavior. We propose a multi-dimensional evaluation framework covering stem accuracy, visual similarity, and refusal capability. Experiments on SOTA MLLMs, including Qwen3-VL and Gemini-2.5-Pro, show that although end-to-end models achieve strong extraction performance, they consistently fail to refuse illegible inputs, instead producing confident but invalid outputs. These results highlight a critical gap in current MLLMs and establish MathDoc as a benchmark for assessing model reliability under degraded document conditions.

The dominant \"retrieve-then-prompt\" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u7d22-\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u9009\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f73\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u5c06top-K\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e22\u5931\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5206\u652f\u5e76\u7528MULTI-VQGAN\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u878d\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u5c06\u591a\u63d0\u793a\u5408\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e00\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5e76\u534f\u540c\u5229\u7528\u591a\u63d0\u793a\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u7684\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347VICL\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u68c0\u7d22top-K\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u6761\u4e92\u8865\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u793a\u5206\u652f\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1MULTI-VQGAN\u67b6\u6784\u4ee5\u5e76\u884c/\u8054\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u652f\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u62ec\u63d0\u793a\u7ec4\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5206\u652f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u53ca\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u7ec4\u5408\u534f\u540c\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e09\u6761\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u793a\u5206\u652f\u5e76\u8f93\u5165MULTI-VQGAN\u6765\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u5728\u524d\u666f\u5206\u5272\u3001\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7740\u8272\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7ec4\u5408\u534f\u540c\u878d\u5408\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u7559\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MULTI-VQGAN\u8054\u5408\u89e3\u91ca\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements.\n  We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model.

However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

However, in the domain of Video Anomaly Detection and Understanding (VAD&U), existing MLLM-based methods are largely limited to anomaly localization or post-hoc description, lacking explicit reasoning processes, risk awareness, and decision-oriented interpretation. To address this gap, we define a new task termed Video Anomaly Reasoning (VAR), which elevates video anomaly analysis from descriptive understanding to structured, multi-stage reasoning. VAR explicitly requires models to perform progressive reasoning over anomalous events before answering anomaly-related questions, encompassing visual perception, causal interpretation, and risk-aware decision making. To support this task, we present a new dataset with 8,641 videos, where each video is annotated with diverse question types corresponding to different reasoning depths, totaling more than 50,000 samples, making it one of the largest datasets for video anomaly. The annotations are based on a structured Perception-Cognition-Action Chain-of-Thought (PerCoAct-CoT), which formalizes domain-specific reasoning priors for video anomaly understanding. This design enables systematic evaluation of multi-stage and adaptive anomaly reasoning. In addition, we propose Anomaly-Aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to further enhance reasoning reliability under weak supervision. Building upon the proposed task and dataset, we develop an end-to-end MLLM-based VAR model termed Vad-R1-Plus, which supports adaptive hierarchical reasoning and risk-aware decision making.

A 3DSG is constructed from multiple images of a scene, where objects are represented as nodes and relationships as edges.

To address these challenges, we propose RAG-3DSG to mitigate aggregation noise through re-shot guided uncertainty estimation and support object-level Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via reliable low-uncertainty objects. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic downsample-mapping strategy to accelerate cross-image object aggregation with adaptive granularity.

Although existing methods achieve promising results by introducing prompt information or leveraging large models, the added learning modules increase system complexity and hinder real-time applicability. In this paper, we adopt a physical degradation modeling perspective and predict a task-aware inverse degradation operator for efficient all-in-one image restoration. The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage, the predicted inverse operator produces an initial restored image together with an uncertainty perception map that highlights regions difficult to reconstruct, ensuring restoration reliability. In the second stage, the restoration is further refined under the guidance of this uncertainty map. The same inverse operator prediction network is used in both stages, with task-aware parameters introduced after operator prediction to adapt to different degradation tasks. Moreover, by accelerating the convolution of the inverse operator, the proposed method achieves efficient all-in-one image restoration.

Prior works rely either on a 3D data prior or a 2D generative prior to compensate for missing visual cues in monocular videos. However, 3D data prior methods often struggle to generalize in-the-wild, while 2D generative prior methods are computationally heavy and prone to identity hallucination. We identify a complementary synergy between these two priors and design an efficient system that achieves high-fidelity animatable avatar synthesis with strong in-the-wild generalization. Specifically, we introduce a feed-forward Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM) that enables fast initialization of a Gaussian avatar. To further bridge the domain gap at test time, we design a test-time generative adaptation stage, leveraging both real and synthetic images as supervision. Unlike previous full diffusion denoising strategies that are slow and hallucination-prone, we propose a rendering-guided single-step diffusion enhancer that restores missing visual details, grounded on Gaussian avatar renderings. Our experiments demonstrate that ELITE produces visually superior avatars to prior works, even for challenging expressions, while achieving 60x faster synthesis than the 2D generative prior method.", "AI": {"tldr": "ELITE\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5934\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5b83\u7ed3\u5408\u4e863D\u6570\u636e\u5148\u9a8c\u548c2D\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u4f18\u70b9\uff1a\u7528Mesh2Gaussian\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u5934\u50cf\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff08\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u76d1\u7763\uff09\u5f25\u8865\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u6e32\u67d3\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u589e\u5f3a\u5668\u6bd4\u5168\u6269\u6563\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u66f4\u4e0d\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u8eab\u4efd\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6548\u679c\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\uff08\u7ea660\u500d\uff09\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u514b\u670d\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u7f3a\u5931\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5355\u4e00\u4f7f\u75283D\u5148\u9a8c\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\uff0c2D\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8eab\u4efd\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u671f\u671b\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) Mesh2Gaussian Prior Model (MGPM)\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7f51\u683c\u5feb\u901f\u524d\u5411\u63a8\u65ad\u9ad8\u65af\u5934\u50cf\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b2) \u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6e32\u67d3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u589e\u5f3a\u5668\u4fee\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b3) \u6574\u4f53\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4f7f\u5408\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8eab\u4efd\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cELITE\u5728\u53ef\u9a71\u52a8\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u8868\u60c5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5408\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb\u7ea660\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ELITE\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5934\u50cf\uff0c\u517c\u5177\u5728\u91ce\u5916\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6781\u9ad8\u7684\u5408\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The mainstream approach to achieving precise camera control is warping a 3D representation according to the target trajectory. However, such methods fail to fully leverage the 3D priors of video diffusion models (VDMs) and often fall into the Inpainting Trap, resulting in subject inconsistency and degraded generation quality. To address this problem, we propose DepthDirector, a video re-rendering framework with precise camera controllability. By leveraging the depth video from explicit 3D representation as camera-control guidance, our method can faithfully reproduce the dynamic scene of an input video under novel camera trajectories. Specifically, we design a View-Content Dual-Stream Condition mechanism that injects both the source video and the warped depth sequence rendered under the target viewpoint into the pretrained video generation model. This geometric guidance signal enables VDMs to comprehend camera movements and leverage their 3D understanding capabilities, thereby facilitating precise camera control and consistent content generation. Next, we introduce a lightweight LoRA-based video diffusion adapter to train our framework, fully preserving the knowledge priors of VDMs. Additionally, we construct a large-scale multi-camera synchronized dataset named MultiCam-WarpData using Unreal Engine 5, containing 8K videos across 1K dynamic scenes. Extensive experiments show that DepthDirector outperforms existing methods in both camera controllability and visual quality.

While the entire slide is visible, identifying the relevant regions can be challenging. As you focus on one part of the slide, the speaker moves on to a new sentence, leaving you scrambling to catch up visually. This constant back-and-forth creates a disconnect between what is being said and the most important visual elements, making it hard to absorb key details, especially in fast-paced or content-heavy presentations such as conference talks. This requires an understanding of slides, including text, graphics, and layout. We introduce a method that automatically identifies and highlights the most relevant slide regions based on the speaker's narrative. By analyzing spoken content and matching it with textual or graphical elements in the slides, our approach ensures better synchronization between what listeners hear and what they need to attend to.

We further introduce a ScMix augmentation strategy that diversifies visual contexts and strengthens both global and local utility of UAPs, thereby reducing reliance on spurious features. In addition, we refine the optimization path by leveraging a temporal hierarchy of historical and estimated future gradients to avoid local minima and stabilize universal perturbation learning.

Despite the widespread adoption of deep neural network (DNN)-based SAR automatic target recognition (SAR-ATR) systems, they remain vulnerable to adversarial examples and tend to over-rely on background regions, leading to degraded adversarial robustness. Existing adversarial attacks for SAR-ATR often require visually perceptible distortions to achieve effective performance, thereby necessitating an attack method that balances effectiveness and stealthiness. In this paper, a novel attack method termed Space-Reweighted Adversarial Warping (SRAW) is proposed, which generates adversarial examples through optimized spatial deformation with reweighted budgets across foreground and background regions.

Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4.

This motivates earlier works that render the Transformer's input into images for prefilling, which effectively reduces the number of tokens through visual encoding, thereby alleviating the quadratically increased Attention computations. However, this partial compression fails to save computational or memory costs at token-by-token inference. In this paper, we investigate global context compression, which saves tokens at both prefilling and inference stages. Consequently, we propose VIST2, a novel Transformer that interleaves input text chunks alongside their visual encoding, while depending exclusively on visual tokens in the pre-context to predict the next text token distribution. Around this idea, we render text chunks into sketch images and train VIST2 in multiple stages, starting from curriculum-scheduled pretraining for optical language modeling, followed by modal-interleaved instruction tuning. We conduct extensive experiments using VIST2 families scaled from 0.6B to 8B to explore the training recipe and hyperparameters.

While Multimodal Deep Learning (MDL) offers a promises for precision prognosis and survival prediction, its clinical applicability is severely limited by small cohort sizes and the presence of missing modalities, often forcing complete-case filtering or aggressive imputation. In this work, we present a missing-aware multimodal survival framework that integrates Computed Tomography (CT), Whole-Slide Histopathology (WSI) Images, and structured clinical variables for overall survival modeling in unresectable stage II-III NSCLC. By leveraging Foundation Models (FM) for modality-specific feature extraction and a missing-aware encoding strategy, the proposed approach enables intermediate multimodal fusion under naturally incomplete modality profiles. The proposed architecture is resilient to missing modalities by design, allowing the model to utilize all available data without being forced to drop patients during training or inference. Experimental results demonstrate that intermediate fusion consistently outperforms unimodal baselines as well as early and late fusion strategies, with the strongest performance achieved by the fusion of WSI and clinical modalities (73.30 C-index). Further analyses of modality importance reveal an adaptive behavior in which less informative modalities, i.e., CT modality, are automatically down-weighted and contribute less to the final survival prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528FM\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u505a\u7f3a\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728II-III\u671f\u4e0d\u53ef\u5207\u9664NSCLC\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0cWSI+\u4e34\u5e8a\u878d\u5408\u8fbe\u523073.30 C-index\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u4e0e\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5c0f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728NSCLC\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9700\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u4e14\u80fd\u6574\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Foundation Models\u8fdb\u884c\u6bcf\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\uff08CT\u3001WSI\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u79cd\u7f3a\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e22\u5f03\u60a3\u8005\u6216\u8fdb\u884c\u6fc0\u8fdb\u63d2\u8865\u3002", "result": "\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u53ca\u65e9/\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\uff1bWSI+\u4e34\u5e8a\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\u6700\u4f73\uff0cC-index\u4e3a0.7330\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u8c03\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u5982CT\uff09\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u5b58\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u53ef\u5207\u9664II-III\u671fNSCLC\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u4e2d\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u542b\u7f3a\u5931\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u65e9\u671f\u548c\u665a\u671f\u878d\u5408\u3002"}}

Existing lunar rendering pipelines rely on simplified or spatially uniform BRDF models whose parameters are difficult to estimate and fail to capture local reflectance variations, limiting photometric realism. We propose Lunar-G2R, a geometry-to-reflectance learning framework that predicts spatially varying BRDF parameters directly from a lunar digital elevation model (DEM), without requiring multi-view imagery, controlled illumination, or dedicated reflectance-capture hardware at inference time. The method leverages a U-Net trained with differentiable rendering to minimize photometric discrepancies between real orbital images and physically based renderings under known viewing and illumination geometry. Experiments on a geographically held-out region of the Tycho crater show that our approach reduces photometric error by 38 % compared to a state-of-the-art baseline, while achieving higher PSNR and SSIM and improved perceptual similarity, capturing fine-scale reflectance variations absent from spatially uniform models.

Segmenting these various entities from satellite imagery is crucial for a range of downstream applications. Current advanced segmentation models can reliably segment entities defined by physical attributes (e.g., buildings, water bodies) but still struggle with socially defined categories (e.g., schools, parks). In this work, we achieve socio-semantic segmentation by vision-language model reasoning. To facilitate this, we introduce the Urban Socio-Semantic Segmentation dataset named SocioSeg, a new resource comprising satellite imagery, digital maps, and pixel-level labels of social semantic entities organized in a hierarchical structure. Additionally, we propose a novel vision-language reasoning framework called SocioReasoner that simulates the human process of identifying and annotating social semantic entities via cross-modal recognition and multi-stage reasoning. We employ reinforcement learning to optimize this non-differentiable process and elicit the reasoning capabilities of the vision-language model.

Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, \\emph{continued fine-tuning (CFT)}, which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6\\% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. % We show \\emph{the first time} superior performance than CLIP on both DTD and EuroSAT, on cross-dataset transfer.

The proposed work investigates the use of the deep learning models to enhance the automatic, machine-based readability of gauge in smoky environments, with accurate gauge data interpretation serving as a valuable tool for first responders. The study utilizes two deep learning architectures, FFA-Net and AECR-Net, to improve the visibility of gauge images, corrupted with light up to dense haze and smoke. Since benchmark datasets of analog gauge images are unavailable, a new synthetic dataset, containing over 14,000 images, was generated using the Unreal Engine. The models were trained with an 80\\% train, 10\\% validation, and 10\\% test split for the haze and smoke dataset, respectively. For the synthetic haze dataset, the SSIM and PSNR metrics are about 0.98 and 43\\,dB, respectively, comparing well to state-of-the art results. Additionally, more robust results are retrieved from the AECR-Net, when compared to the FFA-Net. Although the results from the synthetic smoke dataset are poorer, the trained models achieve interesting results. In general, imaging in the presence of smoke are more difficult to enhance given the inhomogeneity and high density. Secondly, FFA-Net and AECR-Net are implemented to dehaze and not to desmoke images. This work shows that use of deep learning architectures can improve the quality of analog gauge images captured in smoke and haze scenes immensely.

While Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) excel at open-world recognition, they often struggle to accurately interpret complex facility states in compliance with engineering standards, leading to unreliable performance in real-world applications. To address this, we propose a domain-adapted framework that transforms VLMs into specialized agents for intelligent infrastructure analysis. Our approach integrates a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy with a knowledge-grounded reasoning mechanism. Specifically, we leverage open-vocabulary fine-tuning on Grounding DINO to robustly localize diverse assets with minimal supervision, followed by LoRA-based adaptation on Qwen-VL for deep semantic attribute reasoning. To mitigate hallucinations and enforce professional compliance, we introduce a dual-modality Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that dynamically retrieves authoritative industry standards and visual exemplars during inference.

While some attribute this deficiency to insufficient physics understanding from pre-training, we find that the shortfall in physics plausibility also stems from suboptimal inference strategies. We therefore introduce WMReward and treat improving physics plausibility of video generation as an inference-time alignment problem. In particular, we leverage the strong physics prior of a latent world model (here, VJEPA-2) as a reward to search and steer multiple candidate denoising trajectories, enabling scaling test-time compute for better generation performance.

However, current benchmarks are impeded by a notable scarcity of scenarios featuring dense traffic, which is essential for understanding and modeling complex interactions among road users. To address this gap, we collaborated with our industrial partner, DeepScenario, to develop DeepUrban-a new drone dataset designed to enhance trajectory prediction and planning benchmarks focusing on dense urban settings. DeepUrban provides a rich collection of 3D traffic objects, extracted from high-resolution images captured over urban intersections at approximately 100 meters altitude. The dataset is further enriched with comprehensive map and scene information to support advanced modeling and simulation tasks. We evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) prediction and planning methods, and conducted experiments on generalization capabilities. Our findings demonstrate that adding DeepUrban to nuScenes can boost the accuracy of vehicle predictions and planning, achieving improvements up to 44.1 % / 44.3% on the ADE / FDE metrics.

However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.\n  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \\emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $\u03b2_0 = \u03b2_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.\n  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks.

Our method first drives mesh-based 3D facial motion from speech, then binds 3D Gaussians to mesh facets to render high-fidelity 2D avatar videos. To capture interpersonal dynamics, we propose a socially-aware module that encodes social relationships, including blood and non-blood as well as equal and unequal, into high-level embeddings through a learnable query mechanism. We design a three-stage training paradigm and construct the RSATalker dataset with speech-mesh-image triplets annotated with social relationships. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSATalker achieves state-of-the-art performance in both realism and social awareness. The code and dataset will be released.", "AI": {"tldr": "RSATalker\u7ed3\u5408mesh\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u5230\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e3D Gaussian Splatting\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u65b0\u589e\u793e\u4f1a\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\u652f\u6301\u8840\u7f18/\u975e\u8840\u7f18\u4e0e\u5e73\u7b49/\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8303\u5f0f\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u5e26\u793e\u4ea4\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u53ca\u793e\u4ea4\u5efa\u6a21\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u9ad8\u6548\u53c8\u80fd\u8868\u8fbe\u793e\u4ea4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u7528\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8mesh\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u518d\u5c063D Gaussians\u7ed1\u5b9a\u5230\u7f51\u683c\u9762\u4ee5\u6e32\u67d3\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f2D\u89c6\u9891\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60query\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u7f16\u7801\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u7528\u542b\u5173\u7cfb\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u8bed\u97f3-\u7f51\u683c-\u56fe\u50cf\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "RSATalker\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D Gaussian Splatting\u7684\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u7f51\u683c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u517c\u987e\u903c\u771f\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "RSATalker\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u611f\u4e0e\u793e\u4ea4\u610f\u8bc6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u5408VR\u591a\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).", "AI": {"tldr": "Molmo2 \u662f\u4e00\u5957\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f00\u653eVLM\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u90e8\u5206\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5f3aVLM\u591a\u4e3a\u95ed\u6e90\uff0c\u5f00\u653e\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6216\u672a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e/\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u793e\u533a\u65e0\u6cd5\u63a8\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u4e14\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u95ed\u6e90\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u5177\u5907\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u516c\u5f007\u4e2a\u65b0\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e2\u4e2a\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u8be6\u7ec6\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u3001\u81ea\u7531\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u6307\u5411\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u95ed\u6e90VLM\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u7684packing\u4e0emessage-tree\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u89c6\u89c9tokens\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u65b0\u578btoken\u6743\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd/\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\uff1b8B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u3001\u8ba1\u6570\u3001\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u5bf9\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e5f\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u89c6\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u653e\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Qwen3-VL\uff09\u5e76\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u8d85\u8fc7\u95ed\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6307\u5411\u548c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u4e8eGemini 3 Pro\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "Molmo2 \u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6743\u91cd\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u4ee3\u7801\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08pointing\u3001tracking\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Based on this, we present CoMoVi, a co-generative framework that couples two video diffusion models (VDMs) to generate 3D human motions and videos synchronously within a single diffusion denoising loop. To achieve this, we first propose an effective 2D human motion representation that can inherit the powerful prior of pre-trained VDMs. Then, we design a dual-branch diffusion model to couple human motion and video generation process with mutual feature interaction and 3D-2D cross attentions. Moreover, we curate CoMoVi Dataset, a large-scale real-world human video dataset with text and motion annotations, covering diverse and challenging human motions.

However, current benchmarks predominantly feature western-centric data and English as the dominant language, introducing significant biases in evaluation. To address this, we introduce CURVE (Cultural Understanding and Reasoning in Video Evaluation), a challenging benchmark for multicultural and multilingual video reasoning. CURVE comprises high-quality, entirely human-generated annotations from diverse, region-specific cultural videos across 18 global locales. Unlike prior work that relies on automatic translations, CURVE provides complex questions, answers, and multi-step reasoning steps, all crafted in native languages. Making progress on CURVE requires a deeply situated understanding of visual cultural context. Furthermore, we leverage CURVE's reasoning traces to construct evidence-based graphs and propose a novel iterative strategy using these graphs to identify fine-grained errors in reasoning. Our evaluations reveal that SoTA Video-LLMs struggle significantly, performing substantially below human-level accuracy, with errors primarily stemming from the visual perception of cultural elements.

Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) serve as critical bioindicators of ecosystem health, providing valuable insights into biodiversity shifts driven by environmental changes. While the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) maintains an extensive collection of carabid specimens from across the United States, these primarily exist as physical collections, restricting widespread research access and large-scale analysis. To address these gaps, we present a multimodal dataset digitizing over 13,200 NEON carabids from 30 sites spanning the continental US and Hawaii through high-resolution imaging, enabling broader access and computational analysis. The dataset includes digitally measured elytra length and width of each specimen, establishing a foundation for automated trait extraction using AI.

We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly redundant. We quantify redundancy in such (BLIP2) features via PCA and cross-patch similarity: $90$% of variance is captured by $17/64$ principal components, and strong inter-token correlations are pervasive. Training on such overlapping information leads the policy to overfit spurious correlations, hurting OOD robustness. We present Stochastic-Patch-Selection (SPS), a simple yet effective approach for learning policies that are more robust, generalizable, and efficient. For every frame, SPS randomly masks a fraction of patch descriptors, not feeding them to the policy model, while preserving the spatial layout of the remaining patches. Thus, the policy is provided with different stochastic but complete views of the (same) scene: every random subset of patches acts like a different, yet still sensible, coherent projection of the world. The policy thus bases its decisions on features that are invariant to which specific tokens survive. Extensive experiments confirm that across all OOD scenarios, our method outperforms the state of the art (SOTA), achieving a $6.2$% average improvement and up to $20.4$% in closed-loop simulations, while being $2.4\\times$ faster. We conduct ablations over masking rates and patch-feature reorganization, training and evaluating 9 systems, with 8 of them surpassing prior SOTA.

This static architecture fundamentally limits the ability of LLMs to achieve comprehensive alignment with hierarchical visual knowledge, compromising their capacity to accurately integrate local details with global semantics into coherent reasoning. To resolve this, we introduce Cross-Layer Injection (CLI), a novel and lightweight framework that forges a dynamic many-to-many bridge between the two modalities. CLI consists of two synergistic, parameter-efficient components: an Adaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) module that harmonizes features from diverse vision layers, and an Adaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) mechanism that empowers the LLM to selectively inject the most relevant visual information based on its real-time decoding context. We validate the effectiveness and versatility of CLI by integrating it into LLaVA-OneVision and LLaVA-1.5. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements, establishing CLI as a scalable paradigm that unlocks deeper multimodal understanding by granting LLMs on-demand access to the full visual hierarchy.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLI\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0eLLM\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95e8\u63a7\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3VLM\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f7fLLM\u6309\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u89c6\u89c9\u5c42\u6b21\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u884cVLM\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u63a5\u5165LLM\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5355\u70b9\u3001\u9759\u6001\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u4ece\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7ec6\u8282\u5230\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u88abLLM\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCLI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ecAdaptive Multi-Projection (AMP) \u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u89c4\u8303\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caAdaptive Gating Fusion (AGF) \u5141\u8bb8LLM\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u5c06CLI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u5757\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709VLM\uff08\u5982LLaVA-OneVision\u548cLLaVA-1.5\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6216\u90e8\u5206\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u572818\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5bf9LLaVA-OneVision\u4e0eLLaVA-1.5\u96c6\u6210CLI\u540e\u5747\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86CLI\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5176\u4ed6VLM\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Cross-Layer Injection (CLI) \u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f13\u89e3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u591a\u5c42\u4e0e\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53cc\u5411\u6865\u63a5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u8de8\u5c42\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

We allow changing color, texture, material, and even the shape of an object, while preserving its perceived identity and scene context. Existing approaches either rely on unsupervised priors that often fail to preserve identity or use overly restrictive supervision that prevents meaningful intrinsic variations. Our method relies on: (i) a relaxed training objective that allows the model to change both intrinsic and extrinsic attributes conditioned on an identity reference image, a textual prompt describing the target intrinsic attributes, and a background image and object mask defining the extrinsic context. At inference, we restrict extrinsic changes by reusing the original background and object mask, thereby ensuring that only the desired intrinsic attributes are altered; (ii) Visual Named Entities (VNEs) - fine-grained visual identity categories (e.g., ''Porsche 911 Carrera'') that group objects sharing identity-defining features while allowing variation in intrinsic attributes. We use a vision-language model to automatically extract VNE labels and intrinsic attribute descriptions from a large public image dataset, enabling scalable, identity-preserving supervision. Alterbute outperforms existing methods on identity-preserving object intrinsic attribute editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAlterbute\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fee\u6539\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u989c\u8272\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u6750\u6599\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\u3002\u5173\u952e\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\u677e\u5f1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5bf9\u5185\u5728\u4e0e\u5916\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u90fd\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u800c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u539f\u59cb\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u906e\u7f69\u9650\u5236\u5916\u5728\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\uff08VNEs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8eab\u4efd\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u53d6VNE\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u76d1\u7763\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eAlterbute\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u7f16\u8f91\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u76d1\u7763\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5185\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6545\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u53c8\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e30\u5bcc\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u8eab\u4efd\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u76ee\u6807\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u56fe\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u906e\u7f69\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5141\u8bb8\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u53d8\u5185\u5728\u4e0e\u5916\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u56fa\u5b9a\u539f\u59cb\u80cc\u666f\u4e0e\u906e\u7f69\u4ee5\u9650\u5236\u5916\u5728\u53d8\u5316\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u6784\u5efa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6VNE\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u6587\u672c\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cAlterbute\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u5728\u989c\u8272\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u6750\u6599\u4e43\u81f3\u5f62\u72b6\u4fee\u6539\u65f6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Alterbute\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f16\u8f91\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u8fc7VNE\u548c\u677e\u5f1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u7559\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Dynamic content breaks the multi-view consistency that static NVS models rely on, leading to ghosting, hallucinated geometry, and unstable pose estimation. WildRayZer addresses this by performing an analysis-by-synthesis test: a camera-only static renderer explains rigid structure, and its residuals reveal transient regions. From these residuals, we construct pseudo motion masks, distill a motion estimator, and use it to mask input tokens and gate loss gradients so supervision focuses on cross-view background completion. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate Dynamic RealEstate10K (D-RE10K), a real-world dataset of 15K casually captured dynamic sequences, and D-RE10K-iPhone, a paired transient and clean benchmark for sparse-view transient-aware NVS.
