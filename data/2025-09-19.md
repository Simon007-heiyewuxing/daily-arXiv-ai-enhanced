### [1] [Class-invariant Test-Time Augmentation for Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14420)
*Zhicheng Lin,Xiaolin Wu,Xi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CI-TTA：一种轻量级测试时增强方法，通过弹性和网格形变生成同类别变体，结合置信度引导的过滤聚合预测，在跨域数据集（PACS，Office-Home）上对多种DG算法和骨干网络均有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度模型在分布偏移下性能显著下降，现有方法多依赖多域训练或测试时昂贵的自适应，作者提出一种轻量且通用的测试时增强策略以提高对未见域的泛化能力。

Method: 对每个输入图像生成多个通过弹性变形和网格变形得到的类不变变体；对这些变体进行模型预测，并基于预测置信度过滤掉不可靠的输出；对剩余可靠预测进行聚合得到最终决策。

Result: 在PACS和Office-Home基准上，CI-TTA对不同域泛化算法和网络骨干都带来一致的性能提升，显示出方法的有效性与广泛适用性。

Conclusion: CI-TTA在不需要多域训练或昂贵测试时自适应的情况下，通过生成类不变的图像变体并过滤不可靠预测，能稳定提升域泛化性能，证明了方法的有效性与通用性。

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under
distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this
challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior
approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time
adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight
test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant
Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple
variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that
nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions
are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove
unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and
trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets
demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,
highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

### [2] [AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476)
*Jiasen Lu,Liangchen Song,Mingze Xu,Byeongjoo Ahn,Yanjun Wang,Chen Chen,Afshin Dehghan,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AToken是首个统一的4D视觉tokenizer，通过4D位置编码+无对抗损失和渐进训练，在图像/视频/3D上同时实现高质量重建与语义理解，支持生成与理解多种下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有tokenizer通常只专注于重建或理解，且多为单模态；需要一个统一方案同时兼顾多模态和两类任务。

Method: 采用纯Transformer架构并引入4D旋转位置嵌入，对任意分辨率和时间长度的视觉输入进行编码；训练上使用无对抗的损失（感知损失+Gram矩阵损失）并配合渐进式训练课程，支持连续和离散潜在token。

Result: 在图像上达成0.21 rFID和82.2% ImageNet准确率；视频上3.01 rFVD和32.6% MSRVTT检索；3D上28.19 PSNR和90.9%分类准确率；并能支持图像生成、文本到视频、图像到3D等下游任务。

Conclusion: AToken提出了一个统一的视觉tokenizer，在图像、视频和3D资产上同时兼顾高保真重建和语义理解，具有广泛适用性和竞争性性能。

Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both
high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos,
and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either
reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these
diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and
modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer
architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of
arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we
introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and
Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By
employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from
single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent
tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01
rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9%
classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both
visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete
tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding
tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all
benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI
systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

### [3] [MemEvo: Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14544)
*Zisen Kong,Bo Zhong,Pengyuan Li,Dongxia Chang,Yiming Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MemEvo with hippocampus-inspired view alignment, cognitive forgetting, and prefrontal-like consolidation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Balance plasticity and stability in incremental multi-view clustering inspired by hippocampal-prefrontal cortex

Method: Summarize methods and modules

Result: Improved retention and performance across growing views

Conclusion: MemEvo effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting and outperforms SOTA

Abstract: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results
while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views.
At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity
to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to
consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired
by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in
neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering
method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a
hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information
of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we
introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of
human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we
design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that
leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical
knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge
retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over
existing state-of-the-art methods.

### [4] [Edge-Aware Normalized Attention for Efficient and Detail-Preserving Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14550)
*Penghao Rao,Tieyong Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种将边缘特征与中间激活联合编码以生成自适应调制图的边缘引导注意力模块，结合轻量残差网络和像素/感知/对抗复合损失，在保持参数高效的同时提升超分的结构和感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单幅超分辨率高度病态，恢复高频结构信息存在模糊与二义性。现有边缘感知方法常通过附加边缘先验或注意分支到复杂骨干，但随意融合会带来冗余、不稳定优化或结构增益有限的问题。因此需要一种参数高效且稳定的方法将边缘先验注入网络。

Method: 设计了边缘引导的注意力模块（edge-guided attention），该模块从边缘特征和中间激活联合编码生成调制图，并用于归一化和重加权网络响应。将该模块集成入轻量级残差网络结构，并在训练时采用包含像素级、感知和对抗项的复合损失以平衡保真度、感知真实感与训练稳定性。

Result: 在标准SISR基准上，相较于SRGAN、ESRGAN以及先前的边缘注意力基线，在相当模型复杂度下，所提方法在结构锐度和感知质量上均有持续提升。提出的方法提供了参数高效的边缘注入途径、通过定制多项损失稳定的对抗优化，以及在不依赖更深或过参数化架构下增强边缘保真度。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种边缘引导的注意力机制，通过联合编码边缘特征与中间特征激活，生成自适应调制图以归一化和重加权响应，从而增强结构显著区域并抑制伪纹理，最终提高单图超分辨率的结构清晰度和感知质量。

Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because
recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single
low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often
attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones,
yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or
limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention
mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge
features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and
reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while
suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a
lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining
pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual
realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR
benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and
perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at
comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a
parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial
refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity
without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These
results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation
for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

### [5] [Adaptive and Iterative Point Cloud Denoising with Score-Based Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14560)
*Zhaonan Wang,Manyi Li,ShiQing Xin,Changhe Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于评分（score）扩散的自适应迭代点云去噪框架，通过噪声估计确定自适应步长并结合两阶段采样的网络训练实现特征与梯度融合，显著提升去噪质量与细节保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习点云去噪方法通常需要多次经验性迭代，但缺乏针对不同噪声水平或模式的高效迭代策略；因此需要一个能自适应安排迭代步骤并提高去噪效率与效果的方法。

Method: 基于score-based扩散模型：1) 对输入噪声点云估计噪声变化并确定自适应去噪时间表和步长；2) 训练一个专门的网络并采用两阶段采样策略以支持迭代过程中进行特征融合与梯度融合；3) 按自适应时间表多次迭代调用网络更新点位置以逐步恢复干净点云。

Result: 在合成与真实扫描数据集上，本文方法在定性与定量指标上均优于现有最先进方法，能更好地保留形状边界与细节，同时产出更干净、更平滑的点云，且对不同噪声模式更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于score-based扩散模型的自适应迭代点云去噪方法，通过估计噪声变化制定自适应去噪步长，并设计网络结构与两阶段采样策略以实现特征与梯度融合，从而在保持边界和细节的同时获得更平滑洁净的点云。

Abstract: Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the
scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent
state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point
locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising
process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear
how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with
different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion
model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and
determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then
invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the
adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,
we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the
network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative
denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our
approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the
shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other
methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the
synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the
real-scanned dataset.

### [6] [DiffVL: Diffusion-Based Visual Localization on 2D Maps via BEV-Conditioned GPS Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14565)
*Li Gao,Hongyang Sun,Liu Liu,Yunhao Li,Yang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffVL把视觉定位视为GPS去噪，使用扩散模型在SD地图和BEV视觉特征条件下逐步修正GPS噪声，达到无需HD地图的亚米级定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HD地图成本高、不易扩展的局限，利用普遍可得但有噪的GPS作为先验，与SD地图和图像结合以实现高精度定位。

Method: 提出用扩散模型对有噪GPS轨迹进行迭代修正，条件化输入包含视觉BEV特征和标准定义(SD)地图信息，联合建模GPS、SD地图与视觉信号以逆向恢复真实位姿分布。

Result: 在多数据集上相比BEV匹配基线（如OrienterNet）实现了SOTA精度，证明扩散模型可将噪声GPS转化为可用的定位先验。

Conclusion: DiffVL通过将视觉定位重构为基于扩散模型的GPS去噪任务，展示了在不依赖高精度地图的情况下实现亚米级定位精度的可能性。

Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing
methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide
high-precision localization references, their costly construction and
maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward
standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based
approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and
maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily
available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose
DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS
denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS
trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly
encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative
diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,
OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse
GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,
achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on
multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that
diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a
generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based
methods.

### [7] [DICE: Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium for Sparse-view CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14566)
*Leon Suarez-Rodriguez,Roman Jacome,Romario Gualdron-Hurtado,Ana Mantilla-Dulcey,Henry Arguello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DICE：在扩散模型采样中交替执行数据一致性近端算子与扩散模型先验代理的两代理一致性框架，显著提升稀疏视角CT重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视角CT下采样导致的反问题极不适定，传统迭代方法难以捕捉医学图像复杂结构；扩散模型作为强生成先验可更好建模复杂图像分布，因此将其与数据一致性结合有望提升重建质量。

Method: 在每个采样步骤交替执行：用近端算子实现的数据一致性代理（确保与测量匹配）和由扩散模型实现的先验代理（执行去噪/清晰图像估计），通过迭代平衡两者达到一致解。

Result: 在均匀和非均匀15、30、60视角设置下（总180视角），DICE在图像质量上显著优于最先进基线，表现出有效性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DICE通过在扩散模型采样过程中引入两代理一致性平衡（数据一致性代理和先验代理）实现了稀疏视角CT的高质量重建，兼顾了生成先验与测量一致性。

Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally
challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem.
Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to
regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present
in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as
powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image
distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium
(DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the
sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency
agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement
consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image
estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents
iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities
with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images
under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out
of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

*Takamasa Yamaguchi,Brian Kenji Iwana,Ryoma Bise,Shota Harada,Takumi Okuo,Kiyohito Tanaka,Kaito Shiku*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出利用患者级诊断作为弱标签的域自适应方法，采用Shared Aggregation Tokens和Max-Severity Triplet Loss进行类级对齐，显著改善跨域UC严重度评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决UC严重度估计在不同医院因成像设备和临床设置差异导致的域移位问题，同时减少目标域昂贵像素级或区域级标注需求，利用常规记录的患者级诊断作为低成本弱监督信号。

Method: 方法通过引入Shared Aggregation Tokens进行类级分布对齐，并设计Max-Severity Triplet Loss，基于患者级诊断由最严重病灶决定的特性，对样本间的表示进行约束，以实现弱监督下的域自适应。

Result: 在跨域设置中，所提方法在UC严重度估计上显著优于对比的域自适应方法，表明利用患者级弱标签与所设计的聚合和损失函数能够提升目标域的性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于弱监督的域自适应（WSDA）方法，利用患者级诊断结果作为目标域的弱标签，有效缓解了医疗图像中由设备和设置差异引起的域移位问题。实验表明，所提方法在跨域UC严重度估计任务上优于现有域适应方法。

Abstract: The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis
(UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from
domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings
across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed
to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in
the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges,
we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages
patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis,
as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise
distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity
Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses
are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches,
improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

### [9] [Do Vision-Language Models See Urban Scenes as People Do? An Urban Perception Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14574)
*Rashid Mushkani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Created a 100-image urban VLM benchmark with participatory human annotations; VLMs do better on visible objective attributes than subjective ones; best model achieves modest scores; dataset and code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how vision-language models perceive urban scenes and compare them to human annotations for both objective and subjective attributes.

Method: Collected 230 annotation forms from 12 participants over 30 dimensions on 100 images (half real, half synthetic); normalized French to English; evaluated seven VLMs zero-shot using structured prompts and deterministic parsing; used accuracy for single-choice and Jaccard for multi-label; human agreement measured by Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard.

Result: Benchmark of 100 Montreal street images with 230 human annotation forms across 30 dimensions; VLMs evaluated zero-shot, top model macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items; models better at objective properties; synthetic images slightly lower; higher human agreement aligns with better model performance; benchmark released.

Conclusion: VLMs align with humans on observable city-scene features but struggle on subjective appraisals; human agreement predicts model success; benchmark supports reproducible, uncertainty-aware participatory urban analysis.

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We
introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban
perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs
and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community
groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical
attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to
English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt
and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard
overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and
pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,
objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)
reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human
agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower
scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible,
uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

### [10] [Feature-aligned Motion Transformation for Efficient Dynamic Point Cloud Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14591)
*Xuan Deng,Xiandong Meng,Longguang Wang,Tiange Zhang,Xiaopeng Fan,Debin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过用特征对齐替代显式运动向量并引入随机访问参考策略，FMT在压缩率和处理速度上均显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云结构不规则且局部变化大，显式运动估计难以捕捉复杂动态且未充分利用时间相关性，影响压缩效率与处理速度。

Method: 提出Feature-aligned Motion Transformation（FMT），用时空对齐策略在隐空间提供时间上下文，结合条件编码框架；设计随机访问参考策略实现双向参考和分层编码，支持帧级并行压缩。

Result: 相比D-DPCC和AdaDPCC，在编码/解码效率上更优，分别在BD-Rate上降低约20%和9.4%。

Conclusion: FMT通过在潜在空间使用特征对齐替代显式运动向量，有效建模时间连续变化，从而提升动态点云压缩性能与效率。

Abstract: Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive
reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely
depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular
structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task
highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation,
whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully
exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud
compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal
alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using
aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding
framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that
enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby
supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding
efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%,
respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly
improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

### [11] [HybridMamba: A Dual-domain Mamba for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14609)
*Weitong Wu,Zhaohu Xing,Jing Gong,Qin Peng,Lei Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HybridMamba combines axial-traversal and local-adaptive scanning with gated spatial-frequency module to balance global and local context, achieving SOTA on multi-center CT and MRI


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of CNNs for long-range dependencies and Transformer high compute; preserve local structure

Method: Paper analysis

Result: HybridMamba outperforms SOTA on MRI and CT for 3D segmentation; introduces dual mechanisms and new dataset

Conclusion: HybridMamba effectively harmonizes local and global representations, reducing boundary ambiguity and regional distortion, improving 3D medical image segmentation performance

Abstract: In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the
superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range
dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead
associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution
medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling
may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus
leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs.
Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual
complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively
integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to
harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a
gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual
modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer.
Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

### [12] [Enhancing Feature Fusion of U-like Networks with Dynamic Skip Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14610)
*Yue Cao,Quansong He,Kaishen Wang,Jianlong Xiong,Tao He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DSC块：在推理时自适应训练（TTT）+基于上下文的动态多尺度卷积（DMSK），解决传统跳跃连接的静态融合与多尺度建模不足，可无缝应用于各类U-like医学图像分割网络并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-like网络的跳跃连接在特征融合上存在静态路径（inter-feature constraint）且对多尺度内部交互建模不足（intra-feature constraint），限制了对全局语义与局部细节的协同利用，进而影响医学影像分割性能。

Method: 设计了一个可插拔的DSC块，包括两部分：1) TTT模块在推理阶段对隐藏表示进行自适应微调，实现基于内容的特征融合，解决跨层静态信息传递问题；2) DMSK模块基于全局上下文动态选择卷积核大小，实现多尺度特征交互以增强全局上下文聚合能力。该块可嵌入到CNN、Transformer、混合、Mamba等U-like骨干中。

Result: 作者宣称在多种U-like结构（CNN、Transformer、混合、Mamba）上进行广泛实验，证明DSC块作为即插即用模块能带来性能提升，具体数值未在摘要给出。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的动态跳跃连接（DSC）通过测试时训练（TTT）和动态多尺度卷积核（DMSK）模块，有效缓解了传统U结构跳跃连接的跨特征与内特征约束，提升了多尺度上下文整合能力，并且具备架构无关性，能在多种U-like网络上即插即用地带来性能提升。

Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image
segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and
low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections
exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature
constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of
feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is
transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The
intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale
feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global
contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer
connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two
complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module
addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden
representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature
refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the
intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on
global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature
integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly
incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across
CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like
networks.

*Feng Ding,Haisheng Fu,Soroush Oraki,Jie Liang*

TL;DR: LSTC-MDA通过并行长短时卷积与视角受限的加性mixup同时提升时序建模与数据多样性，显著提高骨架动作识别精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决骨架动作识别中标注样本稀缺与短/长时序依赖建模困难

Method: 引入LSTC模块（短期stride-2卷积和长周期分支并行，利用学习到的相似性权重对齐并自适应融合以保留长程信息）; 在数据增强上，将JMDA扩展为输入级加性Mixup并仅在相同摄像头视角内混合以避免分布偏移；通过消融验证各组件有效性

Result: 提出LSTC-MDA框架：LSTC模块（并行长短期分支、相似性加权对齐融合）+扩展JMDA（输入级加性mixup，限制同视角混合），在NTU/NW-UCLA上取得SOTA性能

Conclusion: 并行长短期对齐融合与受限mixup均能提升性能，组合的LSTC-MDA在多个数据集上达SOTA

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the
scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and
long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified
framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data
diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC)
module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches
are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to
preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal
convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an
Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and
restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution
shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves
state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4%
and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 作者构建了包含107K+高质量样本的MultiEdit数据集，覆盖多种复杂编辑任务；数据通过两个MLLM生成指令与编辑图像；经微调后可显著提升模型在复杂编辑上的能力并保留原有性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IBIE方法在复杂编辑任务上表现欠佳，主要原因是数据集编辑类型与样本数量有限，且传统构建的数据集包含噪声图文对，导致偏差与模型能力受限。因此需要更丰富、更高质量的数据集来提升模型能力。

Method: 提出了一个新的数据构建流程，利用两个多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）分别生成视觉自适应的编辑指令和高保真编辑图像，构建包含18种非风格迁移编辑类型和38种风格迁移操作的107K+样本数据集。

Result: 在大量实验中，使用MultiEdit-Train对开源基础模型进行微调，显著提升了模型在作者提出的MultiEdit-Test基准上处理复杂编辑任务的性能，同时在标准编辑基准上的能力得到有效保留。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个大规模、高质量的图像编辑数据集MultiEdit，针对现有指令驱动图像编辑（IBIE）在复杂编辑场景中的不足，扩展了编辑类型与样本数量，从而提升模型在复杂编辑任务上的表现。

Abstract: Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with
challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing
datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains
noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model
capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we
introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality
image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a
diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer
operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex
semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We
employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions
and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our
MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated
editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively
preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe
MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse
and challenging IBIE capabilities. Our dataset is available at

### [15] [Attention Lattice Adapter: Visual Explanation Generation for Visual Foundation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14664)
*Shinnosuke Hirano,Yuiga Wada,Tsumugi Iida,Komei Sugiura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ALA and AEA to generate better visual explanations and partially update model parameters; achieves large empirical improvements on standard datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing explanation methods lack adaptability to complex visual foundation models and produce suboptimal attention maps; need a method that can both generate explanations and fine-tune parts of the model for better interpretability.

Method: Introduce Attention Lattice Adapter (ALA) to avoid manual layer selection and allow adaptable explanation generation; use Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA) to update ALA parameters every other epoch to prevent tiny attention regions; evaluate with IoU, insertion/deletion metrics.

Result: Outperforms baselines on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S across mean IoU, insertion, deletion, and combined metrics; best model shows +53.2 mean IoU on CUB-200-2011 versus baselines.

Conclusion: The paper proposes ALA and AEA to generate visual explanations and partially update parameters, improving interpretability and addressing small attention regions; experiments on CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S show significant gains, especially a large IoU improvement on CUB.

Abstract: In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in
visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose;
however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of
adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation
generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating
explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance
interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention
Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism
simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus
enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA
mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively
addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our
method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results
showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean
intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and
insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets.
Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

*Kazuma Nagata,Naoshi Kaneko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DACoN用基础模型与CNN特征融合，并支持任意多参考图，显著提升线稿自动上色的鲁棒性与效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在处理遮挡、姿态和视角变化时表现欠佳；为提升对部件级语义的理解以增强鲁棒性，提出引入基础模型来捕捉线稿中的语义信息。

Method: 利用基础模型提取低分辨率的部件级语义特征，并与CNN提取的高分辨率空间特征融合；摒弃Multiplex Transformer的数量限制，设计可接受任意数量参考图像的融合机制，用以进行颜色迁移与生成。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中，采用多参考图像的DACoN在色彩一致性和细节恢复上优于现有方法，证明了多参考融合策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了DACoN框架，通过融合基础模型的语义特征与CNN的高分辨率空间特征，实现对线稿的细粒度且鲁棒的自动上色，支持任意数量参考图像，实验表明多参考图像能提升上色性能。

Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the
labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including
image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy
but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To
address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages
foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our
method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with
high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature
extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex
Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this
constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images,
achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available

TL;DR: 提出Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting与基础模型知识蒸馏的结合，通过选择性梯度隔离解决多模态目标冲突，在单目视频重建高保真可动画人体头像上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目视频本身几何信息不足，传统3D高斯喷溅自由形状难保表面细节；大规模基础模型包含丰富多模态先验，可弥补信息缺失，但直接蒸馏会产生不同模态间的优化冲突，需要新的训练协调策略。

Method: 1) Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting：将2D高斯基元附着到模板网格面，位置/旋转/位移受限以对齐表面。2) 利用大规模基础模型（如Sapiens）提供多模态先验，并在共享规范空间中进行蒸馏。3) 协调训练策略：对不同损失采用选择性梯度隔离，按任务敏感参数分配更新，避免互相干扰。

Result: FMGS-Avatar 提出了一种将2D高斯基元与模板网格面绑定的网格引导2D高斯喷溅表示，并结合大规模基础模型的多模态先验，通过选择性梯度隔离的协调训练策略进行蒸馏，从而在单目视频驱动的人体头像重建中显著提升几何精度和外观保真度。

Conclusion: 网格约束的2D高斯基元能更好地保留表面细节；从大规模基础模型蒸馏的多模态先验可补充单目视频信息；选择性梯度隔离的协调训练策略能避免多目标冲突，提升收敛与性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos
remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view
observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,
they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of
3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and
information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that
integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian
Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh
faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior
surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage
foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to
complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when
distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting
optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct
parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training
strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to
optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination
of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our
approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared
to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance
fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled
prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and
temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法只在评估阶段使用MLLM，未将其强大的多模态推理能力直接用于排序，导致检索性能受限。CoTRR旨在将MLLM纳入排序环节以充分利用其推理能力。

Method: 设计了列表式重排序提示（listwise ranking prompt）让MLLM对候选图像进行整体排序；辅以图像评价提示来逐项评分候选与查询的匹配程度；引入查询拆分提示将复杂查询分解为多语义子项以支持细粒度分析和一致推理。

Result: 在五个数据集上，CoTRR在文本-图像检索、组合图像检索和聊天式图像检索三类任务上均实现了SOTA性能，证明了方法的有效性与通用性。

Conclusion: CoTRR能有效利用MLLM的多模态推理能力进行候选图像的列表式重排序，提升图像检索准确性并提供可解释的推理过程，实验证明在多项检索任务上达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer
vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ
them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking
process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain
underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.
Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly
participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in
an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with
users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method
supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable
decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To
enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query
deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple
semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR),
composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our
code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史艺术品中气味相关对象识别受风格变化、细粒度类别需求和标注稀缺的挑战，手工标注成本高且数据不平衡，故探索合成数据以降低标注需求并改善模型泛化。

Method: 采用多种基于扩散模型的增强策略生成合成图像，将这些合成样本与真实标注数据混合用于训练检测模型；并评估不同合成数据配比与规模对检测性能的影响，强调利用扩散模型的大规模预训练特性。

Result: 实验表明在使用合成扩充后，目标检测性能提升明显；即使在数据量较小的情况下也有效，且随着合成数据规模扩大性能有进一步提高潜力。

Conclusion: 该论文提出使用合成数据（基于扩散模型）来缓解历史艺术品中气味相关对象检测中的注释稀疏与类别不平衡问题，证明了将合成数据加入训练可提升检测性能，尤其在标注稀缺的小众任务上效果显著。

Abstract: Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem.
Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their
recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in
annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the
potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable
accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several
diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating
synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our
findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion
models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy,
particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to
obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with
relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for
further enhancements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基准中，模型通常使用各自不同的帧选择策略，导致评测结果受帧采样偏差影响，无法公平比较视觉语言模型。

Method: 在受控的帧采样策略下，对多款小型VLM进行系统化评测，比较模型视觉表示能力与帧采样方法对任务表现的共同影响，并公开了基准代码以保证可复现性。

Result: 实验证实存在帧采样偏差，并展示了SVLM在不同采样策略下表现出数据集和任务特有的行为差异；提供了可复现的、不偏倚的评测协议。

Conclusion: 本文提出了首个对小型视觉语言模型（SVLM）进行帧级准确评估的视频问答基准，表明不同帧采样策略会显著影响模型性能，存在采样偏差。

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the
performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation
capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current
video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias,
as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this
work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small
VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling
strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both
data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different
frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide
the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video
VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored
to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

*Yuan Gao,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 结合GMM分割、平面合并与B样条拟合，提出实时多模型参数化点云表示，在精度和速度上较GMM和现有方法均有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在表示能力与实时性之间存在权衡：高适应性模型（如样条曲面）拟合精确但计算开销大；实时方法（如GMM、平面）计算快但自由度低，难以用少量基元达到高精度。作者希望兼顾二者优点。

Method: 首先用高斯混合模型对点云进行聚类分割；然后识别并合并平面簇，使用2D体素边界描述对平面进行拟合与截断；对有曲率的簇拟合B样条曲面，并用相同的边界描述方法进行边界刻画。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，提出的方法比现有最先进方法更鲁棒，效率提升约3.78倍；相比单纯GMM表示，精度提高约2倍；在低功耗机载计算平台上可达36.4 fps。

Conclusion: 提出了一种多模型参数化表示方法，结合GMM分割、平面合并与B样条曲面拟合，兼顾实时性与高拟合精度。

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely
applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot
collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are
computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time
methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of
freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this
problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface
detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is
first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat
clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be
easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.
Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary
description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public
datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the
state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.
Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian
mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用高梯度补丁+CLIP聚类+扩散模型微调合成蒸馏样本，无需标签或预训练SR模型，能用极少数据训练出接近原性能的SR模型且显著节省时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度网络复杂度提高，训练对大数据和算力的需求急剧上升，单图像超分任务尤其依赖大规模训练集。现有基于GAN反演的数据蒸馏方法依赖预训练SR网络和类别信息，限制了通用性，因此需要一种更通用、高效的数据蒸馏策略。

Method: 先从数据集中提取高梯度图像补丁并基于CLIP特征进行聚类筛选，然后在选定补丁上微调扩散生成模型以学习其分布，最后由扩散模型生成蒸馏样本用于训练SR网络。该流程不依赖类别标签或预训练SR模型。

Result: 实验证明该方法在用极少（如0.68%）原始数据训练时，仅带来约0.3dB的性能下降，同时大幅缩短扩散微调（约4小时）和SR训练（约1小时）总时长，相比使用完整数据（11小时）效率显著提升，且在若干基准上达到或超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种无须类别标签和预训练SR模型的数据蒸馏方法，通过高梯度补丁提取、CLIP特征聚类和扩散模型微调来合成蒸馏训练图像，从而在显著减少训练数据和计算开销的同时保持或接近基线SR性能。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring
large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model
complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data
efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field
of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training
datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative
adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR
was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the
current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific
information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these
issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does
not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract
high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then
fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution
and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less
training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we
train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original
dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model
fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much
shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对文本提示过于简化，忽视完整放射报告中的丰富临床语义，导致文本-图像对齐和临床保真度不足；因此希望利用完整报告提高生成CT的临床一致性与细节保留。

Method: 在20000例CT体积的CT RATE数据集上训练3D潜在扩散模型，使用三个预训练医学文本编码器（BiomedVLP CXR BERT、MedEmbed、ClinicalBERT）对放射学报告（包括findings和impression）及体素间距进行多编码器条件融合，并采用classifier-free guidance优化文本图像对齐。

Result: 生成的CT在FID和CLIP等评估指标上优于GenerateCT，表现出很好的解剖一致性和文本-图像语义对齐；多编码器条件提高了CLIP分数，classifier-free guidance进一步增强对齐性但对FID影响较小，并在VLM3D挑战赛中获得SOTA。

Conclusion: 提出了Report2CT，一个基于放射报告条件的3D潜在扩散模型，能从完整放射学报告生成解剖一致的胸部CT体积，且在MICCAI 2025 VLM3D挑战赛中排名第一。

Abstract: Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image
synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing
approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in
full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical
fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion
framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text
radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using
multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text
encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced
clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a
3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.
Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real
synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic
alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against
GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with
excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning
improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical
details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further
enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the
VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved
state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging
complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT
advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality
synthetic data.

TL;DR: 通过结合强度与梯度的新边缘探测与将骨折提示嵌入的自适应步长，提出一款针对骨折鲁棒的交互式地质主动轮廓分割算法，能有效减少软组织干扰并提升骨折区域分割准确性与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地质主动轮廓因特征提取不够区分性，容易受软组织干扰导致边缘阻塞、泄漏及骨折区域分割失败，需要结合骨科先验改善分割鲁棒性。

Method: 基于地质主动轮廓（geodesic active contour），设计新边缘检测函数（结合强度与梯度模）以区分骨组织与软组织；引入距离信息作为自适应步长，将骨折提示嵌入轮廓演化以稳定收敛并在骨折处停驻，以实现交互式骨折处理。

Result: 在髋骨与踝骨数据集上，方法在骨边缘及骨折区域分割准确率与稳定性上优于传统模型，能通过交互提示提高骨折区域精度，展现良好泛化潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能有效应对边缘阻塞、边缘泄漏和骨折区域分割困难，实验证明在髋骨和踝骨分割上表现准确、稳定且一致，具有推广到其他骨骼的潜力。

Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually
limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle
the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we
propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for
bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly
to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic
knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the
intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges
without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces
mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can
be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size
to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and
fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and
improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned
problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a
broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides
insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

Conclusion: 该论文通过提出最小能量变形（MED）损失，作为变形轨迹的正则项，改善了基于学习的皮质表面重建模型在训练稳定性和可重现性方面的表现，同时保持了重建精度和拓扑正确性。

Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the
cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based
CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions
through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However,
ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy
and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this
work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a
regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used
Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and
demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training
consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and
topological correctness.

Method: 采用基于原型的神经网络架构（prototype-based），将图像与结构化病史特征融合，训练过程中学习代表性原型（影像块和记录模式），并通过原型匹配机制给出决策依据；评估在4160例NHS真实病例上，比较了仅视觉输入与多模态输入的性能。

Result: 在4160名真实NHS患者数据上，视觉仅模型达87.58%准确率，多模态ProtoMedX达89.8%，均优于已有发表的方法，并能生成可被临床医生直观理解的原型可视化解释。

Conclusion: 本文提出的ProtoMedX是一种可解释的多模态骨健康分类模型，结合腰椎DEXA影像与病人记录，能够在保持或超越现有精度的同时提供直观的可视化原型解释，适合临床场景与法规需求。

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection
and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a
diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The
applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods
rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and
focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and
left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a
multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient
records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design,
which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the
upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions,
including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be
visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients,
the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8%
in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

*Miriam Louise Carnot,Jonas Kunze,Erik Fastermann,Eric Peukert,André Ludwig,Bogdan Franczyk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MapAnything：利用Metric Depth Estimation和相机几何将单张图像中的对象定位到地理坐标，评估显示在短距离和可视场景下效果良好，但受深度误差与遮挡等因素限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市管理需要维护包含地理坐标的对象数据库（如交通标志、树木、路损等）；人工更新成本高，且随着数字化需求增加，需要自动化、可用单张图像估计位置的模块。

Method: 采用先进的Metric Depth Estimation模型预测像素级深度，结合相机内参、相机姿态和几何关系将目标像素的深度转为相对相机坐标，再转换为地理坐标；评估中用城市LiDAR点云作为参考，按距离区间和语义区域（道路、植被等）分析误差。

Result: 在实验中MapAnything在近距离（例如0–10m）对交通标志和路面破损的距离估计较为准确，误差随距离增加而增大；在道路语义区域误差低于植被等复杂区域。实际用例显示可将检测到的交通标志与数据库坐标近似匹配并标注路损位置。

Conclusion: MapAnything能通过单张图像和Metric Depth Estimation估算物体地理坐标，对城市对象与事件的自动化映射有实际价值，但受深度估计精度、相机参数和场景遮挡等限制。

Abstract: To maintain an overview of urban conditions, city administrations manage
databases of objects like traffic signs and trees, complete with their
geocoordinates. Incidents such as graffiti or road damage are also relevant. As
digitization increases, so does the need for more data and up-to-date
databases, requiring significant manual effort. This paper introduces
MapAnything, a module that automatically determines the geocoordinates of
objects using individual images. Utilizing advanced Metric Depth Estimation
models, MapAnything calculates geocoordinates based on the object's distance
from the camera, geometric principles, and camera specifications. We detail and
validate the module, providing recommendations for automating urban object and
incident mapping. Our evaluation measures the accuracy of estimated distances
against LiDAR point clouds in urban environments, analyzing performance across
distance intervals and semantic areas like roads and vegetation. The module's
effectiveness is demonstrated through practical use cases involving traffic
signs and road damage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有泛化超分辨方法普遍假设模型会对所有退化类型过拟合，但本文发现模型实际主要对噪声过拟合，因此需要一个针对噪声的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一个可插拔的特征去噪框架，包括噪声检测模块和去噪模块，可无缝融入现有超分辨网络而无需修改结构。

Result: 在五个传统基准和数据集（含合成与真实场景）上，提出的方法优于之前基于正则化的泛化方法。

Conclusion: 本文结论是：图像超分辨模型在面对未知退化时主要倾向于对噪声过拟合，而针对性地进行特征去噪能显著提升模型的通用化性能。

Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization
capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are
expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting
degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature
Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit
degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have
assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG),
while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models
predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct
degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we
propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and
denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be
seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring
architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance
compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional
benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 验证arXiv:2311.17983关于DDS提升ViT解释性鲁棒性的主张，并评估将DDS添加到任意解释方法上的普适性，同时量化其计算与环境成本。

Method: 重现FViTs的训练与评估；复现并对比ViT解释方法（如attention-based方法、Attribution Rollout）并与DDS结合；在分割与分类任务上测试对抗与扰动鲁棒性；测量计算成本与碳足迹。

Result: 总体结果与原文一致：DDS在多种场景下能提升解释图的鲁棒性；但在部分设置（如某些攻击类型或基准方法）上性能提升不显著，且计算与能耗成本显著增加。

Conclusion: 总体可复现，但存在细微差异需要讨论。

Abstract: This work aims to reproduce the results of Faithful Vision Transformers
(FViTs) proposed by arXiv:2311.17983 alongside interpretability methods for
Vision Transformers from arXiv:2012.09838 and Xu (2022) et al. We investigate
claims made by arXiv:2311.17983, namely that the usage of Diffusion Denoised
Smoothing (DDS) improves interpretability robustness to (1) attacks in a
segmentation task and (2) perturbation and attacks in a classification task. We
also extend the original study by investigating the authors' claims that adding
DDS to any interpretability method can improve its robustness under attack.
This is tested on baseline methods and the recently proposed Attribution
Rollout method. In addition, we measure the computational costs and
environmental impact of obtaining an FViT through DDS. Our results broadly
agree with the original study's findings, although minor discrepancies were
found and discussed.

Motivation: 减轻大参数模型和单次VLM表征的局限，通过多智能体协同获取互补视觉信息，提高分类准确性与解释性。

Method: 1) Outliner Agent分析图像全局主题并生成提示；2) 三个Aspect Agents基于提示提取不同视觉维度的细粒度描述；3) Reasoning Agent在整合反思步骤中合成输出并进行分类。

Result: MARIC提出了一种多智能体协同推理框架，将图像分类任务分解为主题概述、多个细粒度维度描述及最终整合推理。

Conclusion: MARIC通过多视角分解与反思式整合显著提升了图像分类表现，并增强可解释性，适用于多类基准数据集。

Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model
training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to
achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)
alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on
single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of
visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for
Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image
classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an
Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted
prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained
descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent
synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,
producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly
decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective
synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training
and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification
benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and
interpretable image classification.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于潜在扩散模型的可控人像去标识化方法，通过在反向去噪中加入自适应属性引导实现精确属性对齐，并支持局部化操作，无需额外训练，在公开数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人像图像在计算机视觉中的广泛应用，保护个人身份变得重要，同时去标识化后的图像仍需对下游任务有用。现有方法要么牺牲视觉真实性，要么无法精确控制属性，因此需要一种可控且真实的去标识化方法。

Method: 利用预训练的潜在扩散模型进行图像修补（inpainting），在反向扩散步骤中加入自适应属性引导（attribute-guidance）模块，基于属性差异对梯度进行校正，控制生成图像的人脸属性与合成目标一致；支持通过掩码实现局部去标识化。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了基于潜在扩散模型的可控人像去标识化框架，通过引入自适应属性引导模块，在反向去噪过程中对梯度进行校正，实现生成图像与目标合成图像在人脸属性上的对齐，同时支持局部化去标识化以保留指定区域。该方法无需额外训练，且在CelebA-HQ和FFHQ数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to
protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain
useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified
framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to
generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete
control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive
attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse
denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with
those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized
anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left
unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while
requiring no additional model training. The source code is available on our

Method: 构建多任务模型学习影像外观和时间连续性，生成潜在空间中的纵向轨迹，在线性分类器上进行pCR预测；在ISPY-2数据集上评估不同时间点组合的预测性能。

Result: Latent-space trajectories from longitudinal MRI enable pCR prediction; linear classifier achieves balanced accuracy 0.761 (T0), 0.811 (T0+T1), 0.861 (T0->T3).

Conclusion: 学习潜在轨迹的多任务模型能表征外观、保持时间连续性并处理非应答者异质性，从而提高pCR预测；性能随时间点增加而提升。

Abstract: Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual
response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and
response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to
learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging
data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients
undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent
space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task
model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the
comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the
publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory
space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0),
0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points
(T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 数据驱动的航天器位姿估计方法在真实任务中难以被采纳，主要是因为缺乏对其决策依据的可解释性。作者旨在通过可视化网络依赖的三维线索来提升可解释性和可信度。

Method: 通过将NeRF-based图像生成器与位姿估计网络连接，利用从位姿网络反向传播的梯度来训练生成器，使其渲染出位姿网络所重视的3D特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够恢复出与位姿估计相关的关键三维线索，并揭示监督方式与网络隐式目标表示之间的关系。

Conclusion: 该方法能够可视化数据驱动航天器位姿估计器所依赖的主要3D视觉线索，从而增加其决策过程的可解释性。

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e.,
position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While
data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their
adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their
decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues
on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based
image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation
network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited
by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our
method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional
insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision
and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Conclusion: 伪标签训练+多模型级联推理可显著提高复杂长视频对象分割的准确性与稳定性，适用于挑战性VOS场景

Abstract: Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in
accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of
small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex
interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during
training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework
to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with
existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is
employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC
model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded
decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting
the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC.
Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our
approach achieves a J\&F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points
over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS
Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video
segmentation scenarios.

*Tahar Chettaoui,Naser Damer,Fadi Boutros*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning CLIP for FR/MAD/PAD boosts task performance but causes over-specialization and reduced zero-shot transfer; larger models mitigate forgetting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify trade-offs between specialized fine-tuning for biometric tasks and loss of foundation model generalization/cross-domain transfer abilities.

Method: Evaluated three CLIP variants fine-tuned separately for FR, MAD, and PAD; tested these and original CLIP on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and linear-probe protocols, plus standard FR/MAD/PAD benchmarks. Compared backbones (ViT-L vs smaller) and classification head designs (multi-class vs binary).

Result: Fine-tuned models, especially FR with multi-class heads, show significant forgetting on general datasets (e.g., ViT-L FR improved IJB-C by up to 58.52% but dropped on ImageNetV2 to 51.63% vs baseline 69.84%). Larger CLIP models preserve generalization more than smaller ones.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning CLIP for specialized biometric tasks improves task-specific performance but causes over-specialization and catastrophic forgetting, reducing general vision transfer. Larger architectures retain generalization better.

Abstract: Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and
few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when
fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),
morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these
models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their
foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we
systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP
fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the
original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and
linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our
results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,
especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed
out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.
binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The
FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the
large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.
However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching
only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,
the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's
original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that
increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

Motivation: 现有检测器多只给出二元或概率输出，缺乏解释性；而MLLM可解释但分类性能不足，故需结合两者优势提升准确性与可解释性。

Method: 从多模态大模型（MLLM）中提取隐含判别知识，并通过设计的提示(prompt)注入到训练流程中，使LLaVA学习并利用这些潜在特征进行鉴定。

Result: 在多种合成图像检测任务上，DF-LLaVA在准确率上超过专家模型，同时保持MLLM的可解释输出，实验验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: DF-LLaVA在保持可解释性的同时，显著提升了合成图像检测的准确性，可替代或超越传统专家模型。

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image
authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human
interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models
primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing
only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory
insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods
can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in
terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose
DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic
discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge
from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows
LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while
still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments
confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and
explainability in synthetic image detection. Code is available online at:

Motivation: 现有方法在极端数据稀缺下受几何失配和纹理偏差影响严重，导致语义模糊和灾难性遗忘，需增强几何可信度并抑制纹理偏差以稳定增量学习。

Method: 结构感知几何校正：利用注意力驱动的几何融合将3D部件结构与CLIP中间空间先验逐层对齐；纹理放大：合成最小但判别性强的纹理以抑制噪声并强化跨模态一致性；基类-新类判别器：隔离几何变异以稳定增量原型。

Conclusion: CMGR在跨域和域内设置下均显著提高了3D少样本类增量学习性能，提供更稳健的决策原型与几何保真度。

Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition
systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental
learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric
misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with
2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by
texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural
cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To
address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a
framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical
spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric
Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's
intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.
Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet
discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal
consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a
Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot
class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and
robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent hierarchical brain network topology due to spatial constraints and high distortion; hyperbolic space naturally captures hierarchies with low distortion.

Method: Proposes Brain-HGCN using Lorentz model hyperbolic geometry, a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with signed aggregation for excitatory/inhibitory edges, and Fréchet mean readout for graph-level representation.

Result: On two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric disorder classification, Brain-HGCN significantly outperforms multiple state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines.

Conclusion: Paper concludes that hyperbolic geometry effectively models hierarchical brain networks from fMRI and improves psychiatric disorder classification over Euclidean GNNs.

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive
window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex
functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit
a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due
to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent
these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical
performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric
deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the
intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network
hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs
a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to
distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning
robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for
graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric
disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new
geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RoboEye用两阶段的2D+按需3D重排序策略和基于关键点的3D匹配，在仅用RGB的条件下显著提升大规模电商商品识别的准确性与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对电商目录爆炸性增长导致的类内差异、长尾稀有样本、包装多样性、遮挡和大视角变化，单纯2D外观特征性能下降，需要在部署成本可控前提下引入3D感知以提升识别鲁棒性。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段用大视觉模型提取2D语义特征并生成候选排名；引入轻量3D质量评估器决定是否触发第二阶段重排序；第二阶段的Robot 3D Retrieval Transformer包含几何感知密集3D特征提取器与基于关键点的匹配器，生成关键点对应置信度进行重排序。

Result: 在公开评测中，RoboEye在Recall@1上比前沿方法RoboLLM提升了7.1%，且仅使用RGB图像，降低了对显式3D输入的依赖与部署成本。

Conclusion: RoboEye通过结合大视野2D特征与轻量级3D推理模块，在保持仅用RGB输入的同时显著提升了商品识别性能，尤其在复杂部署场景下表现优于前沿方法。

Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce
makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses
substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and
a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with
diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large
viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and
reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely
on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification
framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D
reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the
first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for
generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then
estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,
preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When
invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a
3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a
keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences
between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity
scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior
state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,
avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. The code

*Xuanhua Yin,Dingxin Zhang,Yu Feng,Shunqi Mao,Jianhui Yu,Weidong Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合结构化网格掩码与注意力驱动语义掩码的双流掩码策略，并通过课程学习动态协调，两者可无缝集成至现有旋转不变点云MAE，在线性评估基准上显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变MAE使用随机掩码忽略了点云的空间关系与语义部件一致性，导致难以捕获跨角度保持不变的结构和语义信息，影响表征学习效果。

Method: 方法包括两条互补的掩码流：1) 3D空间网格掩码（Grid Masking）：对点云坐标进行排序并划分网格，生成结构化掩码以保留跨旋转不变的几何关系；2) 渐进语义掩码（Progressive Semantic Masking）：基于注意力驱动的聚类发现语义部件，并在掩码过程中保持这些部件的连贯性。通过课程学习以动态权重从几何理解过渡到语义发现，两者作为即插即用模块集成到现有旋转不变框架。

Result: 在ModelNet40、ScanObjectNN和OmniObject3D数据集的多个旋转情景下，与基线旋转不变方法相比，提出的方法稳定提升性能，显示出显著的性能增益。

Conclusion: 提出的双流掩码策略通过结合3D空间网格掩码与渐进语义掩码，有效弥补了随机掩码忽略几何结构与语义一致性的缺陷，从而提升旋转不变点云MAE的表示能力。

Abstract: Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on
random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic
coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture
spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic
object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a
dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive
Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates
structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric
relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic
masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful
parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams
are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing
from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play
components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant
frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across
different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN,
and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation
scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline
rotation-invariant methods.

TL;DR: EchoVLM：基于MoE的超声专用视-语模型，覆盖七个解剖区，能做报告生成/诊断/VQA，在报告生成上明显优于通用模型，具备临床应用潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规超声诊断依赖医生经验，主观性强且效率低；通用视觉-语言模型在超声医学任务上知识有限、跨器官泛化差和多任务效率低。设计EchoVLM旨在弥补这些不足，提高自动化和准确性。

Method: 提出EchoVLM，采用Mixture of Experts架构并在涵盖七个解剖区域的超声数据上训练，以支持多任务（报告生成、诊断、视觉问答）；与Qwen2-VL比较，使用BLEU-1与ROUGE-1评价指标进行性能验证。

Result: 在超声报告生成任务上，EchoVLM相比Qwen2-VL在BLEU-1上提升10.15点，在ROUGE-1上提升4.77点；整体实验表明EchoVLM在多器官病变识别和多任务诊断上表现优异。

Conclusion: EchoVLM是一种专为超声医学影像设计的视觉-语言模型，通过专家混合（MoE）架构和跨七个解剖区域的数据训练，实现多任务诊断（报告生成、诊断、VQA），在超声报告生成任务上优于通用模型，显示出提升超声诊断准确性的潜力。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer
screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and
real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis
heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high
subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer
promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models
demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor
generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across
multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a
vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The
model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning
seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple
tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual
question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM
achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and
ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report
generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential
to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a
viable technical solution for future clinical applications. Source code and
model weights are available at https://github.com/Asunatan/EchoVLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内环境高保真三维建模耗时且难以自动化的问题，克服现有生成方法在视觉质量、多样性、语义一致性和用户控制之间的权衡，并补足缺乏大规模高质量数据集的瓶颈。

Method: 基于新数据集训练的多视角多模态扩散模型（SpatialGen），输入为3D布局和参考图（由文本生成），输出包括颜色渲染、场景坐标图和语义分割图，强调跨模态空间一致性和任意视角合成；并通过与既有方法比较验证其优势。

Result: 构建了包含12,328个结构化注释场景、57,440间房和4.7M光照真实渲染图的大规模合成数据集；提出SpatialGen，一种多视角多模态扩散模型，能在给定三维布局和参考图像（来自文本提示）下，从任意视角生成颜色图、场景坐标图和语义分割图，并在模态间保持空间一致性；在实验中优于现有方法，并且将数据和模型开源。

Conclusion: 通过高质量数据集与多模态扩散模型相结合，可以有效生成真实且语义一致的三维室内场景，推动室内场景理解与生成研究。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for
applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D
modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in
generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often
face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency,
and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality
dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a
comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes
with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this
dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model
that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a
3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model
synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and
semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while
preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently
generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are
open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the
field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

*Arda Kabadayi,Senem Velipasalar,Jiajing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM narrows search via SigLIP, cleans images with YOLO-E, then refines with LightGlue for accurate, fast retail product retrieval


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address product retrieval challenges: subtle local differences, viewpoint variation, and efficiency

Method: Hybrid retrieval combining CLIP-like models and pixel matching

Result: Three-stage PRISM: SigLIP retrieval (top-35), YOLO-E segmentation, LightGlue pixel matching; improves ABV top-1 by 4.21% and remains real-time

Conclusion: Hybrid pipeline balances speed and fine-grained accuracy, outperforming SOTA on ABV dataset

Abstract: Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail
settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different
brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be
taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored
catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to
distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching
methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur
prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid
method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging
the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching
approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval
accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)
is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products
from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a
segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)
fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the
filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination
between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual
cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset
show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval
methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of
real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

Abstract: In the realm of fully autonomous drones, the accurate detection of obstacles
is paramount to ensure safe navigation and prevent collisions. Among these
challenges, the detection of wires stands out due to their slender profile,
which poses a unique and intricate problem. To address this issue, we present
an innovative solution in the form of a monocular end-to-end model for wire
segmentation and depth estimation. Our approach leverages a temporal
correlation layer trained on synthetic data, providing the model with the
ability to effectively tackle the complex joint task of wire detection and
depth estimation. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over
existing competitive approaches in the joint task of wire detection and depth
estimation. Our results underscore the potential of our model to enhance the
safety and precision of autonomous drones, shedding light on its promising

TL;DR: 本文在水下成像合成中加入前向散射和非均匀介质，并提供受控浊度下的BUCKET真实数据集，显著提升了高浊度场景的合成真实感，主观评估选择率82.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作多关注颜色失真，但常忽略前向散射及非均匀介质导致的能见度随距离衰减，在高浊度场景下无法真实再现水下成像效果，因此需要更精细的合成模型来生成更真实的训练/测试数据。

Method: 提出一种改进的合成数据生成流程：在传统水下成像模型基础上加入前向散射项，并允许介质属性在空间上非均匀变化；同时采集BUCKET数据集，在受控浊度条件下拍摄真实浊水视频并提供参考图像，用于评估模型。

Result: 在人为设置的不同浊度条件下，与参考模型相比，改进模型在视觉质量上表现更好，在主观调查中参与者选择改进模型生成图像的比例为82.5%。同时公开了数据和代码以便复现。

Conclusion: 本文通过在水下图像生成模型中引入前向散射项和非均匀介质，改进了合成数据管线，从而更好地模拟高浊度环境下的距离依赖能见度损失。

Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use
in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus
on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's
ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in
highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data
generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term,
while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the
BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid
footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate
qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under
increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

TL;DR: 提出面向缺失模态的脑肿瘤分割方法 AdaMM，结合图引导细化、双瓶颈蒸馏与病灶先验模块，通过知识蒸馏显著提升单/弱模态下的分割性能，在 BraTS 数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床中常见缺失模态使得依赖完整多模输入的深度学习模型鲁棒性差，需设计针对缺模场景的分割方法以提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出 AdaMM 框架，包括：1) 图引导自适应细化模块（显式建模通用与模态特异性特征间的语义关联）；2) 双瓶颈蒸馏模块（通过全局风格匹配与对抗特征对齐，将结构与纹理知识从教师传递给学生）；3) 病灶存在引导可靠性模块（通过辅助分类预测病灶类型先验，抑制不完整输入下的假阳性）。

Result: 在 BraTS 2018 与 2024 数据集上大量实验表明 AdaMM 在分割准确性与鲁棒性上持续优于现有方法，尤其在单模态与弱模态组合下有明显提升；并系统评估了六类缺模策略，确认知识蒸馏方法的优越性。

Conclusion: AdaMM 在缺失模态场景下通过知识蒸馏和三模快组合提高了脑肿瘤分割的鲁棒性和准确性，尤其在单模态和弱模态配置中表现优越，并在两个 BraTS 数据集上验证优于现有方法。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation
and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability
to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in
clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and
generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete
inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,
we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for
missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of
three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module
explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and
modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The
Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge
from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial
feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior
probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,
effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive
experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM
consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation
accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality
configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six
categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of
knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and
future research. Our source code is available at

Conclusion: 该论文把超参搜索问题转化为在扩散去噪过程中的序贯决策，通过强化学习自动调整编辑超参数，从而避免暴力穷举，提升效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image
editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in
hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these
methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent
hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification,
\textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge
hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's
hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion
denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework,
which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts
hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a
reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy
optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations.
Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational
overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical
deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

TL;DR: 在仅用合成数据＋域随机化训练YOLOv11检测汤罐任务中，增加数据多样性（多视角与复杂背景）与精细增强最关键；合成指标并不能可靠预测真实表现；最佳YOLOv11l模型在Kaggle隐藏集上mAP@50=0.910，证明合成训练可行但仍有局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成到真实域的差距，目标是在不使用真实训练标注的情况下训练出能在现实中检测特定物体（汤罐）的模型。

Method: 使用YOLOv11架构（最终为YOLOv11l规模）在仅合成数据上训练，系统性试验数据增强策略、数据集组成（视角多样性、复杂背景）、以及模型规模；通过合成验证集、人工目视评估和手工标注的真实测试集进行评估，并提交Kaggle隐藏测试集获取最终mAP@50。

Result: 最优配置为扩展且多样化的合成数据集加上精调的数据增强，使用YOLOv11l达到Kaggle隐藏测试集mAP@50=0.910；同时强调合成验证性能并不总是预示真实表现，仍存在难以覆盖的真实世界变异性问题。

Conclusion: 使用合成数据并配合域随机化及合理的数据增强，可以在很大程度上缩小synthetic-to-real差距，但合成验证指标不能可靠预测真实世界表现，需结合真实标注测试与人工查看；最佳方案是扩展多样化数据集并使用YOLOv11l取得了0.910的mAP@50。

Abstract: This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection,
focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can)
using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology
involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,
and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,
they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,
models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of
predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to
guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle
competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,
specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined
with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain
gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded
and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's
hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only
training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully
capturing real-world variability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: assess model performance across disease severity, pathologies, and lung sides to identify limits for preoperative planning in lung transplantation

Method: retrospective evaluation of 3 DL lung segmentation models on CTs

Result: Unet-R231 best overall; TotalSegmentator second; MedSAM worst. Significant performance drop from mild to moderate-to-severe cases (esp. volumetric similarity). No significant differences between lung sides or pathology types.

Conclusion: 自动分割模型在轻度病变中可用，但在中重度病变需特化训练或人工校正以满足移植术前规划需求。

Abstract: This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation
models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across
disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify
limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung
transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent
chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of
3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected
based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung
segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning
models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using
quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,
Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical
acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and
MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories
(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to
moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),
without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231
provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models
with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined
significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized
model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

Conclusion: Unknown (analysis only)

Abstract: Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of
multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible
pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains
unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework,
termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we
assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt,
which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient
pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different
modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a
universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the
model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the
arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor
achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic
segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER,
SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 仅用单个RGB视频，通过块级跟踪滤波、异常感知联合优化与两阶段策略，本文高效准确地完成动态场景下的相机参数估计，无需运动或其他先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流方法（如COLMAP）在动态场景中受限于长时间运算与对运动掩码等真值先验的依赖，且许多改进需要不可得的额外监督（焦距、3D点云、相机位姿或度量深度），因此需要一种仅用普通视频即可鲁棒估计相机参数的方法。

Method: 方法包括三个核心模块：1) 局部块跟踪滤波（Patch-wise Tracking Filters）用于构建鲁棒且稀疏的铰链式像素关系；2) 异常感知联合优化（Outlier-aware Joint Optimization），通过自适应下调运动异常点权重实现对相机参数的高效估计，无需运动先验；3) 两阶段优化策略，通过在损失中的Softplus限制与凸极小点之间权衡来提升稳定性与收敛速度。

Result: 在NeRF-DS、DAVIS、iPhone、TUM-dynamics和MPI-Sintel等数据集上，本文方法在相机估计精度与速度上均优于对比方法；进一步将估计的相机参数输入4D重建管线，得到更精确的3D场景及渲染的2D RGB和深度图，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种仅依赖单个RGB视频的动态场景相机参数优化方法，实现了更高的精度与效率。

Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter
optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and
reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.
Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as
supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera
poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually
captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate
and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised
by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)
Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse
hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint
Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive
down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A
Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by
a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We
visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate
accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and
assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform
experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)
and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates
camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as
the only supervision.

Abstract: Ensuring factual consistency and reliable reasoning remains a critical
challenge for medical vision-language models. We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a
two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with
reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first
stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external
factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy

self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks,
MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over
previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of

Method: 构造参数化几何错觉合成数据集，将错觉识别任务与ImageNet分类进行多任务/多源学习，比较三种融合策略，在CNN和Transformer上评估性能。

Conclusion: 将视觉错觉作为辅助监督能提升模型的结构敏感性和泛化性。

Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in
image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within
large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly
from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated
inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions
well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification
training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric
geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies
that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification
objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i)
incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically
improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving
intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive
biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered
unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity
of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a
novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new
directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

TL;DR: 该文提出AIP，一种针对RAG系统的对抗性指令提示攻击，通过多样化查询生成与遗传算法联合优化，能在不破坏正常功能下高效且隐蔽地操控检索，实验证明ASR可达95.23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG攻击多依赖操纵用户查询，但实际中用户查询常受限或受保护；而指令性提示被广泛复用且很少审计，具有更可行且隐匿的利用价值，因而成为新的攻击目标。

Method: 提出了多样化查询生成以模拟用户查询的语言变体，结合遗传算法进行联合优化，平衡攻击成功率、干净任务效用和隐蔽性，从而演化出能在多种查询变体下稳健诱导RAG检索行为的对抗性提示。

Result: 实验表明AIP在保持提示原有 benign 功能的同时，可以将ASR提升到95.23%，即高成功率地改变检索结果，暴露了RAG共享指令提示的严重安全隐患。

Conclusion: 该论文揭示了RAG系统中被忽视的攻击面：可重用的指令性提示（instructional prompts），并提出了一种基于遗传算法的对抗性指令提示（AIP）攻击方法，能在不破坏正常功能的情况下高效诱导检索偏移，达到高攻击成功率。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy
and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within
the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have
exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,
which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.
This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional
prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their
implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG
behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that
exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly
altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the
instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface
components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted
to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,
to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across
diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that
simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the
discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.
Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to
evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and
stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR
while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and
previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to
reassess the shared instructional prompts.

Method: 提出了名为M&N的模型无关的渐进式蒸馏与协同训练框架；两个模型互相生成伪掩码并交替训练；引入学习率引导采样，动态调整每批次标注与未标注样本比例以抑制伪掩码带来的负面影响。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效将2D预训练模型的知识逐步迁移到3D医学图像分割任务，提升了半监督设置下的分割性能。

Abstract: This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models
pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We
focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical
images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle
this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills
knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from
scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models
using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning
rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and
unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction
accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate
pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets
demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming
thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different
settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,
allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its
adaptability as more advanced models emerge. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出RA-GAN，通过RACEpSp和feature mixer减少种族偏见的面部年龄合成，从而在亲子同龄验证中显著提升种族准确率和身份保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有面部老化模型存在的种族偏见问题，以及亲子照片往往不是同龄导致的验证困难，通过去偏的年龄变换生成同龄图像来提高亲子验证性能。

Method: 设计了基于GAN的面部年龄变换模型RA-GAN，包含两个新模块RACEpSp（用于种族信息消融与保留平衡）和feature mixer（用于融合结构与纹理特征），并将合成的无偏照片用于亲子验证实验。

Result: RA-GAN在种族准确率上比SAM-GAN平均提高13.14%，在60+年龄组比CUSP-GAN提高9.1%；在身份保持方面优于SAM-GAN和CUSP-GAN。将KinFaceW-I/II数据集中父子/父女/母子/母女图像变换到同龄后，KinFaceW-I的准确率分别提升5.22、5.12、1.63、0.41个百分点，KinFaceW-II在若干关系上也有小幅提升（父女2.9，父子0.39，母子1.6）。

Conclusion: 本文提出的RA-GAN通过引入RACEpSp模块和feature mixer，实现了去除种族偏见的面部年龄合成，从而在亲子验证任务中提升了在同龄人照片匹配的准确率。

Abstract: The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the
photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often
unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the
likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN,
consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially
unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship
verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child
images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an
average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by
9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects'
identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.
Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the
KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the
verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our
RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter,
mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41,
respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships
of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on
KinFaceW-II, respectively. The code is available

*Zaiquan Yang,Yuhao Liu,Gerhard Hancke,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Paper proposes a zero-shot STVG method using MLLMs with DSTH (decoupling queries and LRA to create spatial/temporal prompts) and TAS (assemble predictions with temporal augmentation), leading to SOTA results on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable zero-shot spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by addressing their dynamic token assignment and suboptimal cue integration.

Method: Decouple query into attribute/action sub-queries; use logit-guided re-attention to learn latent spatial/temporal prompts highlighting visual cues; apply temporal-augmented assembling by using original and temporally augmented frames to enforce temporal consistency; evaluate across multiple MLLMs and benchmarks.

Result: A zero-shot MLLM-based framework incorporating decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) with logit-guided re-attention (LRA) to produce spatial and temporal prompts, improving grounding and outperforming SOTA on three STVG benchmarks.

Conclusion: DSTH and TAS effectively leverage MLLMs' reasoning, improving spatial and temporal grounding zero-shot and achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple STVG datasets.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal
tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we
utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot
solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to
dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens},
for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal
grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query
(\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we
propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel
decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented
assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH
strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action
sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and
temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to
learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token
predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action
cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and
temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the
attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS
strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the
temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We
evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods
on three common STVG benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSDD是针对玉米苗期立苗计数的航空影像数据集，覆盖多样场景并为检测模型提供基准：单株检测表现优异，双/三株受稀缺与形态不规则影响仍难以准确识别，YOLO系列在速度与准确性上各有权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人工田间调查耗时易错，需自动化、实时且精确的苗情检测以支持补播、投入调整与产量预测，因而需要高质量、真实场景覆盖广的标注数据集来训练与评估检测模型。

Method: 构建包含单株、双株、三株三类标注的航空影像数据集，覆盖多生长阶段、种植布局、土壤与光照、视角和密度；对多种目标检测模型（如YOLO系列）进行基准测试，比较精度、召回、推理速度与保存时间。

Result: 在基准测试中：V4-V6阶段与天顶（近正射）视角检测最稳健；YOLO11推理最快（约35ms/图像，另加120ms保存）；YOLOv9在单株类别上达最高准确性（Precision最高0.984、Recall最高0.873）；双株与三株检测准确率显著低于单株，受样本不均衡和种植误差影响。

Conclusion: MSDD为玉米出苗点数检测提供了高质量航空图像数据集，提升了早期作物监测与精细农业决策支持的基础条件，但多株类别识别仍受样本稀少和不规则形态影响准确性有限。

Abstract: Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet
curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image
dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season
crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting
determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as
replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and
error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD
contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse
growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,
and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows
detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among
tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for
single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall
up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity
and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further
reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11
maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for
saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that
enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time
decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural
monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

Motivation: 自回归模型直接将自然语言的下一个token预测范式应用到视觉领域时，遇到高层语义学习受阻，导致理解与生成能力不足，需通过新的训练目标引导其学习高质量视觉表示。

Method: 在标准下一个token预测目标上融入若干自监督任务以增强跨步语义一致性、减弱局部条件依赖并引入空间不变性引导；设计训练损失并联合优化，保持原有采样策略。

Result: ST-AR uses self-supervised objectives added to autoregressive next-token training to improve visual semantics and generation quality.

Conclusion: 自监督引导训练能在不依赖预训练表示的情况下，显著提升自回归图像模型的语义理解与生成质量，实验显示大幅降低FID。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual
representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of
generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally
designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges.
In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms
of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We
identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual
semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,
and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively
addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to
a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models
(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR
significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models
and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings
approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for
LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

Motivation: 现有水印方法对裁剪、旋转等几何变换脆弱，需一种能估计并逆转这些变换的同步机制以提升水印在实战中生存能力。

Method: 提出由嵌入器和提取器组成的端到端训练网络，嵌入器对图像进行不可察觉修改，提取器预测图像所受的几何变换参数，训练目标为预测误差与对抗判别器维持的感知质量的加权和。

Result: 在多种几何和数值度量变换上进行了实验，结果显示SyncSeal能准确同步图像，并能使若干之前对几何变换脆弱的水印方法恢复鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SyncSeal能显著提高图像在几何变换下的同步能力与水印鲁棒性，能作为现有水印方法的增量模块有效提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: Synchronization is the task of estimating and inverting geometric
transformations (e.g., crop, rotation) applied to an image. This work
introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image
synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods
to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an
embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that
predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both
networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and
ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to
maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a
wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its
effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our
synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to
withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built
upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We
propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric
Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric
manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame
and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware
Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories,
thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction.
Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a
variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact
latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When
finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the
proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹预测多依赖完整且无噪声的观测数据，忽视了视野外/遮挡目标以及定位传感器噪声（由相机覆盖、遮挡、缺乏去噪真值等引起），这在真实场景中影响安全性与可靠性，因而需要预测视野外目标的无噪声视觉轨迹。

Method: 设计了Vision-Positioning Denoising Module，使用相机标定建立视觉与定位（世界/像素）之间的映射，在无视觉参考的情况下对定位传感器的噪声轨迹进行无监督去噪；同时将去噪模块与轨迹预测模型相结合并对现有预测模型进行任务适配，构建全面基准实验。

Result: 在Vi-Fi和JRDB数据集上，方法在轨迹去噪和预测两个任务上均取得了SOTA性能，显著优于此前基线；同时与卡尔曼滤波等传统去噪方法比较，以及将近期轨迹预测模型适配至此任务后进行对比，构成了全面基准。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous
systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and
virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free
observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight
objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera
coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised
trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable
prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present
advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the
noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.
Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight
Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending
its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual
reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera
calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of
visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an
unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB
datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory
denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.
Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such
as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,
providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative

Abstract: To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based
multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation
and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the
computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then
gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve
great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion
models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In
this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models
in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion
process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we
design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve
efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net
and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling
strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence
estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two
novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive
performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory.
CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and
ETH3D. Code is available at: https://github.com/cvg/diffmvs.

TL;DR: ScaleCUA provides a large multi-OS GUI interaction dataset and trained VLM-based CUAs that significantly improve general-purpose GUI operation, demonstrating the value of scaled, open data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ScaleCUA aims to address the shortage of large-scale, open-source datasets and foundation models for training Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) that can autonomously operate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) across platforms.

Method: They constructed a large-scale dataset across 6 OSs and 3 domains using a closed-loop pipeline that unites automated agents with human experts, then trained VLM-based CUAs on this data and evaluated on multiple benchmarks showing significant gains and new SOTA results.

Result: They built ScaleCUA, a large dataset covering 6 operating systems and 3 task domains via a closed-loop pipeline combining automated agents and human experts, and trained models on it achieving strong improvements over baselines and new state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks (e.g., +26.6 on WebArena-Lite-v2, 94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard).

Conclusion: Data-driven scaling via a large, diverse dataset and closed-loop agent-human pipeline substantially improves general-purpose computer use agents, and releasing data/models will accelerate research.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled computer use agents (CUAs) that
operate GUIs autonomously, showing great potential, yet progress is limited by
the lack of large-scale, open-source computer use data and foundation models.
In this work, we introduce ScaleCUA, a step toward scaling open-source CUAs. It
offers a large-scale dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains,
built via a closed-loop pipeline uniting automated agents with human experts.
Trained on this scaled-up data, ScaleCUA can operate seamlessly across
platforms. Specifically, it delivers strong gains over baselines (+26.6 on
WebArena-Lite-v2, +10.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro) and sets new state-of-the-art
results (94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard, 60.6% on OSWorld-G, 47.4% on
WebArena-Lite-v2). These findings underscore the power of data-driven scaling
for general-purpose computer use agents. We will release data, models, and code
to advance future research: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ScaleCUA.

*Luca Bartolomei,Enrico Mannocci,Fabio Tosi,Matteo Poggi,Stefano Mattoccia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用视觉基础模型对齐RGB生成密集代理深度标签，并适配VFM去从单目事件相机预测深度，解决了事件相机深度数据稀缺问题，性能接近或超越全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在高速和复杂光照场景下具备优势，但缺乏带有密集深度标注的大规模数据集，限制了基于学习的单目深度估计研究。利用大规模预训练的VFM可以弥补标注缺失，通过跨模态蒸馏生成高质量代理标签。

Method: 1) 使用与RGB帧空间对齐的事件流；2) 用视觉基础模型（例如DAv2或定制递归VFM）在RGB或对齐输入上推断深度，生成密集代理标签；3) 将这些代理标签用于训练单目事件相机的深度估计网络（并可微调或适配VFM架构以直接从事件数据预测深度）。

Result: 在合成与真实世界数据集上，跨模态蒸馏方法在无需昂贵密集深度标注的情况下，达到了与全监督方法相当的性能；基于VFM（包括改进的递归架构）的方法取得了当前最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种跨模态蒸馏范式，利用视觉基础模型（VFM）为事件相机生成密集的代理深度标签，通过与RGB帧的空间对齐，避免了昂贵的深度标注需求。作者还提出对VFM进行适配，包括使用现成的DAv2或设计新的递归结构以适配单目事件数据。实验证明该方法在合成与真实数据集上可与全监督方法竞争并取得SOTA表现。

Abstract: Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information,
making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed
motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large
datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based
monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we
propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels
leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event
stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available
off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally,
we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2),
or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from
monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world
datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive
performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive
depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: VocAlign: source-free VLM adaptation using student-teacher, vocabulary alignment, LoRA fine-tuning, and Top-K class selection, yielding notable mIoU gains


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable source-free open-vocabulary segmentation adaptation for VLMs by improving pseudo-labels and efficient fine-tuning without accessing source data

Method: Student-teacher with vocabulary alignment and LoRA+Top-K

Result: +6.11 mIoU on CityScapes and strong zero-shot segmentation improvements

Conclusion: VocAlign provides an efficient, effective source-free domain adaptation approach for open-vocabulary segmentation, improving pseudo-label quality and reducing compute/memory via LoRA and Top-K selection.

Abstract: We introduce VocAlign, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework
specifically designed for VLMs in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Our
method adopts a student-teacher paradigm enhanced with a vocabulary alignment
strategy, which improves pseudo-label generation by incorporating additional
class concepts. To ensure efficiency, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing
computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection
mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory
requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach
achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and
demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting
a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.

### [68] [Calibration-Aware Prompt Learning for Medical Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15226)
*Abhishek Basu,Fahad Shamshad,Ashshak Sharifdeen,Karthik Nandakumar,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalibPrompt improves Med-VLM calibration via prompt tuning using a smoothed accuracy regularizer and an angular separation loss, yielding better-calibrated confidences under limited labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) are powerful but their confidence calibration is underexplored, risking overconfident mistakes that hurt clinical trust.

Method: Optimize a small set of learnable prompts under scarce-labeled regime with two objectives: a smoothed-accuracy alignment regularizer and an angular separation loss to align textual features for reliable confidence estimates.

Result: CalibPrompt, a prompt-tuning framework that calibrates Med-VLMs by optimizing learnable prompts with calibration objectives, improves calibration across multiple models and datasets without harming accuracy.

Conclusion: CalibPrompt consistently improves calibration of Med-VLMs across models and datasets while preserving accuracy, offering a practical calibration method during prompt tuning.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale
image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely
unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated
predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and
decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the
first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt
optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration
objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that
attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences.
Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature
proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of
multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs
and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently
improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is
available at https://github.com/iabh1shekbasu/CalibPrompt.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of digital health technologies has amplified the need
for robust, interoperable solutions to manage complex healthcare data. We
present the Spezi Data Pipeline, an open-source Python toolkit designed to
streamline the analysis of digital health data, from secure access and
retrieval to processing, visualization, and export. The Pipeline is integrated
into the larger Stanford Spezi open-source ecosystem for developing research
and translational digital health software systems. Leveraging HL7 FHIR-based
data representations, the pipeline enables standardized handling of diverse
data types--including sensor-derived observations, ECG recordings, and clinical
questionnaires--across research and clinical environments. We detail the
modular system architecture and demonstrate its application using real-world
data from the PAWS at Stanford University, in which the pipeline facilitated
efficient extraction, transformation, and clinician-driven review of Apple
Watch ECG data, supporting annotation and comparative analysis alongside
traditional monitors. By reducing the need for bespoke development and
enhancing workflow efficiency, the Spezi Data Pipeline advances the scalability
and interoperability of digital health research, ultimately supporting improved

Abstract: To meet the standards of the Open Science movement, the FAIR Principles
emphasize the importance of making scientific data Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable. Yet, creating a repository that adheres to these
principles presents significant challenges. Managing large volumes of diverse
research data and metadata, often generated rapidly, requires a precise
approach. This necessity has led to the development of Software Reference
Architectures (SRAs) to guide the implementation process for FAIR-compliant
repositories. This article conducts a systematic review of research efforts
focused on architectural solutions for such repositories. We detail our
methodology, covering all activities undertaken in the planning and execution
phases of the review. We analyze 323 references from reputable sources and
expert recommendations, identifying 7 studies on general-purpose big data SRAs,
13 pipelines implementing FAIR Principles in specific contexts, and 3
FAIR-compliant big data SRAs. We provide a thorough description of their key
features and assess whether the research questions posed in the planning phase
were adequately addressed. Additionally, we discuss the limitations of the
retrieved studies and identify tendencies and opportunities for further
research.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 提出“在非结构化数据上计算”的三阶段范式（抽取—变换—投影）并给出系统设计方向，倡导构建MXFlow以桥接非结构化信息与结构化分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据系统以结构化数据为主，对海量非结构化信息支持不足，导致无法充分利用其分析潜力。为弥补这一缺口，需设计能在非结构化和结构化间双向转换的数据系统。

Method: 提出三阶段流水线：1）抽取隐含结构——从文本/图像/音频/视频中提取实体、特征、关系等结构化表示；2）在结构上进行变换与处理——利用传统数据库/数据流/机器学习方法进行清洗、聚合、查询和分析；3）投影回非结构化格式——将处理结果映射回易理解的文本、图像或多模态表示。

Result: 通过两个示例场景（文档理解与多模态检索或推理用例）展示该范式的可行性，并列出实现MXFlow所需的研究组件，如高效抽取器、可解释的投影机制、可扩展的执行引擎与一致性语义等。

Conclusion: 提出将非结构化数据纳入类数据库处理范式，通过双向管道（结构抽取→结构化变换→投影回非结构化）使其兼容结构化计算能力，同时保留非结构化表达便于人和AI使用。论文最终倡导构建名为MXFlow的新型数据系统以实现该范式。

Abstract: Unstructured data, such as text, images, audio, and video, comprises the vast
majority of the world's information, yet it remains poorly supported by
traditional data systems that rely on structured formats for computation. We
argue for a new paradigm, which we call computing on unstructured data, built
around three stages: extraction of latent structure, transformation of this
structure through data processing techniques, and projection back into
unstructured formats. This bi-directional pipeline allows unstructured data to
benefit from the analytical power of structured computation, while preserving
the richness and accessibility of unstructured representations for human and AI
consumption. We illustrate this paradigm through two use cases and present the
research components that need to be developed in a new data system called
MXFlow.
