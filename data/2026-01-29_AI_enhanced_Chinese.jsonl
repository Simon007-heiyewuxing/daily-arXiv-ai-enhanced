Unfortunately, traditional approaches such as fair sharing do not provide performance isolation for storage systems, because their resources (e.g., write buffers and read caches) exhibit high preemption delays. These delays lead to unacceptable spikes in client tail latencies, as clients may be forced to wait arbitrarily long to receive their fair share of resources.\n  We introduce Delta Fair Sharing, a family of algorithms for sharing resources with high preemption delays. These algorithms satisfy two key properties: $\u03b4$-fairness, which bounds a client's delay in receiving its fair share of resources to $\u03b4$ time units, and $\u03b4$-Pareto-efficiency, which allocates unused resources to clients with unmet demand. Together, these properties capture resource-acquisition delays end-to-end, bound well-behaved clients' tail-latency spikes to $\u03b4$ time units, and ensure high utilization. We implement such algorithms in FAIRDB, an extension of RocksDB.

Column names and descriptions are valuable for this task. LLMs can leverage such natural-language schema metadata.

ConStruM constructs a lightweight, reusable structure in which, at query time, it assembles a small context pack emphasizing the most discriminative evidence. ConStruM is designed as an add-on: given a shortlist of candidate targets produced by an upstream matcher, it augments the matcher's final LLM prompt with structured, query-specific evidence so that the final selection is better grounded. For this purpose, we develop a context tree for budgeted multi-level context retrieval and a global similarity hypergraph that surfaces groups of highly similar columns (on both the source and target sides), summarized via group-aware differentiation cues computed online or precomputed offline.

Specifically, they achieve high accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs by re-training complex models from scratch or solving NP-hard selection problems in every iteration. In this paper, we propose ALER, a novel, semi-supervised pipeline designed to bridge the gap between semantic accuracy and computational scalability. ALER eliminates the training bottleneck by using a frozen bi-encoder architecture to generate static embeddings once and then iteratively training a lightweight classifier on top. To address the memory bottleneck associated with large-scale candidate pools, we first select a representative sample of the data and then use K-Means to partition this sample into semantically coherent chunks, enabling an efficient AL loop. We further propose a hybrid query strategy that combines \"confused\" and \"confident\" pairs to efficiently refine the decision boundary while correcting high-confidence errors.Extensive evaluation demonstrates ALER's superior efficiency, particularly on the large-scale DBLP dataset: it accelerates the training loop by 1.3x while drastically reducing resolution latency by a factor of 3.8 compared to the fastest baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALER \u901a\u8fc7\u51bb\u7ed3 bi-encoder \u751f\u6210\u9759\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u5206\u5757\u5019\u9009\u6c60\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u727a\u7272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u9ad8 ER \u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u76d1\u7763\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60 ER \u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6bcf\u8f6e\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u6c42\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4f7f AL \u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0a\u53ef\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08bi-encoder\uff09\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u751f\u6210\u9759\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5176\u4e0a\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u6837+K-Means\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u6c60\u5206\u5757\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u56f0\u60d1\u6837\u672c+\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u9519\u8bef\uff09\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u6539\u8fdb\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u5e76\u4fee\u6b63\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u8bef\u5224\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u7ec4\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0cALER \u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u578b DBLP \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u52a0\u901f\u7ea6 1.3 \u500d\uff0c\u89e3\u6790\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea6 3.8 \u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "ALER \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

While AI-driven dietary assessment has made strides in recent years, the ill-posed nature of recovering size (portion) information from monocular images for accurate estimation of ``how much did you eat?'' is a pressing challenge. Some 3D reconstruction methods have achieved impressive geometric reconstruction but fail to recover the crucial real-world scale of the reconstructed object, limiting its usage in precision nutrition. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 3D computer vision and digital health by proposing a method that recovers a true-to-scale 3D reconstructed object from a monocular image. Our approach leverages rich visual features extracted from models trained on large-scale datasets to estimate the scale of the reconstructed object. This learned scale enables us to convert single-view 3D reconstructions into true-to-life, physically meaningful models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two publicly available datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving nearly a 30% reduction in mean absolute volume-estimation error, showcasing its potential to enhance the domain of precision nutrition.

Existing approaches typically utilize vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for dense prediction. However, VLMs, pre-trained on image-text pairs, are biased toward salient, object-centric regions and exhibit two critical limitations when adapted to segmentation: (i) Foreground Bias, which tends to ignore background regions, and (ii) Limited Spatial Localization, resulting in blurred object boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce DiSa, a novel saliency-aware foreground-background disentangled framework. By explicitly incorporating saliency cues in our designed Saliency-aware Disentanglement Module (SDM), DiSa separately models foreground and background ensemble features in a divide-and-conquer manner. Additionally, we propose a Hierarchical Refinement Module (HRM) that leverages pixel-wise spatial contexts and enables channel-wise feature refinement through multi-level updates.

We propose Semi-Supervised Masked Autoencoder (SSMAE), a framework that jointly optimizes masked image reconstruction and classification using both unlabeled and labeled samples with dynamically selected pseudo-labels. SSMAE introduces a validation-driven gating mechanism that activates pseudo-labeling only after the model achieves reliable, high-confidence predictions that are consistent across both weakly and strongly augmented views of the same image, reducing confirmation bias. On CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, SSMAE consistently outperforms supervised ViT and fine-tuned MAE, with the largest gains in low-label regimes (+9.24% over ViT on CIFAR-10 with 10% labels).

A common assumption is that interpretability and performance are in tension: enforcing sparsity during training degrades accuracy, motivating recent post-hoc approaches such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). However, these post-hoc approaches often suffer from degraded downstream performance and loss of CLIP's inherent multimodal capabilities, with most learned features remaining unimodal.\n  We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates sparsity directly into CLIP training, yielding representations that are both interpretable and performant. Compared to SAEs, our Sparse CLIP representations preserve strong downstream task performance, achieve superior interpretability, and retain multimodal capabilities. We show that multimodal sparse features enable straightforward semantic concept alignment and reveal training dynamics of how cross-modal knowledge emerges. Finally, as a proof of concept, we train a vision-language model on sparse CLIP representations that enables interpretable, vision-based steering capabilities.

Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression.

Evaluations on the ViDoRe benchmark demonstrate that SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% while maintaining robust retrieval fidelity, providing a highly scalable solution for Visual RAG.

In this work, we conduct an in-depth attention analysis and reveal that, unlike autoregressive decoders, LLaDA-V aggregates cross-modal information predominantly in middle-to-late layers, leading to delayed semantic alignment.

In this technical report, we present TeleStyle, a lightweight yet effective model for both image and video stylization. Built upon Qwen-Image-Edit, TeleStyle leverages the base model's robust capabilities in content preservation and style customization. To facilitate effective training, we curated a high-quality dataset of distinct specific styles and further synthesized triplets using thousands of diverse, in-the-wild style categories. We introduce a Curriculum Continual Learning framework to train TeleStyle on this hybrid dataset of clean (curated) and noisy (synthetic) triplets. This approach enables the model to generalize to unseen styles without compromising precise content fidelity.

Traditional survey methods rely on diver inspections, which are hazardous and limited in scalability. This work investigates automated classification of biofouling severity on the Level of Fouling (LoF) scale using both custom computer vision models and large multimodal language models (LLMs). Convolutional neural networks, transformer-based segmentation, and zero-shot LLMs were evaluated on an expert-labelled dataset from the New Zealand Ministry for Primary Industries. Computer vision models showed high accuracy at extreme LoF categories but struggled with intermediate levels due to dataset imbalance and image framing. LLMs, guided by structured prompts and retrieval, achieved competitive performance without training and provided interpretable outputs. The results demonstrate complementary strengths across approaches and suggest that hybrid methods integrating segmentation coverage with LLM reasoning offer a promising pathway toward scalable and interpretable biofouling assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "CV\u6a21\u578b\u64c5\u957f\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\uff0cLLM\u5728\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5224\u65ad\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5272+LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u6709\u524d\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u964d\u4f4e\u6f5c\u6c34\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u5371\u9669\u6027\u5e76\u6269\u5927\u5de1\u68c0\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8239\u4f53\u751f\u7269\u6c61\u635f\u5206\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u751f\u6001\u4e0e\u751f\u7269\u5b89\u5168\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLM\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\uff09\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u897f\u5170\u521d\u7ea7\u4ea7\u4e1a\u90e8\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6bd4\u8f83\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u6613\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u5728\u4e0d\u540cLoF\u7b49\u7ea7\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "Computer vision models\uff08CNNs\u4e0eTransformer\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u533a\u5206\u6781\u7aefLoF\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e2d\u95f4\u7b49\u7ea7\u7684\u5224\u522b\u53d7\u5230\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u53d6\u666f\u95ee\u9898\u5f71\u54cd\u3002LLMs\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u5728\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u53ef\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5206\u5272\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u4e0eLLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u7269\u6c61\u635f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u4e00\u8d77\u8f93\u5165LLM\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u4e2d\u95f4LoF\u7b49\u7ea7\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u53d6\u666f\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, they still suffer from the sparse reward problem: the terminal reward of the entire denoising trajectory is applied to all intermediate steps, resulting in a mismatch between the global feedback signals and the exact fine-grained contributions at intermediate denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce \\textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space. Thus, we propose a reward-aware scheme to calibrate the exploration space by adaptively adjusting a timestep-specific stochasticity injection in the SDE sampler, ensuring a suitable exploration space at all timesteps. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DenseGRPO and highlight the critical role of the valid dense rewards in flow matching model alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "DenseGRPO\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u9010\u6b65\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a2\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3GRPO-based\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u65f6\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u4e2d\u95f4\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDenseGRPO\uff1a1) \u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8eODE\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e2d\u95f4\u6e05\u6670\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u76ca\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5956\u52b1\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574SDE\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6821\u51c6\u63a2\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDenseGRPO\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709GRPO-based\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u611f\u77e5\u63a2\u7d22\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u5e76\u914d\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u6821\u51c6\uff0cDenseGRPO\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u53cd\u9988\u9519\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002"}}

To inherit the well-learned knowledge of VLP models for downstream tasks, several approaches aim to adapt them efficiently with limited supervision. However, these methods either suffer from limited performance, excessive learnable parameters, or extended training times, all of which hinder their effectiveness in adapting the CLIP model to downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a simple yet efficient and effective method called \\textit{\\textbf{F}eature \\textbf{P}rojection \\textbf{L}earning(FPL)} to address these problems. Specifically, we develop a projection model that projects class prototype features into the query image feature space and reconstructs the query image feature map.

However, we observe that existing VPT variants often suffer from unstable training dynamics, characterized by gradient oscillations. A layer-wise analysis reveals that shallow-layer prompts tend to stagnate early, while deeper-layer prompts exhibit high-variance oscillations, leading to cross-layer mismatch. These issues slow convergence and degrade final performance. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Evolution ($\\mathtt{PAE}$), which strengthens vision prompt tuning by explicitly modeling prompt dynamics. From a frequency-domain perspective, we initialize prompts in a task-aware direction by uncovering and propagating frequency shortcut patterns that the backbone inherently exploits for recognition. To ensure coherent evolution across layers, we employ a shared Koopman operator that imposes a global linear transformation instead of uncoordinated, layer-specific updates. Finally, inspired by Lyapunov stability theory, we introduce a regularizer that constrains error amplification during evolution. Extensive experiments show that $\\mathtt{PAE}$ accelerates convergence with an average $1.41\\times$ speedup and improves accuracy by 1--3% on 25 datasets across multiple downstream tasks.

Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space. We also introduce a ConvNeXt-based encoder and design a loss function that combines classification and consistency objectives to drive effective adaptation directly from the target domain. The proposed model achieves an average classification accuracy of 90. 72\\%, 84\\%, and 97. 12\\% in Office-31, Office-Home and Office-Caltech datasets, respectively.

Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Shift sharpness perturbations from weights to pruning masks to get compact robust models", "motivation": "Standard SAM doesn't handle discrete pruning changes; need robustness-aware pruning patterns", "method": "analyze abstract", "result": "C-SAM trains with mask perturbations to improve robustness under pruning; experiments show up to 42% certified robustness gains while keeping accuracy", "conclusion": "C-SAM is effective for finding prunable architectures that retain robustness; outperforms baselines"}}

An open question is whether samples from a shifted distribution can effectively support learning when combined with limited target domain data. We investigate this problem in the context of bladder segmentation in CT guided gynecological brachytherapy, a critical task for accurate dose optimization and organ at risk sparing. While CT scans without brachytherapy applicators (no applicator: NA) are widely available, scans with applicators inserted (with applicator: WA) are scarce and exhibit substantial anatomical deformation and imaging artifacts, making automated segmentation particularly difficult.\n  We propose a dual domain learning strategy that integrates NA and WA CT data to improve robustness and generalizability under covariate shift. Using a curated assorted dataset, we show that NA data alone fail to capture the anatomical and artifact related characteristics of WA images. However, introducing a modest proportion of WA data into a predominantly NA training set leads to significant performance improvements. Through systematic experiments across axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using multiple deep learning architectures, we demonstrate that doping only 10 to 30 percent WA data achieves segmentation performance comparable to models trained exclusively on WA data.\n  The proposed approach attains Dice similarity coefficients of up to 0.94 and Intersection over Union scores of up to 0.92, indicating effective domain adaptation and improved clinical reliability.

Consequently, mass prediction from pixels is ill-posed and therefore benefits from physically meaningful representations to constrain the space of plausible solutions. We propose a physically structured framework for single-image mass estimation that addresses this ambiguity by aligning visual cues with the physical factors governing mass. From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision.

However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process.

Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity.

Prior methods improve surface reconstruction by refining Gaussian depth estimates, either via multi-view geometric consistency or through monocular depth priors. However, multi-view constraints become unreliable under large geometric discrepancies, while monocular priors suffer from scale ambiguity and local inconsistency, ultimately leading to inaccurate Gaussian depth supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates the visibility of shared Gaussian primitives across views, enabling more accurate and stable geometric supervision. In addition, we propose a progressive quadtree-calibrated Monocular depth constraint that performs block-wise affine calibration from coarse to fine spatial scales, mitigating the scale ambiguity of depth priors while preserving fine-grained surface details. Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

Most deep palmprint models assume a closed and stationary distribution, leading to overfitting to dataset-specific textures rather than learning domain-invariant representations. Although data augmentation is commonly used to mitigate this issue, it assumes augmented samples can approximate the target deployment distribution, an assumption that often fails under significant domain mismatch. To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights.

These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSpatialGenEval\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0eSpatialT2I\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u6539\u8fdbT2I\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u91cd\u5927\u8bc4\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u9ad8\u9636\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u662f\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790\u5f53\u524dText-to-image\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff08\u5982\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u3001\u906e\u6321\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaSpatialGenEval\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a1,230\u6761\u957f\u4e14\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8986\u76d625\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0e10\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b50\u57df\uff0c\u6bcf\u6761\u63d0\u793a\u9644\u5e2610\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u7b54\uff1b\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u63d0\u793a\u91cd\u5199\u751f\u6210SpatialT2I\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b15,400\u6761\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8bc4\u6d4b\u4e8621\u4e2a\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Stable Diffusion-XL\u3001Uniworld-V1\u3001OmniGen2\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u572821\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9ad8\u9636\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4f9d\u7136\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u4f7f\u7528SpatialT2I\u5fae\u8c03\u4e09\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u5e26\u6765+4.2%\u3001+5.7%\u3001+4.4%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347T2I\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5173\u7cfb\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction.

Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance.

The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong robustness when handling rare characters, multilingual text, and handwritten content. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-Parsing achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both the OmniDocBench and olmOCR-bench benchmarks.

We further introduce a taxonomy based on generators' final components and categorize 21 widely used generators accordingly, enabling a comprehensive investigation of our method's generalization capability. Using only 100 samples from each of three representative categories, our detector-fine-tuned on the DINOv3 backbone-achieves an average accuracy of 98.83% across 22 testing sets from unseen generators.", "AI": {"tldr": "Use generators' final components to perturb real images, train detector on these, achieves 98.83% avg accuracy on unseen generators with few samples", "motivation": "Many modern image generators, despite different paradigms, share common final components that map representations to images; leveraging them helps build generalizable detectors", "method": "contaminate real images with generator final components and train detector", "result": "detector fine-tuned on DINOv3 backbone using 100 samples per category, evaluated on 22 unseen generators, 98.83% average accuracy", "conclusion": "contaminating real images with final components of generators yields detectors that generalize well to unseen generators"}}

In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop.

Detail-Preserving Portrait Collection Generation via Natural Language Edits", "comment": null, "summary": "As social media platforms proliferate, users increasingly demand intuitive ways to create diverse, high-quality portrait collections. In this work, we introduce Portrait Collection Generation (PCG), a novel task that generates coherent portrait collections by editing a reference portrait image through natural language instructions. This task poses two unique challenges to existing methods: (1) complex multi-attribute modifications such as pose, spatial layout, and camera viewpoint; and (2) high-fidelity detail preservation including identity, clothing, and accessories. To address these challenges, we propose CHEESE, the first large-scale PCG dataset containing 24K portrait collections and 573K samples with high-quality modification text annotations, constructed through an Large Vison-Language Model-based pipeline with inversion-based verification.

However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \\textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \\textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

While recent approaches leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to transfer high-level concept knowledge, methods based on purely vision foundation models (VFMs), like DINOv2, have lagged behind in performance. We argue that this gap stems from two practical issues: (i) limited diversity in existing auxiliary anomaly detection datasets and (ii) overly shallow VFM adaptation strategies. To address both challenges, we propose AnomalyVFM, a general and effective framework that turns any pretrained VFM into a strong zero-shot anomaly detector. Our approach combines a robust three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme with a parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism, utilising low-rank feature adapters and a confidence-weighted pixel loss. Together, these components enable modern VFMs to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically, with RADIO as a backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves an average image-level AUROC of 94.1% across 9 diverse datasets, surpassing previous methods by significant 3.3 percentage points.

To address these issues, we propose a novel black-whIte bOx prompT leArning framework (IOTA), which integrates a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module for downstream task adaptation. Specifically, the White Box module derives corrective knowledge by contrasting the wrong predictions with the right cognition.

By jointly leveraging knowledge- and data-driven learning signals, IOTA achieves effective downstream task adaptation.

Conventional vision-language models (VLMs) invariably process visual tokens in a rigid raster-scan order (top-left to bottom-right) with fixed positional encoding when fed into LLMs. However, this contradicts human visual perception, which follows flexible yet semantically coherent scanning patterns driven by inherent logical structures. Particularly for images with complex layouts, human vision exhibits causally-informed sequential processing. Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning.

A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry.

This work reviews various training paradigm and evaluates the robustness of state-of-the-art ReID models in cross-domain applications and examines the role of foundation models in improving generalization through richer, more transferable visual representations. We compare three training paradigms, supervised, self-supervised, and language-aligned models. Through the study the aim is to answer the following questions: Can supervised models generalize in cross-domain scenarios? How does foundation models like SigLIP2 perform for the ReID tasks? What are the weaknesses of current supervised and foundational models for ReID? We have conducted the analysis across 11 models and 9 datasets. Our results show a clear split: supervised models dominate their training domain but crumble on cross-domain data. Language-aligned models, however, show surprising robustness cross-domain for ReID tasks, even though they are not explicitly trained to do so.

In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction.

Existing methods often exploit cross-modal embedding misalignment to detect inconsistency but struggle when visual and textual content are loosely related or semantically indirect. While recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate sarcastic cues, the inherent diversity and subjectivity of these generations often introduce noise. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Discrepancy Comparison Network (GDCNet). This framework captures cross-modal conflicts by utilizing descriptive, factually grounded image captions generated by Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as stable semantic anchors.

These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the inherent challenges of these tasks and the effectiveness of our proposed method.

In spite of the vast amount of research on this problem, morph detection systems struggle in cross-dataset scenarios. To address this problem, we introduce a region-aware frequency-based morph detection strategy that drastically improves over strong baseline methods in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings using a lightweight approach. Having observed the separability of bona fide and morph samples in the frequency domain of different facial parts, our approach 1) introduces the concept of residual frequency domain, where the frequency of the signal is decoupled from the natural spectral decay to easily discriminate between morph and bona fide data; 2) additionally, we reason in a global and local manner by combining the evidence from different facial regions in a Markov Random Field, which infers a globally consistent decision. The proposed method, trained exclusively on the synthetic morphing attack detection development dataset (SMDD), is evaluated in challenging cross-dataset and cross-morph settings on FRLL-Morph and MAD22 sets. Our approach achieves an average equal error rate (EER) of 1.85\\% on FRLL-Morph and ranks second on MAD22 with an average EER of 6.12\\%, while also obtaining a good bona fide presentation classification error rate (BPCER) at a low attack presentation classification error rate (APCER) using only spectral features.

Existing studies typically involve only a limited number of actions, focus on either pairwise assessments (e.g., A is better than B) or on binary labels (e.g., good execution vs needs improvement). In response to these shortcomings, we introduce ProSkill, the first benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural tasks. ProSkill provides absolute skill assessment annotations, along with pairwise ones. This is enabled by a novel and scalable annotation protocol that allows for the creation of an absolute skill assessment ranking starting from pairwise assessments. This protocol leverages a Swiss Tournament scheme for efficient pairwise comparisons, which are then aggregated into consistent, continuous global scores using an ELO-based rating system. We use our dataset to benchmark the main state-of-the-art skill assessment algorithms, including both ranking-based and pairwise paradigms. The suboptimal results achieved by the current state-of-the-art highlight the challenges and thus the value of ProSkill in the context of skill assessment for procedural videos.

While PL has demonstrated strong generalization on natural image datasets, its transferability to remote sensing (RS) imagery remains underexplored. RS data present unique challenges, including multi-label scenes, high intra-class variability, and diverse spatial resolutions, that hinder the direct applicability of existing PL methods. In particular, current prompt-based approaches often struggle to identify dominant semantic cues and fail to generalize to novel classes in RS scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose BiMoRS, a lightweight bi-modal prompt learning framework tailored for RS tasks. BiMoRS employs a frozen image captioning model (e.g., BLIP-2) to extract textual semantic summaries from RS images. These captions are tokenized using a BERT tokenizer and fused with high-level visual features from the CLIP encoder. A lightweight cross-attention module then conditions a learnable query prompt on the fused textual-visual representation, yielding contextualized prompts without altering the CLIP backbone. We evaluate BiMoRS on four RS datasets across three domain generalization (DG) tasks and observe consistent performance gains, outperforming strong baselines by up to 2% on average.

However, adapting such large-scale models is computationally expensive and still relies on substantial Mean Opinion Score (MOS) annotations. We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability. Guided by these signals, the student learns the teacher's quality perception patterns through joint distillation and is calibrated on a small MOS subset to align with human annotations.

LEMON comprises 2,277 video segments spanning 5 disciplines and 29 courses, with an average duration of 196.1 seconds, yielding 4,181 high-quality QA pairs, including 3,413 multiple-choice and 768 open-ended questions. Distinct from existing video benchmarks, LEMON features: (1) semantic richness and disciplinary density, (2) tightly coupled video-audio-text modalities, (3) explicit temporal and pedagogical structure, and (4) contextually linked multi-turn questioning. It further encompasses six major tasks and twelve subtasks, covering the full cognitive spectrum from perception to reasoning and then to generation. Comprehensive experiments reveal substantial performance gaps across tasks, highlighting that even state-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o struggle with temporal reasoning and instructional prediction.

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms).

For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9token\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411token\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u5373\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u89c6\u89c9token\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5174\u8d77\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u754c\u7684\u6210\u719f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u5c06\u4e8c\u8005\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u7528\u8868\u793a\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u56de\u987e\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89c6\u89c9token\u4e24\u5927\u6280\u672f\u65cf\u7fa4\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u4e0e\u4ee3\u8868\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u5c06\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411token\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u3001AIGC\u4e0e\u5177\u8eabAI\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u4e0e\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u7edf\u4e00\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9token\u8d70\u5411\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4ee5\u670d\u52a1\u5e7f\u6cdb\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9token\u6280\u672f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u540c\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e8c\u8005\u5728\u8ffd\u6c42\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0a\u7684\u5171\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684token\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We present FairT2V, a training-free debiasing framework for text-to-video generation that mitigates encoder-induced bias without finetuning. We first analyze demographic bias in T2V models and show that it primarily originates from pretrained text encoders, which encode implicit gender associations even for neutral prompts. We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.\n  Based on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule. We further propose a video-level fairness evaluation protocol combining VideoLLM-based reasoning with human verification.

Black", "Yan Zhang"], "title": "Open-Vocabulary Functional 3D Human-Scene Interaction Generation", "comment": "18 pages", "summary": "Generating 3D humans that functionally interact with 3D scenes remains an open problem with applications in embodied AI, robotics, and interactive content creation. The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as \"sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., \"increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFunHSI\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u3001\u4ee5\u529f\u80fd\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u63a5\u89e6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u5bf9\u8c61\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u6216\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0a\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u529f\u80fd\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u529f\u80fd\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u4ee5\u63a5\u89e6\u63a8\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "method": "FunHSI\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u529f\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u573a\u666f\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u5176\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u63cf\u8ff0\u9ad8\u5c42\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u56fe\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4eba\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u521d\u6b65\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8eab\u4f53\u4e0e\u624b\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u7cbe\u5316\u6240\u63d0\u8bae\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u59ff\u6001\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u4e0e\u5ba4\u5916\u591a\u6837\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cFunHSI\u5728\u751f\u6210\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u9762\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u822c\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u5982\"\u5750\u5728\u6c99\u53d1\u4e0a\"\uff09\uff0c\u4e5f\u652f\u6301\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u5982\"\u589e\u5927\u5ba4\u5185\u6e29\u5ea6\"\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "FunHSI\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u987b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u4ee5\u529f\u80fd\u4e3a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u4eba-\u573a\u666f\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u529f\u80fd\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63a5\u89e6\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u573a\u666f\u5143\u7d20\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u56fe\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5c5e\u4e8e\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4eba\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9636\u6bb5\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u529f\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7528\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002"}}

However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56fe\u50cf+IMU\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b+\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u8def\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u591a\u5b50\u96c6ROAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u573a\u666f\u548c\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RSC\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73af\u5883\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6848\u4e0e\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u878d\u5408RGB\u4e0eIMU\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u540e\u63a5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5c42\u6839\u636e\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u8c03\u6574\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u6743\u91cd\uff1b\u6784\u5efaROAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e09\u5b50\u96c6\u4ee5\u8986\u76d6\u5b9e\u666f\u3001\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u4e0e\u5408\u6210OOD\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728PVS\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347+1.4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728ROAD\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347+11.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff1b\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7c7bF1\u5206\u6570\u548c\u591c\u95f4\u3001\u66b4\u96e8\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u8def\u9762\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5ec9\u4ef7\u76f8\u673a+IMU\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0eIMU\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9053\u8def\u8def\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5c42\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86ROAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u5408\u6210\u5b50\u96c6\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728PVS\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u548cROAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u548c\u6076\u52a3\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement. Experiments across multiple datasets show that FreeFix improves multi-frame consistency and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning-based methods, while retaining strong generalization ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "FreeFix\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u76842D-3D\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u7cbe\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u50cf\u7d20\u7f6e\u4fe1\u63a9\u7801\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5916\u63a8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0a\u4ee5\u9ad8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u6539\u5584\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4f46\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u514d\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u597d\u4f46\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u5fae\u8c03\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5916\u63a8\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u9519\u76842D-3D\u7cbe\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u76842D\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u4fee\u590d\u4fe1\u606f\u53cd\u9988\u81f33D\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5982NeRF\u62163D Gaussian Splatting\uff09\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u5e27\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7f6e\u4fe1\u63a9\u7801\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9700\u91cd\u70b9\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFreeFix\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5916\u63a8\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5b9a\u91cf\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u53ef\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u6301\u5e73\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "FreeFix\u5728\u4e0d\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5916\u63a8\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
