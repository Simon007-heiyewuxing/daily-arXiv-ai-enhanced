*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对比基线模型，加入拓扑正则化的神经学启发模型在三种VLM和三数据集上对MIA的鲁棒性更强，攻击AUC平均下降约24%，模型生成文本质量基本不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在多模态代理AI时代，生物学启发的表示是否能提升VLMs对隐私攻击（尤其图文成员推断攻击）的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出基于神经科学启发的拓扑正则化（tau），在训练阶段加入拓扑约束以改变表示空间，从而减少对训练样本的记忆，评估通过黑盒成员推断攻击并用ROC-AUC和文本质量（MPNet、ROUGE-2）衡量。

Result: Neuro-inspired topological regularization (tau) reduces membership inference attack (MIA) success on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs).

Conclusion: 在不显著降低模型实用性的前提下，tau>0的神经启发VLMs对图文成员推断攻击具有较高的抵抗力，且在不同模型和数据集上一致。

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

### [2] [Inferix: A Block-Diffusion based Next-Generation Inference Engine for World Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20714)
*Inferix Team,Tianyu Feng,Yizeng Han,Jiahao He,Yuanyu He,Xi Lin,Teng Liu,Hanfeng Lu,Jiasheng Tang,Wei Wang,Zhiyuan Wang,Jichao Wu,Mingyang Yang,Yinghao Yu,Zeyu Zhang,Bohan Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix is an inference engine specialized for semi-autoregressive world-model video generation, combining diffusion+autoregressive strengths, KV cache, streaming, and LV-Bench for long minute-scale videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models can generate long, realistic, interactive videos; scaling could enable emergent capabilities beyond LLM-centric vision models; semi-autoregressive block-diffusion decoding is key.

Method: Inferix: inference engine optimized for semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding, reintroduces KV cache management, supports interactive video streaming, profiling, LV-Bench integration.

Result: Enables efficient, variable-length, high-quality, coherent, stable long video generation, real-time interaction and benchmarking for minute-long videos.

Conclusion: Inferix advances world simulation inference, distinct from high-concurrency systems and classic video diffusion, facilitating immersive long-video synthesis and community-driven development.

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

### [3] [Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20716)
*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对资源受限摄像头提出LTED-Ada：单设备用深度强化学习自适应在本地跟踪与边缘检测间切换，多设备用联邦学习协同训练；硬件实测表明方法在延迟与准确性上优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限设备（如交通摄像头）无法在本地运行高精度目标检测，纯边缘卸载或纯本地跟踪各有不足，需设计在准确率与延迟间权衡的自适应决策机制。

Method: 将帧间时间相关性与移动边缘网络动态特性建模为长期优化问题；单设备场景采用深度强化学习（LTED-Ada）根据帧率、准确性与延迟需求自适应选择边缘检测或本地跟踪；多设备场景通过联邦学习协作训练策略以提升泛化能力。

Result: 在Raspberry Pi 4B 多设备与PC边缘服务器的硬件实测中，LTED-Ada优于对比方法，在多种帧率与性能需求下表现出更好的延迟-准确率权衡与更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的混合边缘检测与本地跟踪自适应选择策略（LTED-Ada）有效平衡了识别准确性与延迟，并能在单设备与多设备场景中提升整体性能。

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

### [4] [DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720)
*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD 是一种无需训练的动作引导早退框架，通过评估中间轨迹与轻量规划先验的对齐来提前终止深层 VLA 推理，并辅以多跳控制器提升效率，在 Bench2Drive 上实现约 28% 层稀疏与 29% 延迟减少，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 VLA 模型虽能统一感知、推理与轨迹生成，但深层 transformer 引起显著推理延迟；因此需要一种无需重训即可在保证安全与规划质量前提下加速推理的方法。

Method: 引入基于轨迹与轻量级规划先验（如 Navigation 或 低精度规划）对齐的早退判定，而非置信度；设计多跳控制器根据得分变化率自适应跳过冗余 transformer 层；可无缝集成到现有 VLA 模型（如 ORION）无需重训。

Result: 在 Bench2Drive 基准上，DeeAD 达到最多 28% 的 transformer 层稀疏性和 29% 的延迟降低，同时保持规划质量与安全性。

Conclusion: DeeAD 提供了一种训练无关、动作引导的早退机制，通过物理可行性检验中间轨迹来减少 VLA 模型的推理延迟，同时保持规划质量与安全性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [5] [Foundry: Distilling 3D Foundation Models for the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20721)
*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FMD与其3D点云实现Foundry，通过学习压缩的SuperTokens重建教师token表示，实现高效且保通用性的基础模型压缩，适合边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型虽强大但体积大、计算开销高，不利于在机器人和AR/VR等资源受限设备上部署。传统压缩（如标准知识蒸馏）会牺牲模型的下游通用性，因而需要一种既高效又保持通用性的压缩方法。

Method: 提出Foundry实现FMD在3D点云上的应用。核心思路是训练学生模型学习一组压缩的“SuperTokens”，通过重建教师模型的token级表示来捕获教师潜在空间的紧凑基。学生模型因此以更少的token和FLOPs近似教师的表示。

Result: 单一蒸馏模型在分类、部分分割和少样本等多种下游任务上保持了强的迁移能力，性能接近完整基础模型，同时显著减少token数量和计算开销，使其更适合资源受限硬件。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种新的蒸馏范式（Foundation Model Distillation, FMD），用于将大型自监督预训练的基础模型压缩为在边缘设备上可部署的紧凑代理，同时保持其通用表示能力。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

### [6] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用预训练的DINOv2特征并在ViT的patch嵌入上加一个线性分类头，通过滑窗聚合和后处理生成精细篡改热图，平均IoU比次优模型高12%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高生成性修补（inpainting）中语义篡改区域的定位能力，区分语义与非语义编辑并提供鲁棒检测。

Method: 在B-Free数据集上预训练的DINOv2上，加线性分类头以14×14补丁分辨率预测篡改；采用滑窗解决固定输入限制；后处理热图生成二值掩码。

Result: DinoLizer是一个基于DINOv2的生成性修补（inpainting）篡改局部化模型。

Conclusion: DinoLizer利用ViT的强表征，在多种修补数据集上显著优于现有局部篡改检测方法，对常见后处理操作具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [7] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CANVAS benchmarks VLMs performing stepwise tool-based UI edits; shows models can improve designs via strategic invocations but still make common errors needing future work


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate VLMs' ability to interact with design software for iterative UI editing, filling lack of benchmarks

Method: Analyze paper benchmark CANVAS for VLM tool-based UI design

Result: Created CANVAS benchmark: 598 tasks from 3.3K mobile UIs across 30 categories; two task types (replication, modification); findings show leading models use strategic tool invocations and improve design quality; common error patterns identified

Conclusion: CANVAS enables measuring and diagnosing VLM tool-based UI design capabilities, revealing strengths (strategic tool use) and weaknesses (error patterns) to guide improvements

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

### [8] [Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20770)
*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE)，使图像编码器根据文本查询生成条件化图像表示，从而提升VLM在多项图像—文本任务上的性能和推理效率，且更具可解释性与任务相关关注能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统先独立预训练再对齐的图像编码器忽视下游任务或文本查询，导致编码信息冗余且与查询不相关；为提高任务适应性和效率，需要让编码器在编码阶段就引入文本指引。

Method: 在图像编码器中引入基于文本查询的条件化机制，使编码过程依赖输入文本；训练时以多样文本查询指导编码器学习提取与查询相关的视觉特征，并在VLM架构中替换标准图像编码器以进行联合微调。

Result: 在九项image-to-text基准上，1B和3B模型规模分别平均提升+1.5和+1.3分，某些任务（DocVQA、InfoVQA）提升可达6分，同时使用一半图像tile实现更优性能，且定性分析显示更好地关注查询相关区域。

Conclusion: TIE使VLM在多项基准上稳定提升性能（平均+1.5和+1.3分），在某些任务达到最高6分提升，同时用更少图像tokens实现更高推理效率，并增强模型对查询相关区域的关注与可解释性。

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMARC利用部分卷积U-Net从仅10%连续补丁输入同时完成表面RGB重建和材料分类，在稀疏观测下显著优于多种基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在受限或部分视角环境下，从稀疏视觉线索中理解材料表面对机器人、仿真和材料感知等应用至关重要，但现有方法多依赖于稠密或全景观测，效果受限。

Method: 构建Partial Convolutional U-Net，输入为单一10%连续图像补丁，网络同时输出重建的RGB表面图和材料分类结果；训练与Touch and Go真实表面纹理数据集，并与卷积自编码器、ViT、MAE、Swin Transformer和DETR等5种模型对比评估PSNR与分类准确率。

Result: 提出SMARC模型：从仅一个连续10%图像补丁输入，完成完整RGB表面重建并进行材料分类。采用Partial Convolutional U-Net并带分类头，实现极端缺失数据下的空间修复与语义理解。在Touch and Go数据集上对比五种基线，取得PSNR 17.55 dB和材料分类准确率85.10%，表现优越。

Conclusion: 部分卷积在缺失数据下具有显著的空间推理优势，SMARC为最小视觉条件下的表面理解奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

*Zuhao Yang,Sudong Wang,Kaichen Zhang,Keming Wu,Sicong Leng,Yifan Zhang,Chengwei Qin,Shijian Lu,Xingxuan Li,Lidong Bing*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongVT通过LMM驱动的全局-局部视频裁剪与代理式工具链思维，结合VideoSIAH大规模训练与三阶段训练策略，有效降低长视频推理中的幻觉并提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频中证据稀疏且时序分散，LMM在链式思维下仍易产生幻觉。受人类先全局扫视再局部详细查看的启发，设计能基于时间定位逐步聚焦的机制以提高答案的视觉证据支撑。

Method: 提出一个端到端的agent框架：利用LMM的时间定位能力作为原生视频裁剪工具（zoom-in）并重采样细粒度帧，执行全局先览后局部详查的循环推理；设计三阶段训练策略（大规模工具集成冷启动监督微调、少量agentic强化学习、agentic强化微调）并构建并发布VideoSIAH数据集用于训练与评估。

Result: 在四个长视频理解与推理基准上，LongVT优于强基线方法；作者提供了247.9K冷启动训练样本、1.6K强化学习样本、15.4K强化微调样本及1,280条人工验证的评估QA，且公开了代码与模型权重。

Conclusion: LongVT通过引入交替的多模态工具链思维（Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought），结合全局-局部的视频裁剪与细粒度帧重采样，实现了在长视频上更精确的推理与证据定位，从而显著降低了LMMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

*Souradeep Dutta,Keshav Bulia,Neena S Nair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 复现并轻量化KRISP，性能约75%，揭示设计缺陷，适合资源受限与边缘设备，能抑制幻觉并仅在限定知识域内生成答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原KRISP在工业级训练下表现良好但计算资源需求高且与大型骨干网紧耦合，研究者希望探索在低资源场景下的替代方案并发现原始工作中未充分讨论的问题。

Method: 通过简化模型结构、限制外部知识图谱域、在合成VQA数据及DAQUAR数据集上进行系统消融实验，评估知识增强的VQA架构在资源受限情况下的可扩展性和有效性。

Result: 轻量化复现模型达到了原始模型约75%的性能，但显著降低参数量和计算需求；在限定知识域下能有效抑制AI幻觉并在离线/边缘设备上实现视觉推理。

Conclusion: 本工作展示了在有限资源下复现KRISP的可行性，得到一个参数更少、能在移动设备上运行的轻量化模型，并揭示了原模型在设计和实验上的若干隐含问题和局限。

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

### [12] [Intriguing Properties of Dynamic Sampling Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20800)
*Dario Morle,Reid Zaffino*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出并分析了一种称为“warping”的动态采样算子，统一并推广了多个现有动态采样方法（如deformable convolutions、active convolutional units、spatial transformer networks）。通过将输入建模为IID变量和齐次随机场，作者对该算子进行了统计分析，发现前向与反向传播存在不对称性，证明了这些机制构成与传统平移不变卷积不同的正交算子类，并给出稳定训练动态采样网络的条件及离散化影响分析。最后提出一种基于梯度更新的新型损失景观可视化方法以理解学习行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习中的动态采样结构广泛且实用，但缺乏统一的理论分析。作者希望通过一个可分析的最小算子来统一这些方法、理解其统计特性和训练稳定性，并探索前后向传播差异及离散化影响。

Method: 提出一个名为warping的泛化算子作为动态采样的最小实现，形式化推导其统计性质；将输入分别视为IID和齐次随机场进行理论分析；分析离散化效应与前/反向传播不对称性；通过实验重建并比较现有方法，并设计基于梯度更新的损失景观可视化工具。

Result: 证明warping能重建多种动态采样模块，分析出不同输入统计模型下的行为，发现前向/反向传播不对称性，给出训练稳定性的充要条件，并通过实验证实理论预测，同时提供新的损失景观可视化以解析学习过程。

Conclusion: Warpping作为一个统一且可分析的动态采样算子，既能重建多种已有结构也揭示了训练中的不对称性和稳定性条件：在适当的统计建模与离散化控制下，动态采样网络可稳定训练并表现为与传统卷积不同的算子类。

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出Δ-NeRF，一种用于增量细化NeRF的模块化残差框架，通过冻结基础NeRF并注入按层残差控制器、引入不确定性感知门控以及视角选择策略，实现无需历史数据的增量更新并可通过知识蒸馏压缩模型。实验（卫星影像）显示在训练时间减少30–42%情况下，性能接近联合训练且优于基线，PSNR较盲目微调提升最多43.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF需在新数据到来时从头联合训练或会导致灾难性遗忘；在如卫星地形随时间重复观测的场景，需高效的增量更新方法以节省时间和历史数据存储。

Method: 方法核心为在冻结的基NeRF前后添加模块化残差控制器，按层注入修正；采用不确定性感知门控模块在每个位置自适应地融合基网络预测和残差修正以防过度修正；设计视角选择策略降低训练视图数量（最多节省47%）并维持性能；最后用知识蒸馏将增强后的网络压缩为仅20%规模的学生网络。

Result: 在卫星影像数据集上，Δ-NeRF在训练时间上节省30–42%，在PSNR等指标上超越盲目微调最多43.5%，在部分指标上甚至优于完整联合训练；知识蒸馏后模型体积降至20%且维持大部分性能。

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF能在没有历史数据的情况下对已训练NeRF进行增量细化，避免灾难性遗忘并减少训练时间与数据需求；结合不确定性门控和知识蒸馏，还能获得紧凑模型且在若干指标上优于联合训练和现有基线。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

Motivation: 解决生成视频合成中的控制性差和数据匮乏问题，通过无标签视频分割前景/背景并自我合成以学习动态主体与场景交互。

Method: 将未标注视频分为动态前景与静态/动态背景层；对前景应用变换增强并采用多层融合模块进行合成训练；引入身份保持损失以保证前景细节；通过自监督自合成构建训练数据，训练生成模型以学习合成关系。

Result: 提出Split-then-Merge (StM)框架；引入变换感知训练、多层融合与增强以实现可用性感知的合成；提出身份保持损失；在量化基准和人工/VLLM评估上优于SoTA。

Conclusion: StM通过无监督分割与自我合成学习复杂的合成动态，结合训练策略和损失设计，实现更好的人物保持与场景贴合，缓解数据依赖并在多项评估中领先。

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

*Samuele Dell'Erba,Andrew D. Bagdanov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出用无训练、无数据的优化替代扩散模型中的文本到视觉先验：Optimization-based Visual Inversion(OVI)。通过从随机伪token初始化潜在视觉向量并迭代优化以最大化与文本嵌入的余弦相似度，同时引入马氏距离和最近邻损失作为正则以约束到真实图像分布。实验在Kandinsky 2.2上表明OVI可替代传统先验，且最近邻约束效果最好；同时指出现有基准（如T2I-CompBench++）存在问题，简单用文本嵌入作为先验仍能得高分但感知质量差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成依赖训练昂贵的扩散先验网络，训练成本高且需大规模数据。作者质疑是否必须训练先验，探索无需训练和数据的替代方案以降低成本并适应数据受限场景。

Method: 提出Optimization-based Visual Inversion(OVI)：从随机伪token初始化潜在视觉编码，目标是最大化与输入文本嵌入的余弦相似度；在优化中加入两种正则项：基于马氏距离的分布约束和最近邻损失以鼓励生成接近真实图像分布的潜在表示。

Result: 在Kandinsky 2.2上实验显示：1) 训练免费OVI能作为传统先验的替代方案；2) 在T2I-CompBench++基准下发现漏洞：直接用文本嵌入作为先验得分高但感知质量差；3) 引入的正则尤其是最近邻损失能提升视觉保真度，定量上可超越或接近最先进的数据高效先验。

Conclusion: 无训练的OVI结合合适正则（尤其是最近邻损失）可以在无需大量数据和训练的情况下替代或接近数据高效先验的性能，但现有评测基准对视觉质量的衡量存在缺陷，应警惕基准误导。

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: RefTr: a recurrently refined Transformer decoder generates confluent trajectories forming accurate centerline graphs, improving recall and efficiency for 3D vascular tree extraction


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintain high recall and correct tree topology for critical clinical tasks by generating complete centerline graphs while reducing parameters and improving efficiency

Method: Recurrence-based Transformer for tubular tree centerline extraction

Result: Producer-Refiner Transformer decoder with confluent trajectory representation, recurrent refinement, and spatial tree NMS; achieves superior recall and comparable precision, faster inference, 2.4x fewer decoder parameters

Conclusion: RefTr sets new SOTA by combining confluent trajectory representation, recurrent refinement, and spatial tree NMS to deliver high-recall, parameter-efficient, and fast centerline extraction

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

TL;DR: V^2-SAM converts SAM2 to cross-view correspondence via geometry-based anchor prompts and visual prompts with a cyclic-consistency expert selector, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Establish consistent associations of same objects across drastically different viewpoints (ego and exo) where segmentation models like SAM2 fail due to viewpoint/appearance variance.

Method: Two prompt generators: V^2-Anchor (DINOv3 features for coordinate-based prompts) and V^2-Visual (visual prompt matcher aligning ego-exo representations), multi-expert fusion, and Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) to pick reliable predictions.

Result: V^2-SAM adapts SAM2 for cross-view correspondence using two prompt generators (V^2-Anchor using DINOv3 for geometry-aware coordinate prompts; V^2-Visual for appearance alignment) plus multi-expert design and PCCS selector; achieves SOTA on Ego-Exo4D, DAVIS-2017, HANDAL-X.

Conclusion: V^2-SAM effectively enables SAM2 for cross-view correspondence by combining coordinate and visual prompts and adaptive expert selection, significantly improving performance on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

### [22] [Test-Time Alignment of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models via Null-Text Embedding Optimisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20889)
*Taehoon Kim,Henry Gouk,Timothy Hospedales*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在 classifier-free guidance 的无条件文本嵌入上进行语义空间优化，可在不改模型参数下实现稳健且泛化良好的测试时对齐，避免 reward hacking。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐方法常在优化程度上出问题：要么欠优化无法显著提升目标奖励，要么过度优化导致 reward hack（利用非语义噪声或潜在空间中的漏洞以虚假提升奖励）。因此需要一种既能有效提升目标奖励又能防止 reward hacking、并能泛化到其他奖励的 TTA 方法。

Method: 在 classifier-free guidance 框架下，将可优化变量设为无条件文本嵌入（unconditional embedding），通过针对目标奖励的推理阶段优化该嵌入，而不是调整潜在变量或噪声。该嵌入作为生成分布的锚点，改变它即可改变生成分布；优化过程中约束在语义空间以避免利用噪声模式进行 reward hacking。无需更新模型参数即可实现对齐。

Result: Null-TTA 在多个任务/奖励下展现出最先进的目标对齐效果，并在不同奖励之间保持强鲁棒的跨奖励泛化。相比于直接优化噪声或潜在变量的方法，Null-TTA 更能保持语义一致性并避免非语义的 exploit。

Conclusion: Null-TTA 是一种通过优化 classifier-free guidance 中的无条件文本嵌入来在推理时对扩散模型进行对齐的方法。它在语义一致的嵌入流形上进行优化，从而防止了典型的 reward hacking，并能在不更新模型参数的情况下直接引导生成分布以提高目标奖励。实验表明该方法在目标测试时对齐上达到了最先进水平，同时保持了良好的跨奖励泛化能力。

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

TL;DR: GaINeR augments INR with trainable Gaussian primitives to add geometric structure and editability; uses K-nearest Gaussian embeddings aggregated by distance feeding an MLP to predict RGB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs lack explicit geometric structure and have limited local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting use in dynamic/interactive settings.

Method: Trainable Gaussian distributions placed over image plane; for each coordinate, find K nearest Gaussians, compute distance-weighted embeddings, aggregate and input to neural network (INR) to predict RGB. Jointly learn Gaussians and network parameters.

Result: Proposes GaINeR: combines trainable Gaussians with INR. Retrieves K nearest Gaussians per coordinate, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, predicts RGB via network. Enables continuous representation, interpretable geometry, flexible local editing. Code public.

Conclusion: GaINeR provides geometry-aware continuous image representations allowing interpretable structure and local edits, bridging INRs and physical/interactive applications.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

Motivation: 减少对比剂用量以降低潜在风险，同时维持对小脑桥角角区病变（如前庭神经鞘瘤）的检测与定性诊断能力。

Method: 将标准T1与标准T1ce用于模拟不同低剂量T1ce，训练深度学习网络以从低剂量输入恢复标准剂量T1ce；通过SSIM、PSNR及分割Dice、Hausdorff距离和平均表面距离评估恢复效果；由头颈放射科医师进行主观评分。

Result: DL模型能将低剂量对比增强T1加权MRI恢复为接近标准剂量图像，提升结构相似性、PSNR和分割性能，在10%-30%剂量下仍可实现病灶检测与诊断描述。

Conclusion: DL恢复使得在10%至30%对比剂剂量下，CPA盂/小脑桥角区的T1ce图像达到临床可用质量，30%剂量效果更佳。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce GRW smoothness penalty on intermediate embeddings to reduce abrupt changes, boosting lightweight video model performance


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight video models struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics; enforce temporal coherence to improve accuracy

Method: GRW-based temporal smoothing

Result: Improves accuracy of lightweight models by 3.8%–6.4% on Kinetics-600; sets new SOTA for MoViNets within FLOP budgets

Conclusion: GRW smoothing enforces low-acceleration embeddings, improving temporal modeling and leading to notable accuracy gains for lightweight architectures

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Motivation: 现有年轮检测依赖人工沿有限径向测量，耗时且精度有限；公开数据缺乏多高度、可用于体积建模的横截面样本，阻碍自动化和体积生长估计方法的发展。作者为解决数据稀缺、提高检测与体积估算能力而构建数据集并评估方法。

Method: 收集102个Pinus taeda木材横截面样本，手工标注每年的年轮边界，并确保样本来自树干不同高度以支持体积建模；基于现有年轮检测算法（包括DeepCS-TRD）进行训练与评估，报告mAP、mAR、ARE等指标，并做消融实验验证参数设置；还评估将该数据加入训练集对模型泛化的影响。

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

Conclusion: 在无需成对图像-报告数据的情况下，使用描述符感知的多任务训练和token级+表示对齐的双重损失，BUSTR提升了报告生成的语言质量和临床相关性，尤其在BI-RADS和病理预测上有明显改进。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

TL;DR: 提出“表达式合成”（expressive composition）任务，关注创意平台上非写实、具有风格性和社交目的的图像编辑行为。构建了基于180万真实编辑行为的数据集，并提出两阶段模型StickerNet：先预测合成类型，再预测不透明度、遮罩、位置和尺度等放置参数。实验和用户研究表明模型优于常规模型并接近人类放置行为，强调从真实编辑行为学习的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像合成强调写实与语义合理性，但现实创作者常追求艺术性、趣味性和社交互动；因此需要新的任务定义与数据来反映真实编辑意图与风格多样性。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 判别/预测合成类型（表达式类型）；2) 基于类型预测放置参数（不透明度、遮罩、位置、尺度）。训练数据来自180万在线平台的真实编辑动作记录而非人工模拟。

Result: 在定量评估和用户研究中，StickerNet表现优于常见基线，生成的放置更接近人类编辑行为，验证了从真实编辑数据中学习的有效性與鲁棒性。

Conclusion: StickerNet能有效学习并复制真实创意平台上的贴纸式合成行为，优于常见基线，并证明从真实用户编辑数据训练能更好地捕捉表达性而非写实性的放置偏好。

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TrafficLens：一种利用摄像头覆盖顺序、可变token VLM迭代和对象相似度跳过策略的多摄像头交通视频快速视频到文本转换方法，达到约4倍加速并保持信息准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统将视频转换为文本再用LLM分析的方法在多摄像头场景下开销巨大，导致时延高，不利于及时决策与事件调查；因此需要一种更快速、保真地将多摄像头视频转为可被LLM高效利用的文本描述的方法。

Method: TrafficLens使用基于覆盖区域的序列处理策略，按重叠覆盖顺序迭代调用VLMs，利用前一摄像头的文本输出作为下一摄像头的提示，并通过不同token限制的VLM迭代减少计算量，同时引入基于对象级相似度的检测器以跳过冗余VLM调用。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，TrafficLens可将视频到文本转换时间缩短最多4倍，同时在信息保持方面表现良好。

Conclusion: TrafficLens有效提升多摄像头交通路口视频转文本的效率，在保持信息准确性的同时显著降低处理时间。

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

Motivation: 保护跨医疗机构协作学习中的病患隐私，同时利用多源数据提升病理图像分类性能。

Method: 提取ViT的768维CLS token，用CKKS对token加密后传输并在服务器端进行同态聚合，避免传输梯度；在三客户端设置上评估攻击与性能。

Result: 提出将ViT的CLS token与CKKS同态加密相结合的联邦学习框架，在三客户端肺癌病理分类任务中，实现通信开销显著减少并抵抗模型反演攻击。

Conclusion: CLS-token加密能在显著降低通信成本的同时保护隐私，并支持密文推理，但加密域性能略有下降。

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

Result: 提出了基于双修正流（dual rectified flows）的inversion-free风格迁移框架。并行预测内容与风格轨迹，通过动态中点插值融合速度场、联合建模三类分布并注入注意力，提升视觉质量与效率。

Conclusion: 双修正流方法在不依赖逆向的前提下实现了高质量风格迁移，兼顾保内容与风格表现，且具有更好的计算效率和鲁棒性，对多种风格与内容均有良好泛化。

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Conclusion: 提出的方法实现了在不依赖测试时参考图像的情况下进行Ref-COD，简化部署并保持竞争性性能。

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: GuardTrace-VL能有效检测多模态模型在中间推理过程中的不安全内容，通过专门的数据集与渐进训练提高鲁棒性，显著优于现有防御方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 方法有效将in/outpainting扩展至图层分解，显著提升对象去除和遮挡恢复质量，为后续编辑提供灵活层级表示。

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Method: 构建实体中心的多模态知识库（EMKB），将文本、图像及结构化知识联合存储；采用多阶段假设-说明策略（先生成候选假设再生成最终说明以增强跨模态对齐）；以及基于图像内容的动态检索以改进视觉-实体匹配。检索到的背景知识被用于增强生成模型。

Result: 在GoodNews和NYTimes800k上，MERGE在CIDEr上分别提升+6.84和+1.16，在命名实体识别F1上分别提升+4.14和+2.64；在未见的Visual News数据集上，CIDEr提升+20.17，F1提升+6.22，表明显著性能与泛化能力。

Conclusion: MERGE通过整合实体型多模态知识库、分阶段对齐和图像引导动态检索，能有效提高新闻图像说明的质量与实体准确性，并在不同数据集上展现出强鲁棒性与域适应性。

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

### [38] [MetaRank: Task-Aware Metric Selection for Model Transferability Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21007)
*Yuhang Liu,Wenjie Zhao,Yunhui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MetaRank：用预训练语言模型把数据集和MTE指标的文本描述编码到共享语义空间，通过列表式学习排序在新任务上自动选择最合适的MTE指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MTE指标效果随任务变化很大，且没有单一指标在所有目标数据集上表现最佳，人工选择常凭经验或历史平均表现，不够鲁棒和高效。

Method: 将指标选择建模为学习排序问题；使用预训练语言模型编码数据集与MTE指标的文本描述到共享语义空间；离线在多元任务上训练元预测器，采用列表式损失以优先正确排序顶端指标；在线阶段基于目标数据集描述高效预测并排名候选指标。

Result: 在11个预训练模型和11个目标数据集上的广泛实验表明，MetaRank能显著提升选出合适MTE指标的准确度，有效帮助在新任务上先验选择最优指标。

Conclusion: MetaRank通过元学习自动为新任务选择最合适的MTE指标，避免了依赖经验或单一指标的不足，提高了指标选择的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

*Haojian Huang,Jiahao Shi,Zhe Liu,Harold Haodong Chen,Han Fang,Hao Sun,Zhongjiang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于原型的可信多视图分类框架，通过用原型表示每个视图的邻域结构，简化视内邻域关系学习并动态对齐视内与视间结构，从而更高效、一致地发现跨视图共识，展示了在公共数据集上的竞争性能与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TMVC方法依赖全局稠密邻域关系导致计算开销大且难以保证视间关系一致性，且通过人工权重聚合各视图证据缺乏在类空间内的一致性保证，降低了分类结果的可信性；因此需要一种更高效且能保证结构一致性的方式来整合多视图信息。

Method: 引入原型表示每个视图的邻域结构，学习简化的视内邻域关系，并设计机制动态对齐视内与视间结构以发现跨视图共识，最终通过一致性的结构学习指导多视图证据聚合。

Result: 在多个公共多视图数据集上进行的大量实验表明，该方法在下游分类任务上取得了竞争性的性能，并展现出相较于现有TMVC方法更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 所提方法通过引入原型表示视图邻域结构，既降低了复杂度又提升了跨视图结构一致性，实验表明在多个多视图数据集上具备竞争性的性能和鲁棒性，增强了分类决策的可信度。

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

*Qirui Yang,Yang Yang,Ying Zeng,Xiaobin Hu,Bo Li,Huanjing Yue,Jingyu Yang,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CameraMaster，一种相机感知的文本引导扩散图像润色框架，通过将摄影指令与精确相机参数显式解耦并融合，实现对曝光、白平衡、缩放等参数的精细可控。采用参数嵌入调制指令与内容语义，并在时间嵌入中注入指令与参数作为条件与门控信号，以在去噪过程中实现统一的逐层调制。构建78K标注相机参数的数据集，实验证明对参数变动响应近线性、支持多参数组合且优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导方法要么依赖模糊纠缠的文本提示，缺乏精确相机控制；要么为参数调整训练独立头/权重，牺牲可扩展性与组合性且难以敏感捕捉微小变化。因此需要一种统一、可组合且对参数敏感的框架。

Method: 设计两条信息流：摄影指令表示与相机参数嵌入。用相机参数嵌入调制摄影指令和内容语义；将调制后的指令通过cross-attention注入内容特征，形成强相机敏感的语义上下文；同时将指令与相机嵌入作为条件与门控注入时间嵌入，实现逐层、统一的去噪调制。并用78K图像-提示对带参数注释的数据训练与评估模型。

Conclusion: CameraMaster能在文本引导的扩散模型中实现精确且可组合的相机参数控制，表现为对参数的单调、近线性响应和显著的定量/定性优越性，适合可控图像润色任务。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CaptionQA：基于下游任务效用评估生成caption的基准。数据覆盖4个领域、33k问题，结果显示现有模型caption不能完全替代图像，存在高达32%的性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成的图像描述（caption）在实际下游任务中的效用，探讨现有评价是否能衡量caption是否能替代图像用于多模态系统。

Method: 设计领域相关细粒度信息类别；为每张图构建大量需视觉信息的多选题；让LLM仅基于caption作答以评估caption对下游任务的支持能力；比较多模态模型在图像与caption两种输入下的表现差异。

Result: 构建CaptionQA基于效用的基准，包含4个领域（自然、文档、电商、具身AI），制定细粒度分类并收集33,027个多项选择问题（平均每图50.3问），通过仅用caption让LLM回答问题来测量caption保留图像信息的能力。评估显示当前顶级多模态模型在caption实用性上存在显著差距，部分模型在传统图像QA表现相近但在caption实用性上差距高达32%。同时公开数据与扩展管线。

Conclusion: CaptionQA证明了仅靠传统指标不足以评估caption质量，需以下游任务效用为准；并提供数据集与开源扩展工具以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowerDance提出了一种高效的音乐到舞蹈生成方法，结合MeanFlow与物理一致性约束，并采用BiMamba骨干与通道级跨模态融合，支持非自回归生成与动作编辑，在AIST++和FineDance上在质量与效率上表现领先。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音乐到舞蹈生成方法在生成效率有限，影响高保真3D渲染与角色表现，需在质量与效率之间取得平衡以满足实际应用需求。

Method: 方法上，FlowerDance通过MeanFlow实现少步采样结合物理一致性约束以增强动作合理性；使用BiMamba骨干网络与通道级跨模态融合来实现高效的非自回归生成；同时提供动作编辑模块以便交互性细化舞蹈序列。

Result: 在AIST++与FineDance上，FlowerDance在运动质量指标与生成效率（推理速度、内存占用）上均优于现有方法，展示了少采样步数下也能生成物理合理且富有表现力的舞蹈动作。

Conclusion: FlowerDance在保证物理合理性与艺术表现力的同时，显著提升了生成速度与内存利用，实验证明在AIST++与FineDance数据集上达到了最优或接近最优的效果，并支持交互式动作编辑。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 提升肺结节CT扫描分析在描述结节形态和融入医学专业知识方面的准确性与临床适用性；探索协同多代理系统在病理学应用中的潜力。

Method: 将诊断流程拆分为三个顺序模块：Nodule Spotter协调检测模型定位结节；Radiologist对局部区域进行图像描述并生成CT报告；Doctor Agent System结合图像、报告、病理知识库和多代理框架进行恶性度推理。

Result: 提出LungNoduleAgent——一个分为结节检测（Nodule Spotter）、放射科医生描述（Radiologist）和医生推理系统（Doctor Agent System）三模块的协同多代理系统；在两个私有数据集和LIDC-IDRI上优于主流视觉-语言模型、代理系统和专家模型。

Conclusion: 区域级语义对齐与多代理协作能显著提升肺结节诊断的准确性与可解释性，LungNoduleAgent有望作为临床辅助分析的基础工具。

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

*Hakki Motorcu,Mujdat Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种将生成模型（扩散+ControlNet）与稠密物理约束相结合的方法，用以解决空间可变图像去模糊问题；通过高维压缩核描述退化场来精确建模细微运动和模糊变化，并以此条件化扩散过程，在物理准确性和感知真实性间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有两类主流方法各有短板：模型驱动方法往往过度平滑或出现伪影，生成模型尽管感知质量高但会幻想细节。为此需同时保持物理一致性与感知真实感。

Method: 将退化场表示为高维压缩核的连续场，使用该描述场作为ControlNet条件输入以引导扩散模型的采样；结合物理约束和生成先验实现去模糊。

Result: 在大规模实验中，本方法在视觉质量与物理准确性两方面均超过多种最先进基线，尤其在极端模糊和噪声条件下表现显著。

Conclusion: 方法在处理严重模糊且噪声显著的图像时，同时优于基于物理模型的深度展开方法和纯生成模型，能在保真细节的同时减少假象。

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Method: 梯度优化情感token以稳定引导；用语义相似度确定引导时间窗；引入多情感损失以抑制内在及相似情感干扰，整体基于测试时缩放类策略，无需额外模型微调或专门数据

Result: 提出MUSE——无需更新扩散模型或特定情感数据集，基于类似Test-Time Scaling策略的统一框架，实现情感生成与编辑

Conclusion: MUSE为情感合成建立新范式，在保持内容与文本提示一致性及情感真实表达间取得平衡，优于现有方法

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Conclusion: T-NIG能在时间不规则的序列数据上有效估计时间参数并利用不确定性建模，提高长期脑影像生成与AD预测的准确性与稳定性。

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

Method: 设计多模态迭代感知-推理-行动循环，使用150K多模态工具使用数据集MIRA-Editing进行两阶段（SFT+GRPO）训练，并与Flux.1-Kontext、Step1X-Edit、Qwen-Image-Edit等开源编辑模型配合进行评估

Result: 提出轻量级可插拔的多模态推理代理MIRA，通过迭代感知-推理-行动循环，逐步生成原子编辑指令；构建150K工具使用数据集MIRA-Editing并采用SFT+GRPO两阶段训练，使MIRA能与开源编辑模型结合显著提升语义一致性和感知质量，性能可比或超越部分专有系统

Conclusion: MIRA证明了通过模拟人类多轮交互的轻量级多模态推理代理可以显著改进指令驱动图像编辑任务，为复杂指令的可靠执行提供了有效范式

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

TL;DR: Uses 3D-CNN on sequentially split iris sub-images plus curriculum training with triplet and ArcFace loss to learn robust spatio-spatial-temporal embeddings, improving iris authentication under common degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve robustness of iris authentication under rotation, scale, reflections, blur and exploit spatio-spatial-temporal structure rather than simple point-to-point comparisons.

Method: Split each iris image into a one-dimensional sequence of sub-images, input to a 3D-CNN, train end-to-end with curriculum learning using triplet and ArcFace loss to enforce discriminative metric embeddings.

Result: Proposes a matching pipeline: split iris image into sequence of sub-images, feed to 3D-CNN to capture spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues; use curriculum training with triplet and ArcFace loss to learn discriminative embeddings robust to challenges; trained end-to-end; code available.

Conclusion: The proposed method embeds temporal dependencies into feature space via 3D-CNN and curriculum learning, producing highly discriminative and robust embeddings for iris authentication handling rotation, scale, reflections, and blur.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

*Gayoung Lee,Junho Kim,Jin-Hwa Kim,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种“雕塑化”方法，将带反射的多视图图像翻译为中性无反射的“黏土”图像，结合BRDF分支和黏土引导分支联合训练，显著提高反射物体的法线和网格重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reflective surfaces cause view-dependent appearance that entangles with geometry, making 3D reconstruction difficult. Need to suppress specular reflection while preserving geometric cues to improve reconstruction.

Method: Dual-branch network: BRDF-based reflective branch models specular effects; clay-guided branch synthesizes reflection-free clay-like images to supervise geometry and normal refinement; joint training on synthesized clay images and reflective views.

Result: A framework named Pygmalion Effect in Vision that uses image-to-clay translation via a dual-branch network (BRDF-based reflective branch + clay-guided branch) trained jointly with synthesized clay-like images, improving normal accuracy and mesh completeness on synthetic and real datasets.

Conclusion: Translating radiance to neutral clay-like appearance provides an effective inductive bias that stabilizes geometry learning under reflections, improving reconstruction metrics over prior methods.

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

<details>

Motivation: 解决高效多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在压缩视觉token时信息丢失导致理解能力下降的问题

Method: 1) 计算师生视觉logits的曼哈顿距离并用匈牙利算法在空间维度对齐视觉tokens；2) VLAD：计算文本token与对齐后视觉tokens的亲和矩阵并最小化平滑L1距离；3) VSD：对最终层视觉logits在词表空间的离散分布使用反向KL散度进行蒸馏

Result: 提出EM-KD范式，通过视觉token的空间对齐（曼哈顿距离+匈牙利算法）并引入视觉-语言亲和力蒸馏（VLAD）与视觉语义蒸馏（VSD）两种策略，提高学生模型在准确性与效率上的表现

Conclusion: EM-KD在多项基准上优于已有高效MLLM和既有蒸馏方法（在加入视觉token匹配后），证明了其在缓解信息损失和提升理解能力方面的有效性

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

TL;DR: 提出FaithFusion框架，通过像素级期望信息增益（EIG）在基于几何的3D场景表示（3DGS）与扩散模型之间进行融合，用于可控驾驶场景重建与3D生成，解决过度修复与几何漂移问题。EIG作为统一策略引导扩散修复高不确定性区域，并将像素加权的编辑蒸馏回3DGS，系统无需额外先验或结构修改。在Waymo数据集上达到了NTA-IoU、NTL-IoU与FID的SOTA，6米车道偏移下FID为107.47。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大视角变化下，单纯几何方法或单纯外观扩散都难以同时保证几何精确性与视觉真实感；缺乏像素级、3D一致的编辑准则导致过度修复和几何漂移，因此需要一个统一的、像素级的策略来协调几何与外观的融合。

Method: 方法基于像素级期望信息增益（EIG）：计算每像素的不确定性作为优先级，利用EIG引导扩散模型对高不确定性区域进行视觉细化（作为空间先验），再用像素权重将扩散结果蒸馏回几何表示以更新3DGS。系统为即插即用，无需额外先验或结构修改。

Conclusion: FaithFusion在保持几何一致性的同时提升视觉质量，显著降低几何漂移与过度修复，实验证明在Waymo数据集上取得SOTA性能。

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

TL;DR: DATGN: interpolates missing MRIs, uses bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module to generate future MRIs for early AD prediction; boosts classification accuracies and produces atrophy-consistent images


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: automate learning morphological changes and handle missing temporal MRI data to predict AD progression early

Method: analysis of methods

Result: competitive PSNR and MMSE; classification accuracy improvements up to 16% and 21.25%; qualitative atrophy-consistent images

Conclusion: DATGN effectively models temporal morphological changes and improves prediction/classification using generated future MRIs

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

Conclusion: EntPruner能在保持生成质量和条件一致性的前提下，有效剪除冗余模块，实验在DiT和SiT及ImageNet和三个下游数据集上展示了最高2.22×的推理加速并保持竞争性结果。

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Motivation: motivation

Method: analysis of method, contribution and experiments

Result: result

Conclusion: conclusion

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

Result: Proposes Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE) to enable kernel-level blur learning in deblurring networks by operating in Fourier space, convolving estimated kernel with network features, and using decoupled multi-scale reversible sub-unets; achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring.

Conclusion: FKE能无监督学习物理意义的模糊核，提升去模糊性能并具备处理其他核相关任务的潜力；配套的可逆多尺度结构提高了特征提取效率。

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: TEAR有效发现并利用视频生成模型的时序相关安全漏洞，在多模型上实现显著高于既有方法的攻击成功率，证明了时序评估在T2V安全审计中的必要性。

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

Motivation: 全局原生分辨率视觉编码能提升MLLM能力，但带来更高计算开销。需要一种在保留能力的前提下降低计算与延迟（TTFT）的解决方案。

Method: 提出PVC，包含(i) refined patch embedding支持可变patch尺寸以细粒度建模，(ii) windowed token compression在ViT层级中逐步聚合局部token表示。将预训练ViT重新配置为ViT-UHD，并集成进MLLM架构LLaVA-UHD v3进行训练与评估。

Result: ViT-UHD在多项基准上与MoonViT性能接近，同时在相同MLLM架构下将TTFT降低2.4x；LLaVA-UHD v3在与Qwen2-VL竞争力相当的同时进一步将TTFT降低1.9x。

Conclusion: 本论文提出了Progressive Visual Compression (PVC)方法，通过精细化patch embedding和分层窗口化token压缩，在保持ViT通用性的同时实现高效原生分辨率编码。该方法使得经过改造的ViT（ViT-UHD）在性能上接近更复杂模型但显著降低TTFT，并在LLaVA-UHD v3中表现良好。

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

TL;DR: GridAR在画布上按网格逐步生成多个候选块，早期剪枝不可行路径并固定可行锚点，同时通过检查部分视图重写提示以指定布局，从而在低N下超过传统Best-of-N策略并节省计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接将测试时扩展（如Best-of-N）应用于视觉AR存在效率与蓝图缺失问题：浪费全长计算在错误路径上，且栅格式解码缺乏全局画布蓝图，导致生成多为不对齐提示的候选，无法充分利用扩展算力。

Method: 网格划分的渐进生成：将画布分块并对每一格生成多条候选，早期剪枝不可行候选，固定可行候选为后续解码锚点；提示重写：从部分视图推断可行布局并把该布局注入后续生成。

Result: GridAR提出了一种用于视觉自回归（AR）模型的测试时扩展框架，通过网格划分的渐进生成与布局感知的提示重写，提高有限测试算力下的图像生成与编辑质量。

Conclusion: GridAR在T2I与编辑任务上都表现出显著提升：在T2I-CompBench++上N=4比Best-of-N N=8高14.4%且成本降低25.6%；在PIE-Bench编辑任务上语义保留提升13.9%。

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

TL;DR: 提出AnchorOPT：可学习锚点和值和可学习位置矩阵的两阶段提示学习框架，在多数据集上能带来稳健性能提升，替代固定文本锚点与位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于固定文本锚点（值与位置均不变）在跨任务和训练阶段缺乏灵活性的问题，让锚点和值、位置随任务与阶段动态适配以提升泛化能力。

Method: 两阶段训练：阶段1学习可训练锚点（不使用手工文本），阶段2冻结锚点并联合优化软提示和位置矩阵；位置矩阵根据任务与训练阶段自适应调整锚点与软提示的相对位置。

Result: AnchorOPT introduces dynamic anchor values and learnable position matrix for prompt learning on CLIP, with two-stage training; achieves comparable or better performance and integrates as plug-and-play.

Conclusion: AnchorOPT证明了动态锚点与位置自适应能提高CLIP提示学习的泛化与灵活性，在保持模型轻量的前提下实现或超越含额外模块/正则化方法的性能。

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 NDTokenizer3D，基于多尺度 NDT 和 MSDec 的三阶段标记化方法，将点云转为可被 LLM 使用的场景 token，支持交互提示和多任务解码，在 3D 指向分割、视问答与密集描述上表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何将 3D 场景有效标记化为可被语言模型利用的整体场景 token，以及如何用统一架构处理多种 3D 理解任务并支持交互提示的难题。

Method: 三阶段流水线：1) 从高分辨率点云构建多尺度 NDT 表示；2) 使用 MSDec 逐步融合跨尺度 NDT 特征生成场景 token；3) 将 MSDec 复用为人机交互提示与分割解码器，输出 token 与分割掩码。

Result: NDTokenizer3D 提出了一种基于多尺度 NDT（Normal Distributions Transform）的三阶段场景标记化流水线和多尺度 NDT 解码器（MSDec），用于将高分辨率点云构建为既保留全局上下文又保留细粒度几何细节的多尺度 NDT 表示；通过 MSDec 融合跨尺度特征生成可被大语言模型消费的整体场景 token，并将 MSDec 复用为人机交互提示（点、框、掩码）和分割掩码解码接口，从而统一多种 3D 场景理解任务。

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D 通过紧凑统一的设计实现细粒度、通用的 3D VLM 框架，能显著提升多项 3D 场景理解任务性能，并自然支持人机交互提示。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出UPA-RFAS，一种针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)机器人的通用、可迁移物理对抗补丁攻击方法，通过共享特征空间学习单一补丁，并通过特征偏移、鲁棒性增强的两阶段极大极小优化以及VLA特定损失（注意力劫持和语义错位）提高跨模型和实物场景的转移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗补丁多过拟合单一模型，难以在黑盒或模型变化/实物场景中迁移，故需研究通用且可迁移的物理攻击。

Method: 框架包含三部分：(1) 特征空间目标：引入L1偏离先验和排斥性InfoNCE损失以诱导可迁移的表示偏移；(2) 鲁棒性增强的两阶段min-max过程：内环学习不可见的样本级扰动，外环在此“硬化”领域上优化通用补丁；(3) 两个VLA专用损失：Patch Attention Dominance（劫持文本到视觉的注意力）和Patch Semantic Misalignment（无标签下产生图像-文本不匹配）。

Result: 在多种VLA模型、操作套件和物理执行中，UPA-RFAS表现出一致的跨模型、跨任务和跨视角迁移性，构成了当前强的基准攻击方法。

Conclusion: UPA-RFAS能在不同VLA模型、微调变体和仿真到真实的场景下稳健转移，揭示了基于补丁的实际攻击面并为未来防御提供了强基线。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

*Hanyang Li,Yuheng Jia,Hui Liu,Junhui Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出DCBoost，一个参数免费、可插拔的方法，通过利用局部高置信样本的结构信息，提升深度聚类模型的全局特征结构，从而改善聚类性能。方法先用自适应k近邻一致性过滤选出高置信样本，再基于这些样本设计判别损失以增强类内紧凑性和类间可分性。实验显示对多种模型均有显著提升，能使SOTA基线提高约3%并将轮廓系数放大7倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到局部特征结构通常在同类样本中更一致且紧凑，但全局特征往往边界交织、聚类分离差，因而利用可靠的局部结构信息来增强全局结构可改善聚类效果。

Method: 1) 通过自适应k-NN一致性过滤，选取高置信度样本作为锚点；2) 基于这些锚点构建判别性损失，拉近同类样本、分离异类样本，引导网络优化；3) 将该模块作为参数免费插件集成到现有深度聚类框架中。

Conclusion: DCBoost能作为简单有效的插件显著改善现有深度聚类方法的全局结构和整体聚类效果，具有通用性且不依赖额外参数或标注。

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

TL;DR: 提出BotaCLIP，通过对比学习在不显著增加计算开销情况下把DOFA表征对齐到植物学观测，生成在植物存在、蝴蝶出现与土壤营养群丰度预测任务上优于DOFA和监督基线的嵌入。


<details>

Motivation: 在生态和生物多样性建模中，样本稀缺但有领域知识（植物复样）可用，目标是在不从头训练或大规模计算的前提下，将基础模型的通用表征注入领域特有知识以提升下游任务性能。

Method: 采用多模态对比学习将高分辨率航拍影像与植物学观测进行对齐；在训练中加入正则化策略防止对原始DOFA表现的灾难性遗忘；训练后将得到的嵌入用于下游监督预测器。

Conclusion: BotaCLIP能在数据稀缺场景下通过域感知适配将专家生态知识注入预训练基础模型，显著提升下游生物多样性相关任务表现，同时采用正则化缓解灾难性遗忘并保持训练开销较低。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

Motivation: 解决细粒度动作识别中难以捕捉随时间演化的局部细节问题，提升对相似动作的区分能力。

Method: 1) 文本约束的语义查询从VLM语言分支提取微妙语义；2) 区域语义激活模块用这些查询在每帧捕获动作相关响应；3) 将响应链接为跨帧的动作tracklets以表征时序动态；4) 设计空间与时间层面的多级tracklet对比约束；5) 对文本语义进行任务特定微调以兼顾VLM原有语义与任务偏好。

Result: 提出Action-Region Tracking (ART)框架，利用查询-响应机制发现并追踪局部细节动态，通过区域语义激活模块、基于文本约束的查询、动作轨迹（tracklets）及多级对比约束，实现优于现有方法的表现。

Conclusion: 通过将VLM语义查询与区域响应追踪及多级对比约束结合，ART在多项动作识别基准上优于先前最优方法，证明了追踪局部细节动态对细粒度识别的重要性。

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 本文比较了三种生成模型（DDPM、CFM、MeanFlow），在统一TinyUNet上实验。结果显示CFM在50步下FID 24.15远优于DDPM，MeanFlow单步采样达FID 29.15并显著加速。CFM扩展到图像修复后，在多种mask上PSNR和SSIM显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较不同生成范式在同一轻量网络和数据集下的性能与效率权衡，并验证CFM在图像修复任务的可行性。

Method: 在CIFAR-10上用小型TinyUNet实现三种模型。DDPM与CFM采用多步迭代采样，MeanFlow建模时间区间平均速度实现一步生成。CFM用于inpainting时加入mask引导采样并进行修复感知微调。

Result: CFM: FID 24.15 (50步)。DDPM: FID 402.98。MeanFlow: FID 29.15 (1步)，推理时间降低约50倍。Inpainting微调（CFM）：中心mask下PSNR由4.95增至8.57 dB，SSIM由0.289增至0.418。

Conclusion: CFM在迭代采样下性能最好；MeanFlow实现了可用的一步生成与极大推理加速；基于CFM的修复微调能显著改善修复质量。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partial audio forgery is subtle and hard to detect because attackers alter critical frames while preserving perceptual authenticity; existing methods detect frames independently and miss hierarchical temporal anomalies.

Method: Structure of the paper

Result: T3-Tracer, with FA-FAM and SMDAM modules, jointly analyzes frame, segment, and audio levels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three datasets.

Conclusion: 多层次联合建模能更全面地捕捉局部音频伪造，FA-FAM和SMDAM互补提升帧与段级检测精度。

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: FIELDS combines direct 3D expression supervision from 4D scans with 2D self-supervision and an emotion loss to reconstruct subtle, realistic facial expressions from a single image, boosting expression recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D face reconstruction methods miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth.

Method: Encoder trained with authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D scans plus self-supervised 2D consistency; auxiliary emotion recognition branch with intensity-aware emotion loss to regularize expression parameters.

Result: FIELDS improves 3D reconstructions by supervising encoder with authentic expression parameters from 4D scans and using an intensity-aware emotion loss, producing emotion-rich, realistic expressions and better in-the-wild recognition.

Conclusion: Dual supervision (direct 3D parameters + emotion loss) bridges 2D/3D gap and mitigates intensity bias, enabling high-fidelity, emotion-preserving 3D face reconstruction without sacrificing naturalness.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

TL;DR: Extend LPS to complex-valued CNNs with a projection layer, achieving shift invariance/equivariance in tasks on polarimetric SAR data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to address the lack of shift equivariance and invariance in traditional CNN architectures, which is broken by downsampling and upsampling, by extending Learnable Polyphase Sampling (LPS) to complex-valued neural networks, providing theoretical backing and a novel projection layer.

Method: Theoretical extension of LPS to complex domain and introduction of a projection layer from complex to real before Gumbel Softmax; experiments on classification, reconstruction, and segmentation with polarimetric SAR images.

Result: Extended LPS to complex-valued networks with a projection layer from C to R before Gumbel Softmax; evaluated on classification, reconstruction, and semantic segmentation using polarimetric SAR images, demonstrating improved invariance/equivariance properties.

Conclusion: The proposed extension successfully brings shift invariance and equivariance guarantees to complex-valued CNNs, validated empirically on SAR imagery for classification, reconstruction, and segmentation.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: current benchmarks limited to face deepfakes and single-granularity labels, need diverse AV forgery types and richer annotations

Method: multi-stage hybrid forgery framework; benchmark creation; evaluation protocol

Result: AVFakeBench dataset of 12K audio-video questions spanning 7 forgery types and 4 annotation levels; multi-stage hybrid forgery framework for creating forgeries; multi-task evaluation; benchmarked 11 AV-LMMs and 2 detectors showing AV-LMMs promising but weak in fine-grained perception and reasoning

Conclusion: AVFakeBench fills a gap by providing diverse AV forgery data and evaluations; AV-LMMs useful for detection but need improvement in detailed perception and reasoning.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的LiDAR生成只支持单帧或确定性多帧预测，缺乏交互性和长时域能力，需一种可逐帧生成且能利用条件交互进行长期生成的方法。

Method: 采用自回归逐帧生成策略，从单帧输入递进生成未来帧；结合边界框条件、场景解耦估计模块提升物体级交互生成，并用噪声调制减少误差累积。

Conclusion: LaGen在长时域生成中对滞后帧表现显著优于前沿方法，验证了场景解耦估计与噪声调制对稳定生成的有效性。

Abstract: Generative world models for autonomous driving (AD) have become a trending topic. Unlike the widely studied image modality, in this work we explore generative world models for LiDAR data. Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

TL;DR: MatchGS refines 3D Gaussian Splatting geometry and aligns 2D-3D representations to produce highly accurate correspondence labels, enabling robust zero-shot image matching and large performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based image matchers need large-scale, diverse, geometrically accurate training data; 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) can render photorealistic views but has geometric inaccuracies and biased depth harming correspondence labels.

Method: Extracted from abstract

Result: MatchGS yields geometrically-refined 3DGS correspondences with up to 40x lower epipolar error, supports extreme viewpoint supervision and self-supervision via Gaussian attributes; training on this data gives up to 17.7% zero-shot improvement on benchmarks.

Conclusion: With geometric refinement and 2D-3D alignment, 3DGS becomes a scalable, high-fidelity data source for training robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PathMamba的混合模型，将线性时间的状态空间模型Mamba与Transformer结合，用于提高卫星影像道路分割的拓扑连续性与精度，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer虽然擅长全球上下文建模，但其二次复杂度限制了高效部署；而状态空间模型（如Mamba）在建模长连续结构时高效且线性时间。两者互补，结合可提升道路分割的拓扑完整性并降低计算成本。

Method: 设计了混合架构：在网络中加入Mamba块以顺序建模道路的连续性，配合Transformer块进行全局上下文特征增强，从而兼顾拓扑结构保持与全局推理能力。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上实现了新的最优表现，尤其在APLS（拓扑连续性）指标上有显著提升，同时在计算效率上优于纯Transformer方法。

Conclusion: PathMamba在DeepGlobe和Massachusetts Roads数据集上取得了新的SOTA，显著提升了APLS拓扑连续性指标，同时在计算上具有竞争力。

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

Method: Method

Result: Result

Conclusion: Conclusion

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

*Weitian Wang,Lukas Meiner,Rai Shubham,Cecilia De La Parra,Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HTTM，通过在注意力头粒度进行时间令牌合并，无需训练即可为VGGT带来最高7x推理加速，同时保持高重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT作为首个能一次性联合推断相机位姿、深度和稠密几何属性的模型，依赖全局注意力导致在长序列大场景重建时计算和延迟成为瓶颈。现有token合并方法在不同注意力头间统一合并，导致输出token相同，削弱表示能力，因此需要一种在保留多头特性前提下提高合并效率的方法。

Method: HTTM在多头注意力维度上进行时间令牌合并，即在每个注意力头内部按时间或空间局部性合并tokens，而不是跨头统一合并。合并后再通过头拼接恢复多头特征，从而保留了特征多样性。该方法无需训练、可直接插入VGGT，通过利用头级的空间局部性和时间对应性，实现更高合并率和更低计算开销。

Result: 在GPU评估中，HTTM在不训练的条件下实现了高达7倍的加速，且重建性能仅有微小下降，证明其在推理加速和保持表示能力之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: 本文提出的HTTM在不需额外训练的情况下，通过头级时间合并显著加速了VGGT的推理，最大可达7倍，同时仅带来可忽略的性能下降，解决了传统统一合并导致表示能力受限的问题。

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

Motivation: 当前方法多为两两对齐，难以捕获高阶关系（如XOR）且牺牲单模态任务性能；需要一种既保留成对对应又能建模高阶交互的表示学习框架。

Method: 在传统成对对比损失外加入融合模态对比项，使模态对与第三模态的融合一起嵌入到统一空间；训练中同时学习单模态和融合表示的对齐。

Conclusion: ConFu 能在保持强对齐的同时捕获更高阶的跨模态依赖，适用于检索与分类任务，并支持一对一与二对一检索。

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

Motivation: 在受限计算与功耗的边缘设备上，实现对交通结构（如可移动混凝土隔离带）异常的实时、可解释检测，替代耗能或难以解释的CNN方法。

Method: 管线包括：1) 用SIFT提取并编码图像空间特征；2) 延迟驱动的脉冲（spike）转换层将SIFT特征转换为稀疏脉冲序列；3) 基于LIF神经元的SNN进行分类。训练数据包含真实与合成增强的危险/安全标签帧，部署在消费者级设备上进行评估。

Result: 在6000帧数据集上取得92.3%±0.8%分类准确率，平均单帧推理时间9.5 ms，脉冲稀疏性8.1%，实现亚10 ms延迟的实时性能并可部署于低功耗嵌入式系统。

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN在保持空间特征可解释性的同时，实现了亚10 ms的实时低功耗推理并取得高准确率，适合作为可嵌入硬件的结构安全监测方案，但需更多真实场景验证以确认泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications.

We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Result: Proposes multi-scale feature fusion and patch feature fitting (PFF) approach for robust normal estimation in point clouds, combining feature aggregation and cross-scale compensation to adaptively approximate optimal geometric descriptions across scales, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多尺度特征聚合与补偿近似最优补丁特征，解决邻域尺度选择难题，在合成与真实数据集上均实现了最先进的法线估计效果，同时模型更轻量、推理更快速。

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

TL;DR: 提出Endo-G2T，一种用于时间嵌入4D高斯散点的几何引导和时序感知训练方案，通过深度先验蒸馏、时序嵌入高斯场与关键帧约束流式优化，解决内镜视频视图依赖导致的几何漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内镜视频具有强烈的视图依赖效应（高光、湿反射、遮挡），纯光度监督与几何不匹配导致早期几何漂移，进而在稠密化阶段被放大且难以纠正，需要在训练早期对几何进行锚定，同时保持时序一致性与高效性。

Method: 三部分：1) 几何引导先验蒸馏，将带置信度门控的单目深度转为尺度不变深度与深度梯度损失，采用warm-up-to-cap注入以避免过拟合；2) 时间嵌入高斯场，在XYZT空间用旋转类参数化表示动态，结合轻量正则化鼓励平滑运动和清晰不透明边界；3) 关键帧约束流式优化，在最大点数预算下对关键帧进行重点优化，非关键帧采用轻量更新，提高效率与长时稳定性。

Result: 在EndoNeRF与StereoMIS-P1数据集上相较于其他单目重建方法取得最优表现，证明了几何引导蒸馏、时序嵌入高斯表示与关键帧流式策略在动态内镜场景下的有效性。

Conclusion: Endo-G2T在EndoNeRF与StereoMIS-P1数据集上相比单目重建基线取得了最先进的结果；方法通过早期几何锚定、时序一致表示与关键帧流式优化有效抑制了几何漂移并提升效率与时序一致性。

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

Conclusion: 该工作表明无需修改模型架构，通过链式思维和强化微调可将通用多模态大模型用于精确时空视频定位，性能优于现有专用方法并具备开放词汇泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable MLLMs to reason in latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings as intermediate visual thoughts, overcoming limits of external tools

Method: Three-stage distillation-based SFT + VLPO

Result: Monet-7B with consistent gains on perception/reasoning benchmarks and strong OOD generalization; Monet-SFT-125K dataset created

Conclusion: Latent visual reasoning via Monet improves MLLM capabilities; VLPO is necessary for latent policy optimization; dataset and code released

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning.

Motivation: 探究文本模型中发现的“逆向扩展”效应在多模态（视觉-语言）场景中是否存在，以及视觉干扰的作用机制是否与文本干扰相同。

Method: 构建Idis数据集，系统性地在语义、数目、空间三个维度上添加视觉干扰；在多个VLM上评估测试时扩展效应，分析推理长度与准确率；以推理痕迹(attribute counts)为单位进行定量分析；在Waterbirds等基准上复现并测试缓解提示策略。

Conclusion: 视觉干扰会在不延长模型推理过程的情况下降低VLMs的准确率，逆向扩展现象在视觉领域存在但机制不同于文本；通过分析推理轨迹中的属性计数可以解释这种现象，并且采用特定提示能减轻偏差影响。

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DiverseVAR：测试时向文本嵌入注入噪声并用‘scale-travel’多尺度潜在精修在中间阶段恢复生成，从而在不重训的情况下显著提升VAR模型的多样性并保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: What causes poor diversity in VAR models at test time, and how to improve diversity without retraining or heavy compute?

Method: 两阶段：1) 在文本嵌入层注入噪声以增加输出多样性；2) 采用多尺度自编码器提取粗尺度tokens并在中间阶段恢复生成（scale-travel）以修复质量下降。

Result: DiverseVAR: inject noise into text embeddings at test time and apply scale-travel latent refinement via multi-scale autoencoder to resume generation at intermediate stages, improving diversity while preserving quality.

Conclusion: 结合文本嵌入噪声注入与scale-travel精修，在多样性与质量的权衡上达成新的帕累托前沿，显著提高多样性同时将质量下降降到最小。

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

Conclusion: 本文提出将SAM基础模型引入遥感变化描述任务，以增强区域感知与时序对齐，从而提升描述质量。

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出E-M3RF：一种等变多模态3D重组框架，结合几何（旋转等变编码）和颜色（Transformer）特征，用SE(3)流匹配预测碎片变换，显著提升重组精度并减少重叠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仅靠几何信息在碎片小、侵蚀或对称时常表现不佳，且缺乏显式物理重叠约束，因此需引入颜色等非几何信息与等变特征以及物理一致性的匹配方法。

Method: 每个碎片输入点云（位置+颜色）；位置通过旋转等变编码器生成一致的几何特征，颜色通过Transformer编码；将两类特征融合形成多模态表示；使用SE(3)流匹配预测碎片到整体的变换；训练与评估在四个数据集上进行。

Result: 在RePAIR数据集上，E-M3RF将旋转误差降低23.1%，平移误差降低13.2%，Chamfer距离降低18.4%，在四个数据集（Breaking Bad、Fantastic Breaks、RePAIR、Presious）均展示优异表现。

Conclusion: E-M3RF通过结合旋转等变几何编码与颜色Transformer并采用SE(3)流匹配，有效提升了在合成与真实文物数据集上的重组性能，显著降低旋转和平移误差与Chamfer距离，特别在处理几何信息不足或模糊的碎片时更鲁棒。

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

Motivation: enable real-time image-to-video diffusion on mobile by reducing model size, steps, and optimizing attention

Method: analysis

Result: 270M model, linear hybrid denoiser, time-step distillation (20+ -> 2 steps), mobile attention optimizations, 720p <100ms per frame

Conclusion: MobileI2V achieves fast, high-quality 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices through architectural changes, aggressive sampling compression, and attention optimizations.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

TL;DR: M&B通过跨任务与任务内两类权重合并，并配合有界更新策略，在参数空间直接调整权重，能在不改动架构或目标下显著降低灾难性遗忘并提升CIL性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CIL中灾难性遗忘问题，通过直接在参数空间操作模型权重（而非仅修改数据或损失）以更直接、更低成本地保护旧任务知识，并提高新任务学习稳定性。

Method: 1) 跨任务合并：对所有历史模型权重做平均以统一先前知识；2) 任务内合并：在当前阶段内合并多个模型参数以稳定当前学习；3) 有界更新：在优化目标时限制累计参数更新量，确保新模型与旧模型接近，保护旧知识；4) 将合并与有界更新流程嵌入现有CIL训练管线，无需修改架构或损失函数。

Result: 提出了一种名为Merge-and-Bound (M&B)的增量学习训练方法，通过在参数空间直接操作模型权重进行优化。方法包括两类权重合并：跨任务合并（对所有先前阶段模型权重求平均）和任务内合并（在当前阶段内合并模型参数）。为保证合并可靠性，提出了有界更新技术，最小化累计更新以保存先前任务知识，从而使新模型保持在旧模型附近，减少灾难性遗忘。M&B可无缝集成到现有CIL方法中，无需修改架构或学习目标，在标准基准上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M&B能有效在参数空间通过加权平均与受限更新获得靠近旧模型的新模型，因而减少遗忘并提升增量学习表现，且易于与现有方法结合。

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 提升特征层面的知识蒸馏效果，克服传统自注意力方法在教师与学生特征对齐时的局限，使学生能利用教师特征图的全部像素信息进行更加全面的像素级关系建模。

Method: 设计基于交叉注意力的蒸馏损失，使学生特征的每个像素与教师特征的所有像素建立注意力关联，计算交叉注意力后构建蒸馏目标，无需修改网络结构，仅在训练中加入该损失项进行优化。

Result: 提出CanKD方法，通过交叉注意力实现非局部的知识转移，仅增加一个损失项即可显著优于现有注意力引导的蒸馏方法，在目标检测与图像分割任务上优于最新的特征蒸馏和混合蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 交叉注意力的非局部知识蒸馏为注意力引导蒸馏提供了新的范式，可更充分地捕捉像素间关系，从而提升学生模型的特征表示与下游任务性能。

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

Motivation: Implementation details (preprocessing, augmentation, optimization) overshadow core design, hindering fair comparison and understanding of true performance contributors

Method: Systematic empirical study

Result: Identified design choices that consistently improve detection and achieve SOTA on AI-GenBench

Conclusion: Robust implementation-level best practices improve accuracy and generalization of deepfake detectors and should guide future system development

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems. Our experiments identify a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and enable state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

Motivation: 现有基于像素空间的ReFL需要在几乎完整去噪后进行优化，造成计算与内存开销高、早期阶段无法监督，无法有效改进运动动态与结构一致性。提出PRFL以在潜变量空间直接做奖励学习，克服上述限制。

Method: 在噪声潜变量空间训练奖励模型，利用预训练视频扩散模型对不同时间步噪声表示的处理能力，在整个去噪链上回传偏好梯度，避免VAE解码并在早期去噪阶段给予监督。

Result: PRFL在噪声潜变量空间进行偏好优化，实现了更高效的训练和更好的人类偏好对齐。

Conclusion: PRFL通过在潜变量空间对预训练视频生成模型进行奖励建模，既提高了对人类偏好的对齐效果，又大幅降低了内存使用和训练时间，优于基于像素空间的ReFL。

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

TL;DR: UAVLight: UAV-collected multi-view dataset with consistent geometry and viewpoints but varying natural lighting at different times of day, for benchmarking illumination-robust 3D reconstruction


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address illumination inconsistency in UAV-based multi-view 3D reconstruction by providing controlled, real-world lighting variation while keeping geometry and viewpoints fixed

Method: Introduce UAVLight dataset and evaluation protocol

Result: A benchmark dataset (UAVLight) with geo-referenced repeatable flight paths capturing scenes at multiple fixed times of day, enabling standardized evaluation of reconstruction under varying lighting

Conclusion: UAVLight enables development and fair evaluation of methods robust to real outdoor illumination changes by controlling geometry, calibration, and viewpoints while providing meaningful lighting diversity

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard pelvic fluoroscopy landmark detectors assume AP view; intra-op orientation varies causing performance drop. Incorporate 2D/3D registration into training to make detection robust to pose changes.

Method: U-Net with Pose Estimation Loss and fine-tuning

Result: Compared baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss; pose-aware training improves landmark detection accuracy under variable patient pose.

Conclusion: Pose-aware training (Pose Estimation Loss and fine-tuning) yields more robust landmark detection across realistic intra-operative pose variations compared to baseline U-Net.

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

Motivation: 解决开源生成模型在音视频对齐上的鲁棒性不足，通过分析扩散联合过程中的三大问题（对应漂移、全局注意力不足、CFG的模态内偏差）来提升同步性。

Method: 1) Cross-Task Synergy：用音驱动视频与视驱动音的强监督互补减缓对应漂移；2) Global-Local Decoupled Interaction：解耦全局与局部注意以高效捕捉时序细节；3) SyncCFG：在推理时分离并放大对齐信号以增强跨模态同步。

Conclusion: Harmony在多项实验证明能建立新的最先进水平，尤其在细粒度音视频同步方面取得显著提升，为开放域音视频生成提供了可行的、系统性的解决方案。

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架在小样本与类别不平衡场景下有效提升少数类识别，显示出在临床早期口腔癌诊断中应用的潜力。

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

TL;DR: 提出MoGAN：一种基于运动的后训练框架，在保持图像质量与高效性的前提下显著改善视频扩散模型的运动一致性与真实性。通过对光流进行判别和分布匹配正则化，提升运动评分与人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的去噪MSE目标缺乏对时间一致性的直接监督，导致视频生成在帧级质量高但运动不连贯或不真实。需要一个无需奖励模型或人工偏好数据的方法来提升运动真实感。

Method: 在3步蒸馏的视频扩散模型基础上，训练一个基于DiT的光流判别器以区分真实与生成的运动，同时加入分布匹配正则项以保持帧级视觉质量。

Result: 在Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B上，对VBench运动分数较50步teacher提升+7.3%、较3步DMD提升+13.3%；在VideoJAM-Bench分别提升+7.4%与+8.8%；人类偏好测试也显示MoGAN在运动质量上被优先选择。

Conclusion: MoGAN能在不牺牲视觉保真度与效率的情况下，大幅提升生成视频的运动真实性，在多个基准和人类评估中均优于基线模型。

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个无需全掩码监督、仅用稀疏点注释即可将SAM适配到遥感影像的自提示点监督框架，通过逐步自我提示与语义对齐提升分割性能和域鲁棒性。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

Motivation: GCNs for skeleton-based action recognition need large labeled datasets, which are often unavailable; goal is to reduce labeling needs while maintaining performance.

Method: Propose an adversarial acquisition function for exemplar selection balancing representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty; design bidirectional and stable GCNs that map between ambient and latent spaces to better capture exemplar distribution; evaluate on two benchmarks.

Result: Significant improvements over prior work on two challenging benchmarks, showing effectiveness of the proposed acquisition and architecture.

Conclusion: The paper demonstrates that label-efficient GCNs with adversarial exemplar acquisition and bidirectional stable GCN architectures significantly improve skeleton-based action recognition under limited-label regimes.

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term AQA needs robust modeling of extended temporal dynamics and resistance to contextual confounders; existing methods use costly annotations or unidirectional temporal models leading to spurious correlations and unstable representations.

Method: Counterfactual de-confounding + bidirectional time-conditioned flow

Result: CaFlow integrates Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) to disentangle causal/confounding features and apply counterfactual interventions, and BiT-Flow to model forward/backward dynamics with cycle-consistency, achieving state-of-the-art on long-term AQA benchmarks.

Conclusion: CaFlow通过因果去混淆和双向时序流的协同设计，在长期动作质量评估任务上实现更鲁棒、连贯的表示，达到SOTA。

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

TL;DR: Multi-Crit creates curated multi-criterion annotated response pairs and three metrics to test pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching, and conflict recognition; finds proprietary models struggle with pluralistic consistency, open-source models worse, and critic fine-tuning limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether LMMs can function as reliable, steerable judges by following diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria and producing reliable criterion-level judgements.

Method: Constructed dataset of challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations across open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning; defined three novel metrics; evaluated 25 LMMs including analyses of fine-tuning, scaling, and consistency.

Result: The paper introduces Multi-Crit, a benchmark to evaluate multimodal models (LMMs) on following multiple, fine-grained evaluation criteria and producing criterion-level judgments.

Conclusion: Current LMMs, especially open-source ones, have limited ability to follow diverse evaluation criteria consistently; fine-tuning helps certain aspects but doesn't generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgments. Multi-Crit provides foundations for improving steerable multimodal evaluation.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击在端到端训练和视觉上易察觉补丁方面成本高且效果受限，需更高效且隐蔽的方法针对视觉-语言-动作模型的特征空间进行攻击

Method: Feature-space adversarial attack for VLA models

Result: 在L_inf=4/255约束下，结合Top-K掩码的ADVLA对小于10%补丁实现近100%攻击成功率，单步时间约0.06s，扰动集中在关键区域且难以察觉

Conclusion: ADVLA在特征空间攻击上避免了传统补丁攻击的高训练成本和明显可见性，展现出对VLA模型的高效性与实际价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

TL;DR: 作者通过对比学习训练CamFormer，将摄像机轨迹映射到与自然语言对齐的嵌入空间，验证了仅凭相机位姿序列即可有效预测视频语义，且模型对多种位姿估计方法鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究在不使用像素信息的情况下，仅凭摄像机轨迹是否可感知视频内容，即检验“如何移动”是否能揭示“正在做/观测”的事物。

Method: 提出对比学习框架，训练一个专门的编码器（CamFormer）将相机位姿轨迹投影到与文本对齐的嵌入空间；在多种下游任务（跨模态对齐、分类、时序分析）上评估，并测试不同位姿估计方法（多传感器与仅RGB）。

Result: 实验表明摄像机轨迹是高度信息化的模态，CamFormer嵌入在下游任务表现良好且对不同位姿估计方法具有鲁棒性，证明轨迹作为轻量且稳健的感知模态的可行性。

Conclusion: 本文证明摄像机轨迹本身能揭示视频语义，且通过对比学习训练的CamFormer能将相机位姿序列映射到与自然语言对齐的共同嵌入空间。

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

TL;DR: G^2VLM把3D重建能力直接融入VLM，利用多视图数据学习几何先验，从而在3D属性预测和空间理解推理上表现优异，兼顾可扩展性与语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在空间智能上薄弱，主要因缺乏从2D图像重建3D空间的视觉几何学习过程；G^2VLM旨在弥补这一空白，将3D重建能力与VLM语义理解结合以提升空间推理与理解。

Method: 模型通过学习从2D多视角/视频重建3D几何表征，并将这些几何特征原生地接入VLM，用于直接预测3D属性；在空间理解上采用in-context learning和interleaved reasoning来提升推理能力。

Result: G^2VLM提出一种将3D几何学习与视觉-语言模型结合的方法，通过在多视角图像和视频上训练，学得3D视觉几何特征以支持3D重建和空间推理任务。

Conclusion: 将低层次3D视觉任务与高层次语义VLM统一，可在无需大量人工3D标注的条件下，同时实现与专业3D重建模型相当的重建性能和更强的空间理解能力，具备成为社区基线模型的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

TL;DR: 将多种控制信号合成为单一画布输入，并通过多任务训练让扩散模型联合理解多模态控制，从而在复杂多控场景中显著提升身份保留和控制遵从性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在高保真组合控制与多模态约束下表现欠佳，尤其当文本、参考主体、空间布局、姿势和布局注释等多种控制同时存在时，难以保证身份保留和控制遵从。为此需要一种统一的界面与训练策略，使模型能整合异构控制信号。

Method: 核心方法是将各种控制信号（文本提示、参考主体、空间布局、姿势约束等）编码成一个复合画布图像，作为模型输入；同时构建多任务数据集并引入多任务画布训练策略，令扩散模型在统一范式下学习多模态控制的联合推理。

Result: 在多人物合成、姿势控制合成、布局约束生成和多控生成等基准上，Canvas-to-Image在身份保留和控制遵从性方面显著优于现有最先进方法，且具备更好的多控制泛化能力。

Conclusion: Canvas-to-Image提出了将多模态、多控制信号统一编码为单一画布图像的框架，并通过多任务画布训练使模型能够联合理解并执行这些控制，从而提高了合成图像的真实度和控制遵从性。

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

TL;DR: MorphingDB：在 PostgreSQL 中实现任务中心的 AI-native DBMS，结合迁移学习、灵活模型存储与推理优化，提升模型选择与推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 AI-native DBMS 要么模型中心化需人工维护，要么任务中心化的 AutoML 计算开销大且与 DBMS 集成差，因而需要一种同时低开发开销、紧密 DBMS 集成且高效的任务中心化解决方案。

Method: 引入专用模式与多维张量数据类型实现灵活的模型存储；两阶段的迁移学习模型选择（离线构建迁移性子空间 + 在线特征感知投影）；预嵌入与向量共享消除冗余计算；基于 DAG 的批处理流水线与成本感知调度优化推理吞吐。

Result: 在 9 个公开数据集（时间序列、NLP、图像）上，MorphingDB 在模型选择的准确性、资源消耗和时间成本之间取得均衡，并在推理吞吐与资源效率方面显著优于 EvaDB、Madlib、GaussML 以及 AutoGluon、AutoKeras、AutoSklearn。

Conclusion: MorphingDB 在 PostgreSQL 中实现了自动化的模型存储、选择与推理，兼顾精度、资源与时间开销，在多类任务上优于现有 AI-native DBMS 与 AutoML 平台。

Abstract: The increasing demand for deep neural inference within database environments has driven the emergence of AI-native DBMSs. However, existing solutions either rely on model-centric designs requiring developers to manually select, configure, and maintain models, resulting in high development overhead, or adopt task-centric AutoML approaches with high computational costs and poor DBMS integration. We present MorphingDB, a task-centric AI-native DBMS that automates model storage, selection, and inference within PostgreSQL. To enable flexible, I/O-efficient storage of deep learning models, we first introduce specialized schemas and multi-dimensional tensor data types to support BLOB-based all-in-one and decoupled model storage. Then we design a transfer learning framework for model selection in two phases, which builds a transferability subspace via offline embedding of historical tasks and employs online projection through feature-aware mapping for real-time tasks. To further optimize inference throughput, we propose pre-embedding with vectoring sharing to eliminate redundant computations and DAG-based batch pipelines with cost-aware scheduling to minimize the inference time. Implemented as a PostgreSQL extension with LibTorch, MorphingDB outperforms AI-native DBMSs (EvaDB, Madlib, GaussML) and AutoML platforms (AutoGluon, AutoKeras, AutoSklearn) across nine public datasets, encompassing series, NLP, and image tasks. Our evaluation demonstrates a robust balance among accuracy, resource consumption, and time cost in model selection and significant gains in throughput and resource efficiency.

TL;DR: HIRE是一种结合传统结构鲁棒性与学习型索引预测能力的混合内存索引，通过自适应叶节点、模型加速内部节点、非阻塞重校准与跨层批量加载，显著提升混合负载下的吞吐与尾延迟，并保持稳定性。

Method: 提出混合内存索引结构：混合叶子节点自适应数据分布与负载，模型加速的内部节点并辅以日志式更新，非阻塞的代价驱动重校准机制，以及考虑叶/内部节点误差的跨层批量加载算法。

Result: 在多组真实数据集上，HIRE在混合负载下最多达41.7×吞吐提升，尾延迟降低最多98%，在范围查询吞吐、尾延迟和整体稳定性上均优于现有学习型和传统索引。

Conclusion: HIRE成功在混合工作负载下实现了高吞吐、低尾延迟和稳定性，兼顾了传统索引的最坏情况保证与学习型索引的预测加速能力。

Abstract: Indexes are critical for efficient data retrieval and updates in modern databases. Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of learned indexes, which model the cumulative distribution function of data to predict search positions and accelerate query processing. While learned indexes substantially outperform traditional structures for point lookups, they often suffer from high tail latency, suboptimal range query performance, and inconsistent effectiveness across diverse workloads. To address these challenges, this paper proposes HIRE, a hybrid in-memory index structure designed to deliver efficient performance consistently. HIRE combines the structural and performance robustness of traditional indexes with the predictive power of model-based prediction to reduce search overhead while maintaining worst-case stability. Specifically, it employs (1) hybrid leaf nodes adaptive to varying data distributions and workloads, (2) model-accelerated internal nodes augmented by log-based updates for efficient updates, (3) a nonblocking, cost-driven recalibration mechanism for dynamic data, and (4) an inter-level optimized bulk-loading algorithm accounting for leaf and internal-node errors. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that HIRE outperforms both state-of-the-art learned indexes and traditional structures in range-query throughput, tail latency, and overall stability. Compared to state-of-the-art learned indexes and traditional indexes, HIRE achieves up to 41.7$\times$ higher throughput under mixed workloads, reduces tail latency by up to 98% across varying scenarios.

Abstract: Handling missing data is a central challenge in data-driven analysis. Modern imputation methods not only aim for accurate reconstruction but also differ in how they represent and quantify uncertainty. Yet, the reliability and calibration of these uncertainty estimates remain poorly understood. This paper presents a systematic empirical study of uncertainty in imputation, comparing representative methods from three major families: statistical (MICE, SoftImpute), distribution alignment (OT-Impute), and deep generative (GAIN, MIWAE, TabCSDI). Experiments span multiple datasets, missingness mechanisms (MCAR, MAR, MNAR), and missingness rates. Uncertainty is estimated through three complementary routes: multi-run variability, conditional sampling, and predictive-distribution modeling, and evaluated using calibration curves and the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). Results show that accuracy and calibration are often misaligned: models with high reconstruction accuracy do not necessarily yield reliable uncertainty. We analyze method-specific trade-offs among accuracy, calibration, and runtime, identify stable configurations, and offer guidelines for selecting uncertainty-aware imputers in data cleaning and downstream machine learning pipelines.
