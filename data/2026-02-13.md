*Manuel Hetzel,Kerim Turacan,Hannes Reichert,Konrad Doll,Bernhard Sick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结合去噪扩散与双混合密度网络的概率性HTF方法，能在短观测下给出校准可靠且多样的轨迹预测，并在多数据集上取得强劲表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HTF工作多聚焦于预测精度、社交交互建模与多样性，但对不确定性建模、置信度校准及短观测期下的预测可靠性关注不足，而这些对路径规划与碰撞规避等下游任务至关重要。

Method: 模型基于少样本去噪扩散（denoising diffusion）骨干网络与双重混合密度网络（dual mixture density network, DD-MDN）。通过学习自校准的居住区域(residence areas)和按概率排序的锚路径(anchor paths)，无需预定义锚点或终点，从这些锚路径生成多样的轨迹假设。

Result: 在ETH/UCY、SDD、inD和IMPTC等数据集上，DD-MDN在精度、短观测区间的鲁棒性以及不确定性建模方面均达到或优于现有最优水平。代码公开在GitHub。

Conclusion: 本文提出了DD-MDN，一种端到端概率性人类轨迹预测模型，兼顾高位置信息准确性、校准的不确定性估计以及对短观测序列的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human Trajectory Forecasting (HTF) predicts future human movements from past trajectories and environmental context, with applications in Autonomous Driving, Smart Surveillance, and Human-Robot Interaction. While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

*Yandan Yang,Shuang Zeng,Tong Lin,Xinyuan Chang,Dekang Qi,Junjin Xiao,Haoyun Liu,Ronghan Chen,Yuzhi Chen,Dongjie Huo,Feng Xiong,Xing Wei,Zhiheng Ma,Mu Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABot-M0通过统一大规模数据集、动作流形学习与模块化双流感知，实现对异构机器人和任务的更高效、稳定和可迁移的通用化智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对跨硬件通用化机器人智能的挑战，解决数据碎片化、表示不一致和训练目标错位，推动“一脑多形”范式。

Method: 构建数据管道从六个公开数据集中清洗并标准化为UniACT-6M，提出Action Manifold Learning使用DiT骨干直接预测连续动作序列，并用双流机制融合VLM语义与几何先验实现模块化感知。

Result: 收集并构建了超过600万条轨迹、9500小时数据的UniACT数据集；AML提升了动作预测的解码速度与策略稳定性；各组件独立运行并具有累加效果。

Conclusion: ABot-M0通过系统化数据整理、统一预训练、动作流形假设与模块化感知，展示了在多机器人平台和任务间提升泛化和效率的可行路径。

Abstract: Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于茶LeafBD数据集，结合对抗训练与Grad-CAM，可解释性，EfficientNetB3在茶叶病害分类中达93%准确率，展示了实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工识别茶叶疾病费时且易出错，茶在孟加拉国经济中重要，亟需自动化、可靠的病害检测工具以提高产量和质量。

Method: 构建包含数据预处理、数据划分、对抗训练、数据增强、模型训练与评估及可解释性（Grad-CAM）分析的完整流水线，使用预训练的EfficientNetB3与DenseNet201进行分类，并通过对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在包含5278张高分辨率、7类标签（6类病害+1类健康）的茶LeafBD数据集上，EfficientNetB3达到了93%准确率，DenseNet201达到了91%，并通过Grad-CAM解释模型决策区域。

Conclusion: 该研究提出并验证了一个基于深度学习的茶树叶病分类流程，在茶LeafBD数据集上，EfficientNetB3和DenseNet201分别取得了93%和91%的准确率，表明方法在自动检测茶叶病害方面有效，可为农业管理提供实用帮助。

Abstract: Tea is a valuable asset for the economy of Bangladesh. So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The outcomes prove that the effectiveness of the proposed approach can accurately detect tea leaf diseases and provide a practical solution for advanced agricultural management.

### [4] [Active Zero: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models through Active Environment Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11241)
*Jinghan He,Junfeng Fang,Feng Xiong,Zijun Yao,Fei Shen,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active-Zero replaces passive self-play with active exploration using Searcher, Questioner, Solver to auto-generate curricula from open-world images, improving VLM performance significantly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing self-play for VLMs is passive and relies on static image collections, leading to dependence on initial datasets and inefficiency; agents need active data-seeking to match evolving capabilities and avoid trivial or impossible samples.

Method: Active-Zero uses three co-evolving agents: Searcher retrieves images tailored to model capability frontier; Questioner creates calibrated reasoning tasks; Solver is trained with accuracy rewards. They form a closed loop to create self-scaffolding auto-curricula.

Result: On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero yields 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (+5.7%) and 59.77 on general understanding (+3.9%), outperforming self-play baselines.

Conclusion: Active-Zero demonstrates that active exploration of open-world visual data, guided by co-evolving agents (Searcher, Questioner, Solver), yields better self-play learning for vision-language models compared to passive methods.

Abstract: Self-play has enabled large language models to autonomously improve through self-generated challenges. However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines. These results highlight active exploration as a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems.

### [5] [ReTracing: An Archaeological Approach Through Body, Machine, and Generative Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11242)
*Yitong Wang,Yue Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReTracing结合LLM提示生成、扩散式文本到视频与多主体表演（人+机器人）以及多摄像机三维重建，作为一种考古式艺术实践，用以揭示生成式AI如何在编舞动作中编码并再现社会文化偏见，并提出关于人类身份与AI共在的批判性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨并揭示人工智能如何塑造、约束并生成身体运动，及其如何在编舞层面编码社会文化偏见；同时通过人与机器人、AI之间的交互提出“人类在会移动、会思考并留下痕迹的AI面前意味着什么”的批判性问题。

Method: 从科幻小说中抽取描写人机互动的句子，使用大语言模型把每个句子扩展为成对的“要做/不要做”提示，应用文本到视频扩散模型分别生成供人类表演者与四足机器人执行的动作指导，同时将表演在镜面地板上通过多摄像机运动捕捉记录并重建为3D点云与运动轨迹，形成运动痕迹的数字档案。

Result: 实现了一个沉浸式的多主体表演装置：生成的提示成功转化为可执行的编舞与机器人运动命令，运动被高保真地捕捉与三维重建，形成可供分析的动作痕迹档案；通过展示，揭示并引发了关于AI对身体动作表达影响与偏见编码的讨论。

Conclusion: ReTracing通过将文本生成、视频扩散、机械执行与多摄像机三维重建相结合，提出了一种考古式的多主体表现艺术方法，用以揭示生成式系统如何在编舞动作中编码社会文化偏见并影响身体动作的呈现。

Abstract: We present ReTracing, a multi-agent embodied performance art that adopts an archaeological approach to examine how artificial intelligence shapes, constrains, and produces bodily movement. Drawing from science-fiction novels, the project extracts sentences that describe human-machine interaction. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate paired prompts "what to do" and "what not to do" for each excerpt. A diffusion-based text-to-video model transforms these prompts into choreographic guides for a human performer and motor commands for a quadruped robot. Both agents enact the actions on a mirrored floor, captured by multi-camera motion tracking and reconstructed into 3D point clouds and motion trails, forming a digital archive of motion traces. Through this process, ReTracing serves as a novel approach to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements. Through an immersive interplay of AI, human, and robot, ReTracing confronts a critical question of our time: What does it mean to be human among AIs that also move, think, and leave traces behind?

TL;DR: REVEAL benchmark reveals major blind spots in VidLMs: poor temporal/motion understanding and susceptibility to language/video shortcuts; provides tests and a generator for scalable diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether current Video-Language Models truly understand video content, temporal order, and motion rather than exploiting shortcuts or language priors.

Method: Introduced REVEAL benchmark with five controlled stress tests probing temporal expectation bias, language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and spatiotemporal occlusion; evaluated leading open- and closed-source VidLMs; provided automatic data pipeline to generate diagnostic examples.

Result: Models frequently misinterpret reversed videos as forward, ignore visual content when answering, agree with false textual claims, struggle with camera motion, and fail to integrate temporal cues under occlusion; humans perform well. Public benchmark and code to be released.

Conclusion: VidLMs often fail to robustly reason about temporal sequence, motion, and rely on language shortcuts; humans outperform them.

Abstract: This work investigates a fundamental question: Do Video-Language Models (VidLMs) robustly account for video content, temporal sequence, and motion? Our investigation shows that, surprisingly, they often do not. We introduce REVEAL{}, a diagnostic benchmark that probes fundamental weaknesses of contemporary VidLMs through five controlled stress tests; assessing temporal expectation bias, reliance on language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and robustness to spatiotemporal occlusion. We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease. Alongside our benchmark, we provide a data pipeline that automatically generates diagnostic examples for our stress tests, enabling broader and more scalable evaluation. We will release our benchmark and code to support future research.

### [7] [Advancing Digital Twin Generation Through a Novel Simulation Framework and Quantitative Benchmarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11314)
*Jacob Rubinstein,Avi Donaty,Don Engel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用虚拟3D模型和程序化相机生成合成图像，记录地面真值，运行标准摄影测量重建并与真值量化比较，从而实现可重复的、可量化的重建算法评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统摄影测量中不同设计选择（采样策略、相机配置、特征匹配算法等）的比较通常是定性的，缺乏可控的地面真值来进行量化评估。通过在虚拟环境中生成合成数据并记录精确的地面真值，可进行大规模、可重复的实验来系统地评估这些选择的影响。

Method: 方法包括使用虚拟3D模型渲染合成图片、程序化生成相机位姿（位置、朝向、内参等）并记录为地面真值，然后对合成图像应用传统或现成的摄影测量重建流程（特征匹配、三角测量、拓扑重建、纹理映射），最后将重建结果与地面真值的相机参数和模型进行定量比较。

Result: 提出的流水线允许在受控条件下比较重建相机参数和对象几何/纹理的误差分布，能揭示不同拍摄策略和重建算法在多种场景下的性能差异。作者展示了若干实验，证明该方法能量化重建误差并为摄影测量流程优化提供指导。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个用于从高质量3D模型和程序化相机位姿生成合成图像的新流水线，旨在为基于摄影测量的3D重建方法提供可重复、可量化的评估框架。

Abstract: The generation of 3D models from real-world objects has often been accomplished through photogrammetry, i.e., by taking 2D photos from a variety of perspectives and then triangulating matched point-based features to create a textured mesh. Many design choices exist within this framework for the generation of digital twins, and differences between such approaches are largely judged qualitatively. Here, we present and test a novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and programmatically generated camera poses. This enables a wide variety of repeatable, quantifiable experiments which can compare ground-truth knowledge of virtual camera parameters and of virtual objects against the reconstructed estimations of those perspectives and subjects.

### [8] [Selective Prior Synchronization via SYNC Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11316)
*Ishan Mishra,Jiajie Li,Deepak Mishra,Jinjun Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出将softmax-based selective prior引入SelectiveNet训练的SYNC loss，融合ad-hoc与post-hoc优势，在多个数据集上提升选择性预测并达成SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到现有方法分为修改网络结构/损失的ad-hoc方法（如SelectiveNet）和基于输出概率的post-hoc方法（如softmax response），并注意到post-hoc方法隐含地产生了有用的不确定性信息（selective prior）通常只在推理时使用。作者认为这种selective prior在训练阶段同样重要，因此提出在训练时同步利用它以提升选择性预测。

Method: 提出了SYNC loss，将后验不确定性（softmax response）引入SelectiveNet的训练过程，结合架构/目标函数修改与预测后分析的优点，通过在训练中对选择机制产生的selective prior进行约束或引导，从而提升模型的选择性预测性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100、Stanford Cars等多个数据集上的实验表明，SYNC loss能提升模型的泛化能力和选择性预测性能，超过了之前的方法并刷新了相关任务的SOTA记录。

Conclusion: 该论文得出结论：在训练阶段同步利用后验不确定性（softmax response 生成的“selective prior”）能显著提升SelectiveNet的选择性预测能力和泛化性能，从而在多个数据集上实现或超越最先进的选择性预测表现。

Abstract: Prediction under uncertainty is a critical requirement for the deep neural network to succeed responsibly. This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance.

*Arda Alniak,Sinan Kalkan,Mustafa Mert Ankarali,Afsar Saranli,Abdullah Aydin Alatan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将可带不确定性的单目稠密深度先验高效融入VINS-Mono，通过仿射不变一致性、序关系约束与方差门控，在边缘设备约束下提升鲁棒性和尺度恢复，ATE最多降28.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目VIO在低纹理场景下特征稀缺，导致估计不稳定；稠密单目深度估计能提供补充几何信息，但高性能ViT基础模型计算量大，不适合边缘实时；因此需要一种在保持计算可行的同时利用深度先验提升VIO鲁棒性和尺度恢复的方法。

Method: 在VINS-Mono优化后端引入深度先验项：1) 强制仿射不变的深度一致性约束来利用单目深度的尺度不确定性；2) 加入成对的序关系（ordinal）约束以增强几何一致性；3) 通过深度估计的不确定性（方差）进行门控过滤不稳定区域；并保持计算开销适合边缘实时要求。

Result: 在TartanGround和M3ED数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在困难场景下防止系统发散，并显著提升精度，最大将ATE降低28.3%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出将学习到的单目稠密深度先验融合进VINS-Mono后端，通过仿射不变深度一致性、成对序关系约束及基于方差的门控滤除不稳定伪影，在边缘设备计算限制下实现鲁棒且可度量化的定位；实验在TartanGround和M3ED上证明了可防止发散并将ATE最多降低28.3%。

Abstract: Traditional monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems struggle in low-texture environments where sparse visual features are insufficient for accurate pose estimation. To address this, dense Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) has been widely explored as a complementary information source. While recent Vision Transformer (ViT) based complex foundational models offer dense, geometrically consistent depth, their computational demands typically preclude them from real-time edge deployment. Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating. This approach strictly adheres to the computational limits of edge devices while robustly recovering metric scale. Extensive experiments on the TartanGround and M3ED datasets demonstrate that our method prevents divergence in challenging scenarios and delivers significant accuracy gains, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 28.3%. Code will be made available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入真实流媒体压缩视频数据集StreamSR，提出高效实时超分网络EfRLFN（含ECA和tanh），并证明在该数据集上微调可显著提升模型表现，数据集与代码已开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有实时超分算法和数据集未充分反映流媒体压缩视频的特性，导致评测与实际应用场景差距大，需要真实流媒体数据集和专门优化的高效模型。

Method: 构建YouTube来源的多类别多分辨率压缩视频数据集（StreamSR）；基于Efficient Channel Attention和tanh激活函数设计轻量实时超分网络EfRLFN；对网络结构进行效率优化并采用复合损失函数提升训练收敛；对11个现有实时超分模型在StreamSR上做基准评测，并验证微调效果可迁移至标准基准。

Result: 发布了StreamSR数据集、代码和基准；EfRLFN在视觉质量和运行时效率上优于或匹配同类实时超分模型；对现有模型在StreamSR上微调可显著提高性能并在其他标准数据集上保持泛化。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了面向流媒体压缩视频场景的真实数据集 StreamSR，并设计了高效实时超分模型 EfRLFN，同时展示了在该数据集上对现有模型微调能带来显著提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in real-time super-resolution have enabled higher-quality video streaming, yet existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of compressed video content. Commonly used datasets do not accurately reflect the characteristics of streaming media, limiting the relevance of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset - StreamSR - sourced from YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres and resolutions representative of real-world streaming scenarios. We benchmark 11 state-of-the-art real-time super-resolution models to evaluate their performance for the streaming use-case.
  Furthermore, we propose EfRLFN, an efficient real-time model that integrates Efficient Channel Attention and a hyperbolic tangent activation function - a novel design choice in the context of real-time super-resolution. We extensively optimized the architecture to maximize efficiency and designed a composite loss function that improves training convergence. EfRLFN combines the strengths of existing architectures while improving both visual quality and runtime performance.
  Finally, we show that fine-tuning other models on our dataset results in significant performance gains that generalize well across various standard benchmarks. We made the dataset, the code, and the benchmark available at https://github.com/EvgeneyBogatyrev/EfRLFN.

### [11] [ArtContext: Contextualizing Artworks with Open-Access Art History Articles and Wikidata Knowledge through a LoRA-Tuned CLIP Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11349)
*Samuel Waugh,Stuart James*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ArtContext：收集开放获取艺术史语料并用Wikidata扩充，使用LoRA微调CLIP得到PaintingCLIP，实现对艺术品的语境化注释，实验显示优于原始CLIP，具备可推广性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术史文章经常讨论艺术品的不同方面，但读者难以将这些文章关于某件作品的观点汇集并定位到作品的不同部分。需要一个能够把语料与具体艺术品连接起来的自动化管道。

Method: 构建一个新的语料收集管道，收集开放获取艺术史文章并与Wikidata对齐；基于CLIP使用低秩适配（LoRA）进行领域微调，得到PaintingCLIP；将该模型用于弱监督注释，将文章内容和知识图谱信息关联到具体艺术品。

Result: 训练得到的PaintingCLIP在弱监督设置下优于原始CLIP，能为给定艺术作品提供更相关的语境信息。该管道具有可推广性，可应用于其他人文学科领域。

Conclusion: 本文提出了ArtContext管道，通过收集开放获取艺术史文章和Wikidata知识，使用定制的PaintingCLIP模型将文章信息注释到艺术品上，从而为艺术品提供语境。

Abstract: Many Art History articles discuss artworks in general as well as specific parts of works, such as layout, iconography, or material culture. However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.

### [12] [Latent Forcing: Reordering the Diffusion Trajectory for Pixel-Space Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11401)
*Alan Baade,Eric Ryan Chan,Kyle Sargent,Changan Chen,Justin Johnson,Ehsan Adeli,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 Latent Forcing：在像素空间中联合用不同噪声日程处理潜向量与像素，利用潜向量作为草稿先行计算后生成高频细节，从而兼顾潜空间扩散的效率与像素级端到端建模，在 ImageNet 上取得新 SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜空间扩散虽高效但牺牲了端到端建模优势（丢失信息、需单独解码器、仅建模辅助分布）。目标是在不损失效率的情况下直接在原始图像上建模，兼得像素级质量与潜空间效率。

Method: 在现有扩散架构中引入联合处理潜向量与像素的去噪轨迹，使用分别调优的噪声调度（latent 与 pixel 各自不同的噪声时间表），并按特定顺序施加条件信号，使潜向量作为中间计算的草稿区，随后生成高频像素细节。

Result: 在 ImageNet 上，Latent Forcing 在作者的计算尺度下，为基于扩散变换器的像素生成达到了新的最先进成绩；论文还分析了条件顺序对模型性能的关键影响，并解释了 REPA 蒸馏、条件/无条件生成以及 tokenizer 重构质量与可扩散性之间的关系。

Conclusion: Latent Forcing 在保持潜空间扩散效率的同时直接对自然图像建模，实现了端到端的像素级生成并在 ImageNet 上取得了新的同类最佳结果。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images but lose the benefits of end-to-end modeling. They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.

TL;DR: 利用高分辨率CTA训练单一隐式神经场，从各向异性的SAX CMRI重建平滑、解剖合理的心脏三维形状，在4腔面重建评估中对RV表现优异，对MYO有中等效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAX CMRI的各向异性限制了精确的心脏形状分析，而CTA提供近各向同性且分辨率更高的心脏解剖信息，可作为有力先验用于提升CMRI重建的空间精细度与解剖一致性。

Method: 将CTA作为高分辨率先验，训练一个隐式神经场（neural implicit function）以从CMRI重建任意分辨率的心脏结构；针对右心室（RV）和心肌（MYO）进行重建，MYO同时建模左心室的内膜和外膜；由于缺少高分辨率SAX参考分割，采用从重建形状提取4腔切面（4CH）并与CMRI的参考4CH分割比较以评估性能。

Result: 在4CH切片对比评估中，模型对RV的Dice为0.91±0.07、Hausdorff距离6.21±3.97mm；对MYO的Dice为0.75±0.13、Hausdorff距离7.53±5.13mm。定量与定性结果表明重建形状平滑且符合解剖学，可提升心脏形状分析。

Conclusion: 本论文提出利用近各向同性、高分辨率的CTA数据训练单一隐式神经函数，以联合表示任意分辨率下的心脏形状，从而缓解SAX CMRI的各向异性限制。

Abstract: The anisotropic nature of short-axis (SAX) cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) limits cardiac shape analysis. To address this, we propose to leverage near-isotropic, higher resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of the heart. We use this data to train a single neural implicit function to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. We evaluate the method for the reconstruction of right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO), where MYO simultaneously models endocardial and epicardial left-ventricle surfaces. Since high-resolution SAX reference segmentations are unavailable, we evaluate performance by extracting a 4-chamber (4CH) slice of RV and MYO from their reconstructed shapes. When compared with the reference 4CH segmentation masks from CMRI, our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 and 0.75 $\pm$ 0.13, and a Hausdorff distance of 6.21 $\pm$ 3.97 mm and 7.53 $\pm$ 5.13 mm for RV and MYO, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative assessment demonstrate the model's ability to reconstruct accurate, smooth and anatomically plausible shapes, supporting improvements in cardiac shape analysis.

TL;DR: Ctrl&Shift 用‘移除+参考引导修复’的统一扩散流程加多任务训练和实景配对数据，实现了无需显式 3D 的几何一致且可控的物体级图像/视频操控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何方法需要显式 3D 重建且泛化差，扩散方法虽泛化好却缺乏细粒度几何控制，目标是将二者优点结合，实现不依赖 3D 模型的可控且几何一致的物体操控。

Method: 提出两阶段统一扩散框架：先目标移除，再在显式相机位姿控制下参考引导修复；设计多任务多阶段训练以分离背景、身份和位姿信号；构建大规模实景配对数据集并估计相对相机位姿以提升泛化。

Result: 在多个任务与基准上，Ctrl&Shift 在保真度、视点一致性和可控性方面优于现有方法，成为首个在无显式 3D 情况下兼顾细粒度几何控制与实景泛化的统一框架。

Conclusion: Ctrl&Shift 成功在不依赖显式 3D 表征的前提下，实现了几何一致的目标级别图像/视频操控，兼顾背景保留、视点一致性与用户可控性。

Abstract: Object-level manipulation, relocating or reorienting objects in images or videos while preserving scene realism, is central to film post-production, AR, and creative editing. Yet existing methods struggle to jointly achieve three core goals: background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation, without relying on any explicit 3D modeling.

TL;DR: 提出九向ULF DTI序列+角依赖贝叶斯偏场校正+无需重训的DiffSR超分辨率网络，能在超低场条件下显著改善DTI图像质量及下游白质评估与疾病分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ULF MRI便携且成本低，但在空间/角分辨率和信噪比上较差，DTI尤其受影响且存在跨空间与角域的伪影，需新的序列和校正/重建方法以使ULF DTI可用于临床/研究。

Method: 提出九方向单壳层ULF DTI序列；开发带角依赖性的贝叶斯偏场校正算法；设计无需重训练且可泛化的卷积神经网络超分辨率算法DiffSR；通过合成下采样实验和配对的真实ULF与高场DTI数据进行评估；在合成退化扫描上测试DiffSR对基于白质的阿尔茨海默症分类的影响。

Conclusion: 这篇论文展示了在超低场（ULF）磁共振扩散张量成像（DTI）中，通过一种九方向单壳层序列、一个具有角依赖性的贝叶斯偏场校正算法以及一个无需重训练、可泛化的卷积神经网络超分辨率算法（DiffSR），能够恢复白质微结构和体积信息，并改善与高场DTI的度量一致性，从而增强ULF DTI的可用性。

Abstract: Portable, ultra-low-field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to expand access to neuroimaging but currently suffers from coarse spatial and angular resolutions and low signal-to-noise ratios. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sequence tailored to detect and reconstruct white matter tracts within the brain, is particularly prone to such imaging degradation due to inherent sequence design coupled with prolonged scan times. In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans. We freely disseminate the Bayesian bias correction algorithm and DiffSR with the goal of furthering progress on both ULF reconstruction methods and general DTI sequence harmonization. We release all code related to DiffSR for $\href{https://github.com/markolchanyi/DiffSR}{public \space use}$.

Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) aims to detect and categorize land-cover changes from bi-temporal remote sensing images. Existing methods often suffer from blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling, limiting segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-Branch Framework for Semantic Change Detection with Boundary and Temporal Awareness, termed DBTANet. Specifically, we utilize a dual-branch Siamese encoder where a frozen SAM branch captures global semantic context and boundary priors, while a ResNet34 branch provides local spatial details, ensuring complementary feature representations. On this basis, we design a Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) to aggregate multi-scale features and capture temporal dependencies in a symmetric manner. Furthermore, a Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) refines shallow SAM features, suppressing noise while enhancing edge information for boundary-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that DBTANet effectively integrates global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 提出ARFC，通过自回归次令牌预测实现单模型任意压缩比，并引入MoS与ERGC提高鲁棒性与语义保留，实验证明在多任务、多数据集上优于或匹配现有方法，适合资源受限场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing feature compression methods require separate models for different compression ratios and lack flexibility; need a single model that can adapt to any compression ratio without retraining while maintaining or improving downstream task performance.

Method: Design an auto-regressive compressor (ARC) that performs next-token prediction to achieve arbitrary compression ratios by truncating generated tokens; augment with Mixture of Solutions (MoS) to aggregate multiple compression outputs and Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) to preserve structural semantics during training.

Result: ARFC outperforms existing compression methods across cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval at various compression ratios, and in some cases exceeds performance of original uncompressed features, demonstrating flexibility and effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: The paper introduces ARFC, an auto-regressive arbitrary-ratio feature compression framework that eliminates the need for multiple models by controlling generated tokens at inference; it includes MoS and ERGC to improve compressed quality, and shows superior performance across tasks and datasets, sometimes exceeding uncompressed features.

Abstract: Feature compression is increasingly important for improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, especially in applications involving large-scale or multi-modal data. While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 多模态大模型在开放词汇的人-物交互识别中受限于跨模态幻觉与遮挡导致的信息缺失，需要一种能结合推理与生成以补全证据与减少错误关联的方法。

Method: 构建显式的认知图（建模实体与动作间可能关系），并动态调用工具链（检索增强、图像裁剪、扩散模型）以获取领域知识与增强视觉证据；使用复合奖励在准确性与工具效率间权衡。

Conclusion: ImagineAgent通过结合认知图谱与生成想象，有效缓解跨模态幻觉与遮挡模糊，提升OV-HOI任务的鲁棒性与效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have shown promising capabilities in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (OV-HOI) are limited by cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity. To address this, we propose \textbf{ImagineAgent}, an agentic framework that harmonizes cognitive reasoning with generative imagination for robust visual understanding. Specifically, our method innovatively constructs cognitive maps that explicitly model plausible relationships between detected entities and candidate actions. Subsequently, it dynamically invokes tools including retrieval augmentation, image cropping, and diffusion models to gather domain-specific knowledge and enriched visual evidence, thereby achieving cross-modal alignment in ambiguous scenarios. Moreover, we propose a composite reward that balances prediction accuracy and tool efficiency. Evaluations on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance, requiring approximately 20\% of training data compared to existing methods, validating our robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: 该论文提出了针对X射线血管造影图像的自监督预训练框架VasoMIM，并构建了大型预训练数据集XA-170K，显著提升了血管相关下游任务的表现，证明了领域知识融入SSL的有效性。

Abstract: X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the significant potential of VasoMIM as a foundation model for advancing a wide range of X-ray angiogram analysis tasks. VasoMIM and XA-170K will be available at https://github.com/Dxhuang-CASIA/XA-SSL.

Motivation: 降低PET辐射剂量会导致图像质量下降，利用MR作为辅助信息能恢复高质量SPET，但受多模态融合不一致性和OOD数据不匹配挑战，需要新方法解决。

Method: 提出多模态特征融合模块生成优化的融合特征，并将其作为条件输入扩散模型；采用两阶段监督辅助学习策略：先用模拟的同分布数据学习通用先验，再用体内OOD数据微调以获得特定先验。

Result: 实验表明MFdiff在质感、结构保真和量化指标（如PSNR/SSIM或相应医学指标）上优于当前最先进方法；在OOD体内数据上也具有更好的泛化性。

Conclusion: MFdiff能有效利用MR辅助信息，通过多模态融合模块和扩散模型迭代生成，显著提升低剂量PET恢复质量，且在定量与主观评估上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) offers powerful functional imaging but involves radiation exposure. Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 提出将生成式压缩融入感知导向图像去噪，能在噪声强或分布漂移下比传统失真驱动方法保留更多真实纹理与结构。

Abstract: Image denoising aims to remove noise while preserving structural details and perceptual realism, yet distortion-driven methods often produce over-smoothed reconstructions, especially under strong noise and distribution shift. This paper proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based denoising, where restoration is achieved by reconstructing from entropy-coded latent representations that enforce low-complexity structure, while generative decoders recover realistic textures via perceptual measures such as learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss and Wasserstein distance. Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. We further establish non-asymptotic guarantees for the compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, including bounds on reconstruction error and decoding error probability. Experiments on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks demonstrate consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance.

Conclusion: 提出了FlowAdapt，通过最优传输理论在数据分布和网络层级间最小化信息传输成本，从而实现有效的参数高效域适应。

Abstract: Fast domain adaptation remains a fundamental challenge for deploying multi-agent systems across diverse environments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception. Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an effective approach for monitoring and assessing structural condition by analyzing image and video data. By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata. Results show that integrating LLMs into vision-based SHM, particularly for rapid post-disaster reconnaissance, demonstrates promising potential for improving resilience of the built environment through effective reconnaissance.

Method: 在预对数sinogram上先进行Voronoi分解，将测量数据分解为若干具有不同统计或结构特性的组件；对每个组件分别构建独立的潜空间表征并进行学习与重建；将各潜空间的重构结果融合以生成最终CT图像；在预对数域避免直接对数变换造成的噪声放大。

Result: 在大量实验中，PLOT-CT在预对数域的1e4入射光子级别上相比传统方法提升了约2.36 dB的PSNR，表明其在噪声抑制与细节恢复方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的PLOT-CT在预对数（pre-log）投影域通过Voronoi分解将sinogram解耦为若干成分并分别嵌入不同潜空间，从而强化特征学习、抑制噪声并保留原始信息，最终在低剂量CT重建任务上取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenged by severe noise and compromised data fidelity under reduced radiation exposure. Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PLOT-CT achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining a 2.36dB PSNR improvement over traditional methods at the 1e4 incident photon level in the pre-log domain.

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于层次分割的伪标签增强策略PLESS，通过在语义一致区域内传播涂鸦信息来提升伪标签的可靠性和空间一致性，从而提高弱监督涂鸦注释下的医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ScalSelect：一种无需训练、线性时间的多模态数据选择方法，通过提取指令相关视觉特征并基于主子空间重构误差排序样本，显著减少训练数据同时保持或提升VLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模VIT训练昂贵且数据存在冗余，现有方法要么需要昂贵的训练/梯度计算，要么依赖代理模型或二次复杂度的相似度计算，故需一种可扩展且无训练的数据选择方法。

Method: 通过在目标视觉-语言模型中提取指令高度关注的视觉特征构建样本表示，然后利用这些表示近似数据表示的主子空间，基于主子空间重构误差进行重要性评分，从而以线性复杂度选择样本，无需外部模型、梯度或成对相似度计算。

Result: 在多种VLM、数据集和选择预算下，ScalSelect 在仅使用16%数据时即可实现超过97.5%的全量训练性能，并在部分设置中超过全量训练。

Conclusion: ScalSelect 在大规模视觉指令调优中通过无训练、线性时间的数据选择实现高效性与可扩展性，能够用少量数据（如16%）达到接近或超过全量训练的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDF作为隐式表面表示与Eikonal方程相关，但难以直接高效恢复高频细节，作者转而用物理上等价的泊松方程来利用其线性及解析核的优势。

Method: 提出使用泊松方程作为代理PDE，将形状的隐式场表示为源项（电荷密度）产生的势，通过格林函数导出解析解，并以基函数线性叠加拟合目标SDF。

Result: 在重建高频细节方面优于若干基线方法，即便只用少量形状先验也能更好地还原细节。

Conclusion: 作者提出将隐式形状重建建模为泊松方程的解，通过格林函数得到闭式参数表达，并利用线性叠加从少量形状先验中恢复高频细节。

Abstract: Implicit shape representation, such as SDFs, is a popular approach to recover the surface of a 3D shape as the level sets of a scalar field. Several methods approximate SDFs using machine learning strategies that exploit the knowledge that SDFs are solutions of the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDEs). In this work, we present a novel approach to surface reconstruction by encoding it as a solution to a proxy PDE, namely Poisson's equation. Then, we explore the connection between Poisson's equation and physics, e.g., the electrostatic potential due to a positive charge density. We employ Green's functions to obtain a closed-form parametric expression for the PDE's solution, and leverage the linearity of our proxy PDE to find the target shape's implicit field as a superposition of solutions. Our method shows improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors.

*Ryan Deem,Garrett Goodman,Waqas Majeed,Md Abdullah Al Hafiz Khan,Michail S. Alexiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估三种基于ResNet的脑MRI分类模型在FGSM/PGD攻击下的鲁棒性，发现ResNeXt变体（BrainNeXt）在黑盒场景下最稳健；缩小图像和取消数据增强会显著降低鲁棒性；建议在临床部署前同时考察准确率与对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度学习在脑肿瘤MRI分类中取得高准确率，但在临床部署前需解决对抗样本带来的安全性隐患；因此研究不同模型架构与输入预处理对对抗鲁棒性的影响，以便为可靠的临床应用提供指导。

Method: 使用三种基于ResNet变体的网络（标准ResNet作为BrainNet、ResNeXt变体作为BrainNeXt、带膨胀卷积的ResNet作为DilationNet），对三个预处理配置（全尺寸带增强、缩小带增强、缩小不增强）训练模型，并用FGSM与PGD两类梯度型攻击在白盒与黑盒设置下进行攻击评估；比较模型间的可迁移攻击效果与不同攻击参数（如PGD迭代步数与α）对成功率的影响。

Result: 实验发现：1) BrainNeXt在黑盒攻击下鲁棒性最佳，但生成的对抗样本可迁移性较弱；2) BrainNet与DilationNet相互间更易被对方攻击，PGD在迭代步数和步骤规模（α）较大时效果更强；3) 图像缩小且不进行数据增强会显著降低模型的对抗鲁棒性，即使在干净测试集上表现良好；4) 强调需要在真实部署前同时衡量分类性能和对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 论文结论指出，不同基于ResNet的模型（BrainNet、BrainNeXt、DilationNet）在面对梯度型对抗攻击（FGSM和PGD）时表现出不同的脆弱性与鲁棒性；BrainNeXt在黑盒攻击下鲁棒性最强，而BrainNet与DilationNet彼此之间更易互相攻击，尤其在PGD迭代步数和α较大时更明显。此外，输入预处理（图像缩放与数据增强）对模型鲁棒性影响显著：缩小尺寸且不做增强的训练集会大幅降低鲁棒性，即便未受攻击时的准确率仍高，强调了输入分辨率与对抗脆弱性之间的权衡。总体结论是，在脑MRI分类的实际部署中，应同时评估分类性能与对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in deep learning models for brain tumor classification remains an underexplored yet critical challenge, particularly for clinical deployment scenarios involving MRI data. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将 GR 的几何先验与扩散生成结合，采用分层细粒度与粗粒度差异引导策略，从 GR 生成的参考图像引导扩散重建，显著改善低剂量全身 3D PET 的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 PET 重建受稀疏采样和病态逆问题影响，易导致噪声放大、结构模糊和细节丢失；三维离散高斯表示能高效编码场景结构，因此将其作为几何先验有望弥补常规模型的低通局限。

Method: 先用 GR 从投影数据生成参考 3D PET 图像，再在扩散模型中以层次化的粗细双向引导（粗粒度多尺度差异图校正偏差，细粒度差异用于局部细节修正），使扩散模型在保持全局一致性的同时恢复亚体素信息。

Result: 在 UDPET 和临床数据集（不同剂量水平）上的实验显示，GR-Diffusion 在图像质量提升和生理细节保留方面优于最新方法。

Conclusion: GR-Diffusion 提出了一种将三维离散高斯表示（GR）与扩散模型结合的 PET 重建框架，通过 GR 提供的物理和结构先验引导扩散模型提升低剂量全身 PET 的重建质量。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a critical challenge in molecular imaging, often hampered by noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information. Experimental results on the UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SToRM：通过重要性预测、伪监督与锚点-上下文合并，在大幅减少视觉token（最高30x计算节省）下保持与全token模型相当的E2E自动驾驶性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在E2E自动驾驶中，使用多模态大模型提高了与人的交互能力和处理异常场景的鲁棒性，但引入LLM和大量视觉token导致计算资源消耗大，车载端受限，现有token压缩方法往往牺牲任务性能。

Method: SToRM包含三个核心模块：1) 轻量级重要性预测器，基于短期滑动窗口估计token重要性；2) 监督式训练，利用辅助路径从全token LLM传递伪监督信号；3) 锚点-上下文合并模块，将token分为锚点与上下文，并将上下文合并到相关锚点以减少冗余并最小化信息损失。

Result: 在LangAuto基准上的实验表明，SToRM在相同的减少token预算下优于现有最先进的E2E驾驶MLLM方法，在保持全token性能的同时，最多可将计算成本降低约30倍。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SToRM在减少视觉token的同时，能够保持与全token模型相当的E2E驾驶性能，并显著降低计算成本，验证了其在LangAuto基准上的有效性。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.
  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

Abstract: Emotion is important for creating compelling virtual reality (VR) content. Although some generative methods have been applied to lower the barrier to creating emotionally rich content, they fail to capture the nuanced emotional semantics and the fine-grained control essential for immersive experiences. To address these limitations, we introduce EmoSpace, a novel framework for emotion-aware content generation that learns dynamic, interpretable emotion prototypes through vision-language alignment. We employ a hierarchical emotion representation with rich learnable prototypes that evolve during training, enabling fine-grained emotional control without requiring explicit emotion labels. We develop a controllable generation pipeline featuring multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting that supports diverse applications, including emotional image outpainting, stylized generation, and emotional panorama generation for VR environments. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of EmoSpace over existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Additionally, we present a comprehensive user study investigating how VR environments affect emotional perception compared to desktop settings. Our work facilitates immersive visual content generation with fine-grained emotion control and supports applications like therapy, education, storytelling, artistic creation, and cultural preservation. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过层级实例树整合噪声掩码与跨视图语义线索，Clutt3R-Seg实现了在稀视角与高混乱场景下鲁棒的零样本3D实例分割，并有效支持语言驱动抓取与单图一致性更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在混乱环境下，传统方法因遮挡、有限视角与噪声掩码导致分割结果不稳定，进而影响语言驱动的机器人抓取任务。作者认为噪声掩码本身包含有用的语义线索，若能有效整合多视图与语义信息，可在零样本设置下获得鲁棒的3D实例分割。

Method: 引入一个层级实例树（hierarchical instance tree）来整合多个噪声分割掩码的语义线索，通过跨视图分组（cross-view grouping）和条件替代（conditional substitution）抑制过分割与欠分割，从而产生一致的视图掩码并重建稳健的3D实例；为每个实例附加开放词汇语义嵌入以实现语言对齐；在场景变化时通过仅利用单张交互后图像的一致性感知更新保持实例对应性，无需重新扫描。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上以及真实机器人验证中，Clutt3R-Seg在各种设置下均优于最先进基线；在重度混乱序列上实现AP@25=61.66，较基线提高2.2倍以上；仅用四视图就比MaskClustering用八视图时性能高出两倍多。

Conclusion: 本论文提出了Clutt3R-Seg，一种用于语言驱动机械臂抓取的零样本3D实例分割管线，针对混乱场景中的遮挡、视角受限和噪声分割掩码问题，能够在稀视角下生成鲁棒的视图一致性掩码和可靠的3D实例，并支持开放词汇语义嵌入以从自然语言指令中精确选择目标，在多阶段任务中通过一致性感知更新维持实例对应性。

Abstract: Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

Motivation: 现有自我视角凝视估计主要集中于头戴摄像头，忽视了颈部/替代视角；为扩展可穿戴设备和应用，需要研究颈部摄像头的凝视估计并提供数据基准。

Method: 收集约4小时、8名参与者的颈部摄像头日常活动视频，使用Transformer（GLC）进行凝视估计；提出两个扩展：1) 添加注视越界（gaze out-of-bound）分类的辅助任务；2) 多视角共学习，联合训练头部视角与颈部视角模型并用几何感知辅助损失。

Result: 实验表明：辅助的注视越界分类优于标准微调，提升了估计性能；多视角共学习在该设置下未能带来性能提升。论文对失败的共学习方法进行了分析并讨论了对颈部凝视估计的影响。

Conclusion: 该工作提出颈部摄像头视角的凝视估计新任务，收集了首个相关数据集并评估了基于Transformer的模型；结论是：加入注视越界分类作为辅助任务能提升性能，而多视角共学习未带来额外收益。

Abstract: This paper introduces neck-mounted view gaze estimation, a new task that estimates user gaze from the neck-mounted camera perspective. Prior work on egocentric gaze estimation, which predicts device wearer's gaze location within the camera's field of view, mainly focuses on head-mounted cameras while alternative viewpoints remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains. We further analyze these results and discuss implications for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

Conclusion: 该论文提出的TD-FusionUNet在轻量化与计算效率之间取得良好平衡，适合资源受限环境中的次日野火蔓延预测。

Abstract: We developed a lightweight and computationally efficient tool for next-day wildfire spread prediction using multimodal satellite data as input. The deep learning model, which we call Transform Domain Fusion UNet (TD-FusionUNet), incorporates trainable Hadamard Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform layers that apply two-dimensional transforms, enabling the network to capture essential "frequency" components in orthogonalized latent spaces. Additionally, we introduce custom preprocessing techniques, including random margin cropping and a Gaussian mixture model, to enrich the representation of the sparse pre-fire masks and enhance the model's generalization capability. The TD-FusionUNet is evaluated on two datasets which are the Next-Day Wildfire Spread dataset released by Google Research in 2023, and WildfireSpreadTS dataset. Our proposed TD-FusionUNet achieves an F1 score of 0.591 with 370k parameters, outperforming the UNet baseline using ResNet18 as the encoder reported in the WildfireSpreadTS dataset while using substantially fewer parameters. These results show that the proposed latent space fusion model balances accuracy and efficiency under a lightweight setting, making it suitable for real time wildfire prediction applications in resource limited environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-shape retrieval methods need canonical poses and cover few categories, so they fail when objects are in arbitrary orientations across diverse classes; need rotation-invariant representations scalable to many categories.

Method: Define global and local reference frames for pose disentanglement; use Hilbert sorting to build rotation-invariant token sequences; compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate via feature-wise linear modulation; use state-space model backbone and cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation for scalable training.

Result: Demonstrated superior representational capacity and robustness; achieved SOTA on OmniObject3D over 200+ categories in arbitrary orientations; linear-time orientational embedding compatible with state-space models.

Conclusion: RI-Mamba successfully achieves rotation-invariant text-to-shape retrieval by disentangling pose and geometry, leveraging reference frames, Hilbert sorting, and orientational embeddings, resulting in state-of-the-art performance on OmniObject3D.

Abstract: 3D assets have rapidly expanded in quantity and diversity due to the growing popularity of virtual reality and gaming. As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations.

Method: 构建并整理单中心99,349帧DSA数据集，使用将解剖与采集几何信息编码为文本嵌入的条件LDM进行训练，按语义条件（循环类型与位姿）生成动脉期DSA帧；用FID和专家主观评分评估生成图像质量。

Result: 专家对400张合成图像按近端大中小外周血管分级的总体Likert评分为3.1–3.3（5分制），评审间ICC=0.80–0.87，表明一致性高；FID中位数为15.27，显示与真实帧的分布相似性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的语义条件潜变量扩散模型（LDM）能在动脉期脑血管造影（DSA）图像生成中按解剖循环（前/后循环）和C形臂位姿进行显式控制，能生成临床上接近真实的合成图像，适用于算法开发、研究与培训。

Abstract: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease, yet its invasive nature and high acquisition cost severely limit large-scale data collection and public data sharing. Therefore, we developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) that synthesizes arterial-phase cerebral DSA frames under explicit control of anatomical circulation (anterior vs.\ posterior) and canonical C-arm positions. We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87). Distributional similarity to real DSA frames was supported by a low median Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 15.27. Our results indicate that semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSAs suitable for downstream algorithm development, research, and training.

Motivation: 现有将3D Gaussian Splatting应用于CT的工作在超稀疏视角和动态运动场景中容易出现严重伪影与时间不一致性，需引入几何感知与时空建模以提升重建鲁棒性。

Method: 提出基于几何感知高斯变形的框架：使用多分辨率哈希编码器对高斯基元参数进行局部先验正则化，并通过时序条件表示、时空注意力模块与运动场网络实现动态场景的时间一致性与细粒度呼吸运动建模。

Conclusion: TG-Field有效缓解了超稀疏投影与动态运动下的伪影问题，在静态与动态CT重建中均取得优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene representation with superior efficiency and quality. While recent adaptations for computed tomography (CT) show promise, they struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose Tomographic Geometry Field (TG-Field), a geometry-aware Gaussian deformation framework tailored for both static and dynamic CT reconstruction. A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence. In addition, a motion-flow network models fine-grained respiratory motion to track local anatomical deformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TG-Field consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法或将跟踪与映射耦合成统一场景导致高计算量，或松耦合引入冗余；需要一种实时且高质量的方法将VO与基于高斯的场景表示高效结合。

Method: 在EM框架内对VO提供的半稠密深度与Gaussian Splatting表示进行联合优化；提出Gaussian Splat Initialization，利用图像、关键帧位姿与VO像素关联生成接近最终场景的高质量高斯初始化，省去启发式方法。

Result: 在大量实验中，方法实现实时运行，并在重建的几何/光度保真度及位姿跟踪精度上达到或超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: GSO-SLAM通过双向耦合VO与GS，在EM框架下实现联合优化，达成实时、高质量的单目密集SLAM重建与跟踪，避免额外计算开销并提升几何/光度保真度与跟踪精度。

Abstract: We propose GSO-SLAM, a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that leverages Gaussian scene representation. Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出将坐标预测转为实例ID视觉提示并结合强化学习奖励的STVG-R1框架，显著提升STVG性能并具备零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM在处理时空视频定位任务时容易出现文本与可视坐标不一致导致的幻觉；以往通过增强对齐或附加解码器的方法增加了标注和计算开销。作者寻求一种无需额外训练模块、可解释且计算高效的解决方案。

Method: 核心方法包括：1) 将坐标预测转化为实例ID识别，对每个对象分配唯一且时间一致的ID，并将ID以视觉提示的形式嵌入视频帧；2) 引入STVG-R1强化学习框架，设计任务驱动的奖励函数，联合优化时间精度、空间一致性与格式正则化；3) 基于现有VLM（例如Qwen2.5-VL-7B）进行微调或提示式输入，不添加额外可训练模块。

Result: 在六个基准上进行评估，STVG-R1在HCSTVG-v2上m_IoU比Qwen2.5-VL-7B高20.9%，在MeViS的多目标引用视频对象分割零样本任务上达到47.3% J&F，表现出强泛化能力并创下SOTA。

Conclusion: 本文提出通过将每帧坐标预测重写为实例级ID识别，并将ID作为视觉提示嵌入视频，避免跨模态坐标对齐，结合强化学习奖励优化时空和结构一致性，从而缓解VLM在STVG任务中的幻觉问题。实验表明该方法在六个数据集上显著优于基线，尤其在HCSTVG-v2上m_IoU提升20.9%，并在MeViS上实现47.3% J&F的零样本泛化SOTA。

Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates often induces hallucinations. This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA). Surprisingly, STVG-R1 also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation tasks, achieving a SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

Motivation: 电商产品理解天然需要从文本、图像和结构化属性中进行强多模态理解，但现有通用VLM缺乏针对电商属性中心、多图像和噪声数据的适配方法。

Method: 通过大规模实验研究，设计并评估了针对属性中心、多图像和噪声数据特性的适配策略，并提出了一个覆盖深度产品理解、严格指令遵循和动态属性抽取的评估套件。

Conclusion: 针对通用VLM进行有针对性的适配可以在不损害广泛多模态能力的前提下，显著提升电商场景下的产品理解性能。

Abstract: E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

TL;DR: 通过去除显著视觉证据构建物体对齐辅助视图，增强VCD对虚幻令牌的抑制，低成本、可插拔，显著降低MLLMs的物体虚幻问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉理解生成时常出现物体虚幻（hallucination），即生成未被图像支持的物体描述。通过在对比解码中加入更有针对性的辅助视图，可以增强模型对图像-文本一致性的判别能力，减少虚幻。

Method: 利用自监督Vision Transformer中的物体中心注意力，去除最显著的视觉证据以生成辅助视图，从而破坏对无支持文本令牌的视觉支撑并增强对比信号。方法为prompt-agnostic、model-agnostic，可无缝插入现有VCD流水线，仅需一次可缓存的前向计算，计算开销极小。

Result: 在两个流行的物体虚幻基准上、针对两种MLLMs，所提方法均表现出一致提升，证明了方法的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: 本文提出通过构建与物体对齐的辅助视图改进视觉对比解码(VCD)，有效减少多模态大模型(MLLMs)中的物体虚幻问题。

Abstract: We study object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve visual contrastive decoding (VCD) by constructing an object-aligned auxiliary view. We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass. Empirically, our method demonstrates consistent gains on two popular object hallucination benchmarks across two MLLMs.

*Xiangyu Wu,Dongming Jiang,Feng Yu,Yueying Tian,Jiaqi Tang,Qing-Guo Chen,Yang Yang,Jianfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用带类自适应参数的Tsallis熵替换Shannon熵以去偏，ADTE无需额外调参即可提升CLIP测试时自适应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法在CLIP等视觉-语言模型上使用Shannon熵测量不确定性，但由于预训练数据严重不平衡导致预测偏差，使得Shannon熵的置信估计不可靠，因此需要一种能刻画偏置分布的熵度量。

Method: 提出将Tsallis熵推广为Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE)，为每个类别根据持续到来的测试样本估计的标签偏差归一化生成类特定参数q^l，并结合标签调整策略进行测试时自适应；也指出TE和ADTE可直接替代Shannon熵用于不需额外修改的TTA方法。

Result: 在ImageNet及其五个变体上，ADTE优于最新方法；在10个跨域基准上取得最高平均性能，且对不同模型架构和文本提示鲁棒。

Conclusion: ADTE通过引入基于Tsallis熵的自适应去偏机制，有效应对CLIP预训练带来的类不平衡偏差，从而在测试时更可靠地选择高置信样本并提升自适应性能。

Abstract: Mainstream Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for adapting vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, typically rely on Shannon Entropy (SE) at test time to measure prediction uncertainty and inconsistency. However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jinx630/ADTE.

Motivation: 当前基于代码的生成方法多聚焦静态3D场景，难以扩展到包含时间维度的4D动力学场景；存在局部对象结构与全局环境布局难以兼顾，以及开环代码生成导致物理幻觉与动力学不一致的问题。

Method: 双流架构：一流负责检索增强的对象生成，另一流负责分层环境编排；物理感知闭环机制：PostProcess Agent负责编写动态脚本，结合VLM-Motion Critic进行自我反思与迭代代码优化。

Result: 在Code4D基准上相比基线取得41% SGS提升和49%更高的Richness指标，同时能够生成有物理意识的动态行为，这在此前静态方法中未见。

Abstract: Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) achieve impressive universal segmentation performance but require massive datasets (e.g., 11M images) and rely solely on RGB inputs. Recent efficient variants reduce computation but still depend on large-scale training. We propose a lightweight RGB-D fusion framework that augments EfficientViT-SAM with monocular depth priors. Depth maps are generated with a pretrained estimator and fused mid-level with RGB features through a dedicated depth encoder. Trained on only 11.2k samples (less than 0.1\% of SA-1B), our method achieves higher accuracy than EfficientViT-SAM, showing that depth cues provide strong geometric priors for segmentation.

Motivation: 动机是利用FDSL作为免人工标注、无隐私伦理问题的无限合成数据源，但发现现有3D分形生成方法在速度和样本质量（尤其是对下游任务有用性）上存在问题，需改进生成与筛选机制以提高预训练效果。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are being recognized in the deep learning realm as a valuable alternative to exhaustively labeled real data. One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.

Motivation: 现有VLA尽管基于预训练VLM取得进展，但样本效率和泛化仍差，作者认为是因为预训练视觉表征对环境理解和策略先验支持不足，需寻找更适合下游控制任务的表征。

Method: 通过对比分析不同预训练视觉表征（语言-图像对比、图像自监督、视频预测性嵌入）的能力，作者发现视频预测嵌入更擅长丢弃不可预测的环境因素并编码任务相关的时序动态；基于此提出JEPA-VLA方法，将预测性嵌入自适应地集成到现有VLA架构中，并在多个模拟和真实机器人基准上进行实验验证。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

Abstract: Dynamic reconstruction has achieved remarkable progress, but there remain challenges in monocular input for more practical applications. The prevailing works attempt to construct efficient motion representations, but lack a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework, suffering from either holistic temporal optimization or coupled hierarchical spatial composition. To this end, we propose WorldTree, a unified framework comprising Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) that enables coarse-to-fine optimization based on the inheritance-based partition tree structure for hierarchical temporal decomposition, and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) that recursively query ancestral hierarchical structure to provide complementary spatial dynamics while specializing motion representations across ancestral nodes. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves 8.26% improvement of LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% improvement of mLPIPS on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

*Chenru Wang,Beier Zhu,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出训练外梯度校正PMI和轻量编辑校正mimic-CFG，稳定Rectified-Flow反演、提升重建与编辑质量并减少推理开销，在PIE-Bench上达成SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RF-based反演方法存在跨步累积误差，导致速度场不稳定，从而降低重建和编辑质量，需要一种无需训练即可稳定速度场的方法。

Method: 提出Proximal-Mean Inversion（PMI），对速度场做训练外梯度校正，使速度趋向历史速度的运行平均值，并受理论推导出的球面高斯约束；提出mimic-CFG，在编辑时在当前速度与其投影到历史均值之间插值以平衡编辑效果与结构一致性。

Result: 在PIE-Bench上大量实验表明，PMI与mimic-CFG显著改善反演稳定性、图像重建质量与编辑保真度，同时减少神经网络评估次数，实现更高效率与理论依据的性能提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出PMI和mimic-CFG，有效提升RF-based模型的inversion稳定性与编辑质量，并减少神经函数评估次数，实现了PIE-Bench上的SOTA表现。

Abstract: Rectified-Flow (RF)-based generative models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to traditional diffusion models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench demonstrate that our methods significantly improve inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity, while reducing the required number of neural function evaluations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

TL;DR: 将推理时的缩放策略移到训练时，通过区域级蒸馏让单次前向传播具备细粒度识别能力，兼顾精度与速度，并在新建的ZoomBench上验证效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大模型在细粒度感知上受限，因为关键信息较小且易被全局背景淹没；现有的‘Thinking-with-Images’方法虽能改善表现但在推理时带来高延迟与重复视觉编码开销。

Method: 先用强教师模型在微裁剪区域（micro-cropped regions）上生成高质量的VQA监督数据（即‘思考-图像’风格的多轮缩放生成数据），然后将这些基于区域的监督蒸馏回完整图像上，训练小学生模型以在单次前向传播中恢复区域级信息。

Result: 经由Region-to-Image Distillation训练后的小模型在多个细粒度感知基准（包括作者构建的ZoomBench）上取得领先表现，同时在视觉推理与GUI代理等通用多模态认知任务上也有所提升，表明该方法能在保留‘缩放’优势的同时降低推理成本。

Conclusion: 本文提出了Region-to-Image Distillation，通过在训练阶段将“缩放查看”能力内化，使得模型在推理时无需反复调用工具即可实现细粒度视觉感知，从而在性能与延迟之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass. Our code is available at https://github.com/inclusionAI/Zooming-without-Zooming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视角扩散模型难以从文本、BEV和边界框生成具有地点感知性和背景一致性的城市场景，限制了其在视觉地点识别数据增强上的应用。需要一种能控制地点背景一致性的生成方法。

Method: 设计place-ID控制器，包含线性映射、Perceiver Transformer和对比学习，将地点ID嵌入映射至固定CLIP空间；结合多视图扩散模型接受文本、BEV地图和目标边界框，生成背景一致且可变前景的城市街景图像。

Result: 实验证明DiffPlace在图像生成质量和为视觉地点识别训练提供的增强数据上优于现有方法，包含定量比较和增强训练评估。

Conclusion: 该论文提出DiffPlace，通过引入place-ID控制器实现地点可控的多视角图像生成，提升背景一致性和地点相关性，从而支持视觉地点识别任务的数据增强与训练。

Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in realistic image synthesis, with diffusion models excelling in quality and stability. Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition. Our results highlight the potential of generative models in enhancing scene-level and place-aware synthesis, providing a valuable approach for improving place recognition in autonomous driving

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过基于非理想探测器响应的物理正向模型及展开网络，利用自然图像生成合成训练数据，提出无需真实临床数据也能有效去环的CT伪影校正方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习去环方法依赖大量专用训练数据，且通常只在图像域或正弦图域进行修正，忽视了CT前向成像几何造成的域间关联。为降低数据采集成本并利用物理模型提升泛化能力，提出联合物理模型与合成数据的训练策略。

Method: 构建了包含非理想探测器响应模型和线性正向投影（考虑CT几何）的物理前向模型，将RAR任务视为逆问题并通过可展开网络（unrolled network）求解。利用从自然图像生成的合成带环伪影的正弦图和重建图像对进行监督训练，网络学习图像域与正弦图域之间的内在相关性。

Result: 在多种扫描几何与解剖部位的广泛评估中，基于合成数据训练的模型在去环伪影任务上持续优于现有最先进方法，且不需真实临床数据即可获得良好效果。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于非理想探测器响应理论分析并结合CT几何正向投影的去环伪影（RAR）重构方法。通过将问题重写为一个展开网络的逆问题，并利用合成数据从图像和正弦图域的内在相关性进行联合学习，方法能在不依赖真实临床数据的情况下去除环状伪影。

Abstract: Defective and inconsistent responses in CT detectors can cause ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them unusable for clinical purposes. In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Built on DynaHOI-Gym, we release DynaHOI-10M, a large-scale benchmark with 10M frames and 180K hand capture trajectories, whose target motions are organized into 8 major categories and 22 fine-grained subcategories. We also provide a simple observe-before-act baseline (ObAct) that integrates short-term observations with the current frame via spatiotemporal attention to predict actions, achieving an 8.1% improvement in location success rate.

Motivation: 临床LGE影像分割标注稀缺阻碍自动化分割模型发展，作者希望通过无须额外人工标注的合成数据增强来改善分割性能。

Method: 先训练INRs以学习连续空间的LGE影像及心肌/纤维化分割掩码的表示，再将每个INR压缩为紧凑的潜在嵌入；在潜在空间上训练扩散模型以生成新的嵌入，最后解码为合成影像与结构一致的分割掩码。

Result: 在133例心脏MRI数据上实验，加入200例合成体积作为数据增强后，纤维化分割Dice从0.509提升到0.524；提示合成数据能带来轻微但有益的性能提升。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于隐式神经表示（INRs）与去噪扩散模型相结合的合成框架，用于生成LGE心肌晚期增强影像及其对应的分割掩码，从而缓解标注数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the clinical standard for myocardial scar assessment, but limited annotated datasets hinder the development of automated segmentation methods. We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available.

TL;DR: 作者构建了一个面向法语难例的PDF到Markdown转换基准，使用模型不一致采样挑选复杂页面，采用单元测试式评估并对展示差异进行规范化；评测15个模型，发现专有模型在手写与表单上更鲁棒，开源模型在常规印刷布局仍有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准偏重英语或中文，且过度惩罚与下游无关的格式化和线性化差异；需要一个更贴近实际RAG应用、关注解析错误如何影响检索和上游生成的法语难例基准。

Method: 从60,000份文档中采用模型不一致采样挑选难例（手写表单、复杂布局、密集表格、图形密集页），构建法语基准；设计单元测试式检查目标具体失败模式（文本存在性、阅读顺序、本地表格约束），并针对类别做特定的规范化以减轻仅与展示相关的差异对评估的影响；在15个模型上进行比较评估。

Conclusion: 该论文提出并评估了一个针对法语难例的PDF到Markdown转换基准，强调在RAG管道中文档解析的重要性，并通过单元测试式的评价方法更准确衡量模型在实际下游任务中的表现。

Abstract: This report evaluates PDF-to-Markdown conversion using recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging French documents. Document parsing is a critical step for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where transcription and layout errors propagate to downstream retrieval and grounding. Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.
  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗影像辅助决策中，除了准确率外，预测置信度必须与预测是否正确相关联，以便临床医生能识别不可靠输出并进行人工复核，而现有深度学习模型常出现误判且过于自信的情况（误校准）。

Method: 方法包括两部分：1) 训练时设计CUB-Loss，对高置信但错误的预测和低置信但正确的预测施加惩罚，直接将不确定性与预测正确性联系起来；2) 后处理采用DTS策略，对预测概率分布进行双温度缩放以改善后验的校准和可解释性。整体框架基于贝叶斯深度学习以获取不确定性分布。

Result: 在肺炎筛查、糖尿病视网膜病变检测和皮肤病变识别三种不同医疗影像任务上进行了验证。实验表明该方法在多模态上均能一致提升校准效果，在小样本和严重类别不平衡情形下也保持稳健性能，适合临床部署前的可靠性提升。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一个基于贝叶斯深度学习的可推广概率优化框架，通过在训练阶段引入CUB-Loss（置信-不确定性边界损失）和在后处理阶段采用双温度缩放（DTS）进行校准，旨在使不确定性估计与预测正确性对齐，从而提高医疗影像决策系统的可靠性。

Abstract: In critical decision support systems based on medical imaging, the reliability of AI-assisted decision-making is as relevant as predictive accuracy. Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.

Conclusion: 该文提出SCoT框架，通过将空间链式思维与扩散模型结合，提升复杂空间推理能力并保持生成质量。

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in aesthetic image synthesis, they often struggle with complex spatial understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve fine-grained activity recognition in newborn resuscitation videos using generative AI methods to address shortcomings of 3D-CNNs and ViT approaches.

Method: Compared zero-shot VLM strategies and fine-tuned local vision-language models (with classification heads and LoRA) plus LLMs, against supervised TimeSFormer on a simulated 13.26-hour video dataset.

Result: Zero-shot local VLMs suffered from hallucinations; LoRA fine-tuned VLMs achieved F1=0.91 versus TimeSFormer F1=0.70.

Conclusion: Fine-tuned local VLMs with LoRA can substantially improve newborn resuscitation activity recognition, outperforming a TimeSFormer baseline.

Abstract: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is essential for quality improvement and adherence to clinical guidelines, yet remains underutilized in practice. Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70.

Motivation: 目标是利用外部表征的几何和语义对应特性，克服传统扩散基新视角合成在几何一致性和来自稀疏/无位姿数据的稳健性不足的问题。

Method: 论文首先分析外部视觉表征在空间注意力中自发出现的对应（correspondence）能力，随后设计了表示投影模块（representation projection modules），用于将外部表征按几何对应关系投影并注入扩散模型的不同阶段，从而引导生成过程。方法名为ReNoV（representation-guided novel view synthesis）。

Result: 在标准基准上，ReNoV在重建精度和修复质量（inpainting）方面显著优于之前的扩散基方法，并能够在稀疏且未标定位姿的图像集合上实现稳健的新视角合成。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的新视角合成框架ReNoV，通过将外部视觉表征（如特征图）作为条件注入扩散过程，实现几何与语义一致性的提升。实验表明在重建精度与图像修复质量上均优于现有基于扩散的方法，并能在稀疏且无位姿标定的图像集合上稳健工作。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for diffusion-based novel view synthesis in which we leverage external representations as conditions, harnessing their geometric and semantic correspondence properties for enhanced geometric consistency in generated novel viewpoints. First, we provide a detailed analysis exploring the correspondence capabilities emergent in the spatial attention of external visual representations. Building from these insights, we propose a representation-guided novel view synthesis through dedicated representation projection modules that inject external representations into the diffusion process, a methodology named ReNoV, short for representation-guided novel view synthesis. Our experiments show that this design yields marked improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and inpainting quality, outperforming prior diffusion-based novel-view methods on standard benchmarks and enabling robust synthesis from sparse, unposed image collections.

Conclusion: 该文提出的基于DMD的HDR成像系统能在强眩光条件下显著提升图像动态范围并减少DIC测量误差，为光学测量和应力分析提供可行方案。

Abstract: Background The accuracy of photomechanics measurements critically relies on image quality,particularly under extreme illumination conditions such as welding arc monitoring and polished metallic surface analysis. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging above 120 dB is essential in these contexts. Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors, with dynamic ranges typically below 70 dB, are highly susceptible to saturation under glare, resulting in irreversible loss of detail and significant errors in digital image correlation (DIC). Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate.

Motivation: 现有直接从观测预测多步动作的VLA模型受限于场景理解与未来预测能力；而大规模视频预训练的世界模型具备更强的时空推理与未来预测能力，可作为改进VLA学习的自然基础。

Method: 在GigaBrain-0.5的基础上，使用RAMP（基于世界模型条件化策略的强化学习）进行微调：首先利用视频世界模型的时空预测能力建模未来轨迹，然后基于该世界模型进行策略学习与想象（imagination）训练，从而改进多步动作块的决策。

Result: 在多个复杂操作任务（如Laundry Folding、Box Packing、Espresso Preparation）上，相较于RECAP基线，RAMP带来约30%的性能提升；GigaBrain-0.5M*在长时序执行上表现可靠，真实世界部署视频显示能持续完成复杂操作。

Conclusion: 本文提出了将视频世界模型与VLA（视觉-语言-动作）模型结合的方案，通过在预训练机器人数据基础上引入基于世界模型的强化学习（RAMP），显著提升了跨任务适应与长时序执行能力。实验显示在若干困难任务上相较基线提升约30%，并在真实世界部署中表现稳定。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models that directly predict multi-step action chunks from current observations face inherent limitations due to constrained scene understanding and weak future anticipation capabilities. In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*}, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Built upon \textit{GigaBrain-0.5}, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*} further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via \textit{RAMP} (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that \textit{RAMP} achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\% on challenging tasks including \texttt{Laundry Folding}, \texttt{Box Packing}, and \texttt{Espresso Preparation}. Critically, \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M$^*$} exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our \href{https://gigabrain05m.github.io}{project page}.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PosterOmni通过数据构建、跨专家蒸馏和统一的奖励对齐，成功将实体保持的局部编辑与概念驱动的全局创作整合到单一模型，显著提升图像到海报生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像到海报生成既需要保留图像中具体实体（如人物、物品）的视觉特征，也需要理解并生成高层次的设计概念（如布局、风格、文字），因此需要同时兼顾局部编辑和全局创作能力的模型。

Method: 提出了一个高效的数据-蒸馏-奖励管线：构建覆盖六种任务类型的多场景图像到海报数据集；在局部和全局专家间蒸馏知识进行有监督微调；引入统一的PosterOmni奖励反馈以联合对齐实体保持和审美偏好。

Result: 在PosterOmni-Bench上进行的大量实验表明，PosterOmni在参考遵循性、全局构图质量和审美元素一致性上显著优于所有开源基线，并超越若干专有系统。

Conclusion: PosterOmni是一个面向图像到海报生成的通用框架，通过整合局部编辑与全局创作两个范式，利用数据蒸馏与奖励反馈的方法，提升了在实体保持、布局构图和审美一致性方面的表现。

Abstract: Image-to-poster generation is a high-demand task requiring not only local adjustments but also high-level design understanding. Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.

### [66] [FAIL: Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12155)
*Yeyao Ma,Chen Li,Xiaosong Zhang,Han Hu,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FAIL：一种在流匹配模型上进行对抗性模仿的后训练框架，提出FAIL-PD与FAIL-PG两种算法，无需奖励或偏好对即可有效对齐生成分布，实验证明在文生与图像/视频生成以及防止reward hacking方面效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的监督微调只能复制示范但无法在未见状态纠正策略漂移；偏好优化能修正但成本高（需要偏好对或奖励建模）。因此希望在不依赖偏好/奖励的情况下，通过对抗性训练直接缩小策略与专家的分布差异。

Method: 在理论上证明：对流匹配模型进行后训练（使输出分布与高质量目标一致）等价于模仿学习；基于此推导两种算法——FAIL-PD（利用可微分ODE求解器，获得低方差路径梯度）与FAIL-PG（黑箱策略梯度，适用于离散或受限场景）。训练采用对抗性判别器来最小化策略与专家的发散。

Result: 在Nano Banana pro数据集（1.3万示范）上微调FLUX，FAIL在提示遵从性和美学基准上表现竞争力；方法也可推广到离散图像和视频生成，并作为正则器减少基于奖励的优化中的reward hacking。代码与数据已开源。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了FAIL方法，通过对抗性模仿学习在流匹配生成模型上进行后训练，实现无奖励、无偏好对的专家-策略分布对齐，从而提升生成质量并抑制奖励黑客行为。

Abstract: Post-training of flow matching models-aligning the output distribution with a high-quality target-is mathematically equivalent to imitation learning. While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. Furthermore, the framework generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation, and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/HansPolo113/FAIL.

TL;DR: TexSpot 用 Texlet 表示结合 2D/3D 编码器与级联解码器，并用条件扩散 Transformer 对多视图生成纹理进行增强，解决视角不一致和高分辨率限制，显著提升 3D 纹理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视图扩散生成的 3D 纹理存在视角不一致性；UV 展开会引入失真，点基方法受几何密度限制难以生成高分辨率纹理，需新的表示与增强方法。

Method: 设计 Texlet：每个 Texlet 用 2D 编码器编码局部纹理 patch，再用 3D 编码器聚合形状上下文；采用级联 3D->2D 解码器重建高质量纹理 patch；在 Texlet 空间上训练条件扩散 Transformer 对多视图扩散输出进行增强。

Result: 大规模实验显示 TexSpot 在视觉保真度、几何一致性与鲁棒性上均优于现有最先进的 3D 纹理生成与增强方法。

Conclusion: TexSpot 提出了一种新的 3D 纹理增强框架，通过 Texlet 表示结合点基与 UV 优势，利用扩散 transformer 对多视图生成纹理进行细化，显著提高纹理质量与几何一致性。

Abstract: High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将R2AV、RV2AV、RA2V视为独立任务，且难以在单一框架内实现对多身份与音色的精确解耦与控制，导致多人物场景中出现身份-音色绑定失败与说话人混淆。

Method: 设计Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer用于融合异构条件信号；提出Dual-Level Disentanglement，包括信号层的Synchronized RoPE和语义层的Structured Captions；采用Multi-Task Progressive Training利用弱约束生成先验正则强约束任务。

Result: 在视频质量、音频质量及音视频一致性等多项指标上，DreamID-Omni实现了全面的SOTA性能，甚至优于商业闭源模型，并计划开源代码。

Conclusion: DreamID-Omni提出了一个统一的可控人类中心音视频生成框架，通过对称条件扩散变换器、双层解缠策略和多任务渐进训练实现对多人物体身份与音色的精确解耦控制，并在各项指标上取得了先进性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EO-VAE用动态超网络实现跨传感器、可变波段的单模型VAE tokenizer，在TerraMesh上重建优于TerraMind，适合作为遥感生成模型的基础tokenizer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型依赖tokenizer压缩高维输入，但遥感数据传感器多样、光谱通道可变，训练单独tokenizer不高效且难以扩展，需统一的多传感器tokenizer。

Method: 提出一个多传感器变分自编码器（EO-VAE），利用动态超网络根据输入光谱通道动态调整编码器/解码器参数，实现对灵活通道组合的编码与重建。

Result: 在TerraMesh数据集上的实验表明，EO-VAE在重建质量上优于TerraMind的tokenizers，为遥感领域的潜在生成建模建立了强基线。

Conclusion: EO-VAE通过单一模型和动态超网络实现多传感器多波段的统一编码与重建，显著提高了EO数据的重建保真度。

Abstract: State-of-the-art generative image and video models rely heavily on tokenizers that compress high-dimensional inputs into more efficient latent representations. While this paradigm has revolutionized RGB generation, Earth observation (EO) data presents unique challenges due to diverse sensor specifications and variable spectral channels. We propose EO-VAE, a multi-sensor variational autoencoder designed to serve as a foundational tokenizer for the EO domain. Unlike prior approaches that train separate tokenizers for each modality, EO-VAE utilizes a single model to encode and reconstruct flexible channel combinations via dynamic hypernetworks. Our experiments on the TerraMesh dataset demonstrate that EO-VAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to the TerraMind tokenizers, establishing a robust baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing.

TL;DR: 作者提出了一个 5B 参数的统一多模态生成模型 DeepGen 1.0，借助 SCB 对齐框架与三阶段训练策略，在少量数据和小参数下实现了超越更大模型的图像生成与编辑效果，并开源了全部资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态生成模型参数规模巨大，训练与部署成本高；目标是构建轻量（5B）但能力全面的统一生成与编辑模型。

Method: 提出了 Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB) 框架，从多个视觉语言模型层提取分层特征，并使用可学习的“思考 token”与生成骨干（DiT）融合；采用三阶段训练：对齐预训练、联合监督微调和带 MR-GRPO 的强化学习。

Result: 在仅约50M样本上训练，DeepGen 1.0 在多个基准上领先：在 WISE 上比 80B HunyuanImage 高 28%，在 UniREditBench 上比 27B Qwen-Image-Edit 高 37%。并提供代码、权重与数据集开源。

Conclusion: DeepGen 1.0 在保持参数量较小（5B）的前提下，通过结构性对齐和分阶段数据驱动训练策略，实现了与大模型相当甚至更好的图像生成与编辑能力。

Abstract: Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

Motivation: 解决多模态任务中理解与生成目标冲突、表示纠缠与可控性差的问题，同时希望实现强零样本泛化而无需大规模重训练。

Method: 提出统一离散流-匹配框架，使用任务特定低秩适配器分别处理理解与生成，且通过参考式偏好对齐优化相对结果；整体框架兼容多模态输入与离散表示。

Result: 在八个基准上达到了SOTA，并在多种任务上表现出强零样本泛化能力（图片修复、上下文生成、参考编辑、组合生成），即便未做任务特定训练。

Conclusion: UniDFlow通过将理解与生成解耦、引入任务特定低秩适配器，以及基于参考的多模态偏好对齐，在不大规模重训的情况下实现了更好的可控性与真实性。

Abstract: We propose UniDFlow, a unified discrete flow-matching framework for multimodal understanding, generation, and editing. It decouples understanding and generation via task-specific low-rank adapters, avoiding objective interference and representation entanglement, while a novel reference-based multimodal preference alignment optimizes relative outcomes under identical conditioning, improving faithfulness and controllability without large-scale retraining. UniDFlpw achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to tasks including inpainting, in-context image generation, reference-based editing, and compositional generation, despite no explicit task-specific training.

*Krish Agarwal,Zhuoming Chen,Cheng Luo,Yongqi Chen,Haizhong Zheng,Xun Huang,Atri Rudra,Beidi Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 Monarch-RT，一种基于 Monarch 矩阵的结构化注意力参数化，专为实时自回归视频扩散设计，兼顾表达力与效率，实验证明在高稀疏下无质量损失，并实现了单卡 16 FPS 的真实实时生成与显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在实时、少步、自回归视频扩散设定下，3D 自注意力的二次复杂度成为瓶颈，而先前为双向、多步扩散设计的稀疏注意力近似在该设定下失效，因视频注意力同时包含周期性位置结构与动态语义对齐与密集混合，超出简单稀疏策略的表达能力。需要一种既高效又有足够表示力的注意力参数化来实现实时视频生成。

Method: 作者观察到视频注意力既有由时空位置驱动的周期性结构，又有动态稀疏语义对应和密集混合，且传统稀疏近似（如 top-k）无法覆盖这些混合结构。基于此，提出 Monarch-RT：用 Monarch 矩阵对注意力进行因式分解，设计对齐的块结构与扩展的 tiled Monarch 参数化以兼顾表达与效率；通过微调减少参数化开销，并实现定制 Triton 内核以加速。评估包括与现有稀疏基线比较、在 Self-Forcing 模型中验证 95% 稀疏且不降质，以及与 FlashAttention-2/3/4 在不同 GPU 上比速。

Result: Monarch-RT 达到高达 95% 的注意力稀疏率且不损失生成质量，在 Self-Forcing 模型中实现真实实时（16 FPS）视频生成于单张 RTX 5090；在多种 GPU（RTX 5090, H100, B200）上，其自定义内核较 FlashAttention-2/3/4 分别实现约 1.4–11.8× 的核速度提升，且在与现有稀疏基线比较中表现更优。

Conclusion: Monarch-RT 提出了一种用于实时视频扩散生成的结构化注意力参数化方法，通过 Monarch 矩阵分解注意力，结合块结构和扩展平铺参数化，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升表达能力，从而在自回归、少步扩散设置下实现高稀疏性（高达95%）且不损失质量。实现上通过微调和自定义 Triton 内核克服了参数化开销，并在多款 GPU 上优于现有 FlashAttention 内核，推动了在单卡 RTX 5090 上 16 FPS 的实时视频生成。

Abstract: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.

TL;DR: UniT 通过训练与测试时的多回合链式思维，使单一多模态模型可迭代分解、验证并修正输出，显著改进复杂视觉-语言任务的生成与理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型通常仅单次前向完成任务，缺少迭代分解指令、验证中间结果与逐步修正的能力，而许多复杂多物体或演化指令的任务需要迭代推理。将语言模型测试时扩展计算的 TTS 思路引入多模态统一模型尚未解决。

Method: 结合（1）代理式数据合成生成多回合推理和编辑轨迹；（2）用统一模型进行训练以学习分解子目标、验证中间结果与记忆内容；（3）在测试时采用灵活的推理策略（顺序链式思维优于并行采样）实现额外推理计算分配。

Result: 关键发现：1) 在短推理轨迹上训练的统一模型能在测试时推广到更长的推理链；2) 顺序链式思维作为 TTS，比并行采样更可扩展且计算高效；3) 在生成与编辑轨迹上训练能提升分布外视觉推理性能。

Conclusion: 提出 UniT 框架，使统一多模态模型在测试时通过链式思维迭代推理、验证与修正，从而提升复杂视觉推理与生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展传统基于空间操作的视觉错觉（如多视图一致性）到时间维度，即通过逐步添加笔画使草图在不同时间点被识别为不同语义对象。

Method: 提出序列感知的联合优化框架，采用双分支Score Distillation Sampling(SDS)驱动，同时动态调整前缀笔画以发现对两个目标均有效的“共同结构子空间”，并引入Overlay Loss以保证空间互补性并避免遮挡。

Result: 实验表明该方法在可识别性和错觉强度上显著优于现有基线，成功将视觉谜题从空间扩展到时间维度。

Conclusion: 本论文提出了Progressive Semantic Illusions任务及对应的生成框架Stroke of Surprise，能通过序列化笔画在不同阶段呈现不同语义对象，实现时间维度的视觉谜题扩展。

Abstract: Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the "dual-constraint": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a "common structural subspace" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications increasingly rely on Filtered Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (FANNS) to combine semantic retrieval with metadata constraints. While algorithmic innovations for FANNS have been proposed, there remains a lack of understanding regarding how generic filtering strategies perform within Vector Databases. In this work, we systematize the taxonomy of filtering strategies and evaluate their integration into FAISS, Milvus, and pgvector. To provide a robust benchmarking framework, we introduce a new relational dataset, \textit{MoReVec}, consisting of two tables, featuring 768-dimensional text embeddings and a rich schema of metadata attributes. We further propose the \textit{Global-Local Selectivity (GLS)} correlation metric to quantify the relationship between filters and query vectors.
  Our experiments reveal that algorithmic adaptations within the engine often override raw index performance. Specifically, we find that: (1) \textit{Milvus} achieves superior recall stability through hybrid approximate/exact execution; (2) \textit{pgvector}'s cost-based query optimizer frequently selects suboptimal execution plans, favoring approximate index scans even when exact sequential scans would yield perfect recall at comparable latency; and (3) partition-based indexes (IVFFlat) outperform graph-based indexes (HNSW) for low-selectivity queries. To facilitate this analysis, we extend the widely-used \textit{ANN-Benchmarks} to support filtered vector search and make it available online. Finally, we synthesize our findings into a set of practical guidelines for selecting index types and configuring query optimizers for hybrid search workloads.

TL;DR: FastPGT通过并行构建多个近邻图并一次性推荐多组参数，显著降低PG参数调优的计算开销，实验显示可在不降低质量的情况下实现最高2.37x加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近邻图构建参数对k-ANNS性能影响显著，但PG构建复杂度为超线性，使得为每组参数单独构建图并测试的调优代价极高；现有方法未专门优化此过程。

Method: 通过同时并行构建多个近邻图以复用计算，减少重复工作；并修改现有的调优模型，使其一次推荐多个候选参数，从而配合并行构建策略高效估计多组参数的性能。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上进行实证，FastPGT在保持调优质量的同时，相较于VDTuner加速最高可达2.37倍。

Conclusion: 本文提出FastPGT框架，有效加速了近邻图（PG）构建参数的调优过程，在不损失调优质量的前提下对比VDTuner可达2.37倍的加速。

Abstract: k-approximate nearest neighbor search (k-ANNS) in high-dimensional vector spaces is a fundamental problem across many fields. With the advent of vector databases and retrieval-augmented generation, k-ANNS has garnered increasing attention. Among existing methods, proximity graphs (PG) based approaches are the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. However, the construction parameters of PGs significantly impact their search performance. Before constructing a PG for a given dataset, it is essential to tune these parameters, which first recommends a set of promising parameters and then estimates the quality of each parameter by building the corresponding PG and then testing its k-ANNS performance. Given that the construction complexity of PGs is superlinear, building and evaluating graph indexes accounts for the primary cost of parameter tuning. Unfortunately, there is currently no method considered and optimized this process.In this paper, we introduce FastPGT, an efficient framework for tuning the PG construction parameters. FastPGT accelerates parameter estimation by building multiple PGs simultaneously, thereby reducing repeated computations. Moreover, we modify the SOTA tuning model to recommend multiple parameters at once, which can be efficiently estimated using our method of building multiple PGs simultaneously. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that FastPGT achieves up to 2.37x speedup over the SOTA method VDTuner, without compromising tuning quality.

### [77] [Towards a theory of Façade-X data access: satisfiability of SPARQL basic graph patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11756)
*Luigi Asprino,Enrico Daga*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 本文形式化并巩固了Façade-X，解决了在其上判断SPARQL基本图模式可满足性的问题，提出算法并通过原型实现和实验证明可行，有助于提升异构数据源的知识图谱集成与查询效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱主要用于数据集成，但底层数据通常为CSV、XML、关系型等非图格式。Façade-X旨在提供一种能直接访问各种数据格式的方式，使得SPARQL可以对这些结构化数据源查询。

Method: 扩展并形式化Façade-X的元模型，分析其仅使用RDF子集导致部分SPARQL查询不可满足，提出针对BGP的可满足性判定算法，并实现原型在真实查询和数据上做大规模实验。

Result: 给出BGP可满足性的理论分析与判定算法，提供了证明概念的实现（SPARQL Anything）和大量实验，验证算法在实际数据和查询上的可行性。

Conclusion: 作者将Façade-X理论化并研究了在Façade-X上基本图模式(BGP)的可满足性，提出了判定算法并提供了原型实现与实验，证明方法可行。

Abstract: Data integration is the primary use case for knowledge graphs. However, integrated data are not typically graphs but come in different formats, for example, CSV, XML, or a relational database. Façade-X is a recently proposed method for providing direct access to an open-ended set of data formats. The method includes a meta-model that specialises RDF to fit general data structures. This model allows to express SPARQL queries targeting data sources with those structures. Previous work formalised Façade-X and demonstrated how it can theoretically represent any format expressible with a context-free grammar, as well as the relational model. A reference implementation, SPARQL Anything, demonstrates the feasibility of the approach in practice. It is noteworthy that Façade-X utilises a fraction of RDF, and, consequently, not all SPARQL queries yield a solution (i.e. are satisfiable) when evaluated over a Façade-X graph. In this article, we consolidate Façade-X, and we study the satisfiability of basic graph patterns. The theory is accompanied by an algorithm for deciding the satisfiability of basic graph patterns on Façade-X data sources. Furthermore, we provide extensive experiments with a proof-of-concept implementation, demonstrating practical feasibility, including with real-world queries. Our results pave the way for studying query execution strategies for Façade-X data access with SPARQL and supporting developers to build more efficient data integration systems for knowledge graphs.

TL;DR: 提出H3网格聚合的船舶轨迹插补框架HABIT，利用历史模式索引实现低延迟且精度可比的缺失段补全，适用于多种船型和数据条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIS数据存在大量轨迹间断（由覆盖缺失或设备故意关闭导致），传统车辆轨迹插补方法不能充分捕捉海上船舶独特的运动特征（如平滑转向、港口机动、受天气影响的航行），需要针对海域特性的高效插补方法。

Method: 利用H3六边形网格对AIS轨迹进行离散化，按船舶类型和运动特征聚合历史轨迹段，建立基于位置-运动模式的索引；在插补时检索相似网格内的历史模式并基于最匹配模式生成插补轨迹，框架可配置网格分辨率、时间窗口和相似性度量。

Result: 在不同时间范围、数据密度和船舶类型的实证分析中，HABIT在插补精度上与基线方法可比，但在延迟（计算效率）上表现更优，且能够结合船舶特性与运动模式提供更适应性的插补。

Conclusion: 本文提出了HABIT，一种基于H3网格聚合的轻量可配置船舶轨迹缺失插补框架，能够从历史AIS数据中提取并索引航行模式，用于补全轨迹缺失段。

Abstract: Modeling vessel activity at sea is critical for a wide range of applications, including route planning, transportation logistics, maritime safety, and environmental monitoring. Over the past two decades, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) has enabled real-time monitoring of hundreds of thousands of vessels, generating huge amounts of data daily. One major challenge in using AIS data is the presence of large gaps in vessel trajectories, often caused by coverage limitations or intentional transmission interruptions. These gaps can significantly degrade data quality, resulting in inaccurate or incomplete analysis. State-of-the-art imputation approaches have mainly been devised to tackle gaps in vehicle trajectories, even when the underlying road network is not considered. But the motion patterns of sailing vessels differ substantially, e.g., smooth turns, maneuvering near ports, or navigating in adverse weather conditions. In this application paper, we propose HABIT, a lightweight, configurable H3 Aggregation-Based Imputation framework for vessel Trajectories. This data-driven framework provides a valuable means to impute missing trajectory segments by extracting, analyzing, and indexing motion patterns from historical AIS data. Our empirical study over AIS data across various timeframes, densities, and vessel types reveals that HABIT produces maritime trajectory imputations performing comparably to baseline methods in terms of accuracy, while performing better in terms of latency while accounting for vessel characteristics and their motion patterns.

### [79] [Designing and Comparing RPQ Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11949)
*Victor Marsault,Antoine Meyer*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: 作者提出并形式化了用于比较RPQ语义的理论框架，证明了若干性质的矛盾与限制，并给出新语义示例，为图查询语言语义设计提供理论参考。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图数据库查询语言在明确输出游走时脱离了传统同态语义，导致可能匹配无限多条游走，因此需要实用的规则来选出有限子集，但现有语言采用了各自的经验性标准，缺乏系统化比较与指导。

Method: 构建将数据库和查询映射到有限游走集合的语义框架；形式化若干语义性质；证明性质之间的相容性和不可达性；提供若干新定义的RPQ语义作为示例。

Result: 给出了多个形式化性质、若干不可兼容性/不可满足性的证明、以及一些新的RPQ语义示例，这些结果有助于理解和设计更合理的查询语义。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个用于分类和比较基于RPQ的语义的框架，通过形式化若干性质并证明它们之间的相互关系，表明某些性质彼此排斥或无法同时满足，从而为选择和设计查询语义提供理论依据。

Abstract: Modern property graph database query languages such as Cypher, PGQL, GSQL, and the standard GQL draw inspiration from the formalism of regular path queries (RPQs). In order to output walks explicitly, they depart from the classical and well-studied homomorphism semantics. However, it then becomes difficult to present results to users because RPQs may match infinitely many walks. The aforementioned languages use ad-hoc criteria to select a finite subset of those matches. For instance, Cypher uses trail semantics, discarding walks with repeated edges; PGQL and GSQL use shortest walk semantics, retaining only the walks of minimal length among all matched walks; and GQL allows users to choose from several semantics. Even though there is academic research on these semantics, it focuses almost exclusively on evaluation efficiency.
  In an attempt to better understand, choose and design RPQ semantics, we present a framework to categorize and compare them according to other criteria. We formalize several possible properties, pertaining to the study of RPQ semantics seen as mathematical functions mapping a database and a query to a finite set of walks. We show that some properties are mutually exclusive, or cannot be met. We also give several new RPQ semantics as examples. Some of them may provide ideas for the design of new semantics for future graph database query languages.

TL;DR: DIVER通过工具驱动的多轮动态探查和CoTF反思机制，自动找回缺失的schema与value链接，显著提升无专家证据场景下Text-to-SQL的鲁棒性与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOTA Text-to-SQL模型依赖专家书写的证据以解决schema和value匹配问题，但在真实、动态的大规模数据库值面前易失效，执行准确率大幅下降，缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 构建可兼容的工具箱用于探查数据库，使用受限结构化工作空间（CoTF: Chain of Thoughts and Facts）进行反思与决策，基于多轮探查自动识别遗漏的schema和value链接，进而推断SQL函数与公式并生成高质量证据。

Result: 在大量实验中，DIVER能显著提升多种Text-to-SQL模型的鲁棒性，Execution Accuracy提升最多10.82%，Valid Efficiency Score提升最多16.09%；动态交互值链接显著提高schema/value链接准确率。

Conclusion: 本文提出DIVER系统，通过自动化证据推理与动态交互式值链接，提高Text-to-SQL在无专家证据场景下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the era of large language models, Text-to-SQL, as a natural language interface for databases, is playing an increasingly important role. The sota Text-to-SQL models have achieved impressive accuracy, but their performance critically relies on expert-written evidence, which typically clarifies schema and value linking that existing models struggle to identify. Such limitations stem from the ambiguity of user queries and, more importantly, the complexity of comprehending large-scale and dynamic database values. Consequently, in real-world scenarios where expert assistance is unavailable, existing methods suffer a severe performance collapse, with execution accuracy dropping by over 10%. This underscores their lack of robustness. To address this, we propose DIVER, a robust system that automates evidence reasoning with dynamic interactive value linking. It leverages a compatible toolbox containing diverse tools to probe the database. Then, restricted by a structured workspace (CoTF, Chain of Thoughts and Facts), it reflects based on probe results and selects a new tool for next round of probing. Through this automatically iterative process, DIVER identifies schema and value linking missed by existing methods. Based on these accurate linkings, DIVER is able to infer correct usage of SQL functions and formulas and generate high-quality evidence, achieving robust Text-to-SQL without expert assistance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: 1) The DIVER system significantly enhances the robustness of various Text-to-SQL models, improving performance by up to 10.82% in Execution Accuracy (EX) and 16.09% in Valid Efficiency Score (VES). 2) Our dynamic interactive value linking significantly improves the robustness of existing systems and the accuracy of schema and value linking, especially when confronted with challenges posed by large-scale, dynamic database values.
