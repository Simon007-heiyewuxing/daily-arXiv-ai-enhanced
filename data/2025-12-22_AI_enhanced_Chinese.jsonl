These demands restrict development to a small number of highly specialized engineers. This thesis aims to democratize cloud application development by addressing three challenges: programmability, high-performance fault-tolerant serializable transactions, and serverless semantics.\n  The thesis identifies strong parallels between cloud applications and the streaming dataflow execution model. It first explores this connection through T-Statefun, a transactional extension of Apache Flink Statefun, demonstrating that dataflow systems can support transactional cloud applications via a stateful functions-as-a-service API. However, this approach revealed significant limitations in programmability and performance.\n  To overcome these issues, the thesis introduces Stateflow, a high-level object-oriented programming model that compiles applications into stateful dataflow graphs with minimal boilerplate. Building on this model, the thesis presents Styx, a distributed streaming dataflow engine that provides deterministic, multi-partition, serializable transactions with strong fault tolerance guarantees. Styx eliminates explicit transaction failure handling and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems.\n  Finally, the thesis extends Styx with transactional state migration to support elasticity under dynamic workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7b80\u5316\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86T-Statefun\u3001Stateflow\u4e0e\u6d41\u5f0f\u5f15\u64ceStyx\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Styx\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e8b\u52a1\u3001\u9ad8\u5bb9\u9519\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8de8\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u591a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u957f\uff1b\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u964d\u4f4e\u95e8\u69db\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e8b\u52a1\u4e0e\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6267\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6784\u5efaT-Statefun\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eFlink Statefun\u7684\u4e8b\u52a1\u6269\u5c55\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63d0\u51faStateflow\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u7f16\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u5e94\u7528\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u56fe\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0Styx\u6d41\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u591a\u5206\u533a\u53ef\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e8b\u52a1\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5bb9\u9519\uff1b\u5e76\u5728Styx\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8b\u52a1\u6027\u72b6\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f39\u6027\u3002", "result": "T-Statefun\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u652f\u6301\u4e8b\u52a1\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff1bStateflow\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6837\u677f\u4ee3\u7801\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\uff1bStyx\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u514d\u9664\u663e\u5f0f\u4e8b\u52a1\u5931\u8d25\u5904\u7406\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u6545\u969c\u5bb9\u5fcd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9762\u5411\u5bf9\u8c61\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u628a\u53ef\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e8b\u52a1\u4e0e\u5f39\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u5e26\u5165\u65e0\u670d\u52a1\u5668/\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u53d1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u7f16\u7a0b\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e91\u5e94\u7528\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u3002"}}

We introduce the Adaptive Visual Model (AVM), a structure-preserving framework that enables condition-aware adaptation through modular subnetworks, without modifying the core representation. AVM keeps a Vision Transformer-based encoder frozen to capture consistent visual features, while independently trained modulation paths account for neural response variations driven by stimulus content and subject identity. We evaluate AVM in three experimental settings, including stimulus-level variation, cross-subject generalization, and cross-dataset adaptation, all of which involve structured changes in inputs and individuals. Across two large-scale mouse V1 datasets, AVM outperforms the state-of-the-art V1T model by approximately 2% in predictive correlation, demonstrating robust generalization, interpretable condition-wise modulation, and high architectural efficiency. Specifically, AVM achieves a 9.1% improvement in explained variance (FEVE) under the cross-dataset adaptation setting. These results suggest that AVM provides a unified framework for adaptive neural modeling across biological and experimental conditions, offering a scalable solution under structural constraints.

New sensors and classification approaches like TLS and deep learning achieve state-of-the art accuracy but their decision processes remain unclear. Methods such as Finer-CAM (Class Activation Mapping) can highlight features in TLS projections that contribute to the classification of a target species, yet are uncommon in similar looking contrastive tree species. We propose a novel method linking Finer-CAM explanations to segments of TLS projections representing structural tree features to systemically evaluate which features drive species discrimination. Using TLS data from 2,445 trees across seven European tree species, we trained and validated five YOLOv8 models with cross-validation, reaching a mean accuracy of 96% (SD = 0.24%). Analysis of 630 saliency maps shows the models primarily rely on crown features in TLS projections for species classification. While this result is pronounced in Silver Birch, European Beech, English oak, and Norway spruce, stem features contribute more frequently to the differentiation of European ash, Scots pine, and Douglas fir.

We introduce a method that approaches video generation in a filmmaker-like manner. Instead of creating a video in one step, our proposed pipeline first uses a large language model to generate a detailed production script. This script guides a text-to-image model in creating consistent visuals for each character, which then serve as anchors for a video generation model to synthesize each scene individually. Our baseline comparisons validate the necessity of this multi-stage decomposition; specifically, we observe that removing the visual anchoring mechanism results in a catastrophic drop in character consistency scores (from 7.99 to 0.55), confirming that visual priors are essential for identity preservation.

Yet, the inherent complexity and variable information density of videos present a significant bottleneck for current tokenizers, which rigidly compress all content at a fixed rate, leading to redundancy or information loss. Drawing inspiration from Shannon's information theory, this paper introduces InfoTok, a principled framework for adaptive video tokenization. We rigorously prove that existing data-agnostic training methods are suboptimal in representation length, and present a novel evidence lower bound (ELBO)-based algorithm that approaches theoretical optimality. Leveraging this framework, we develop a transformer-based adaptive compressor that enables adaptive tokenization. Empirical results demonstrate state-of-the-art compression performance, saving 20% tokens without influence on performance, and achieving 2.3x compression rates while still outperforming prior heuristic adaptive approaches. By allocating tokens according to informational richness, InfoTok enables a more compressed yet accurate tokenization for video representation, offering valuable insights for future research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faInfoTok\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eELBO\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u7528Transformer\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u663e\u8457\u8282\u7701\u4ee4\u724c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4e0d\u5747\u4e14\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5904\u7406\u5bf9token\u6570\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9700\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInfoTok\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8bc1\u660e\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u8868\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eELBO\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u4f18\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u538b\u7f29\u5668\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u914d\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u8282\u770120%\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u80fd\u8fbe\u52302.3\u500d\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u5e76\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6309\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u5206\u914d\u4ee4\u724c\u53ef\u5728\u66f4\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\u5316\u548c\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

EndoSemiS uses 4 strategies to improve performance by effectively utilizing all available data, particularly unlabeled data: (1) Cross-supervision between two individual networks that supervise each other; (2) Uncertainty-guided pseudo-labels from unlabeled data, which are generated by selecting high-confidence regions to improve their quality; (3) Joint pseudolabel supervision, which aggregates reliable pixels from the pseudo-labels of both networks to provide accurate supervision for unlabeled data; and (4) Mutual learning, where both networks learn from each other at the feature and image levels, reducing variance and guiding them toward a consistent solution. Additionally, a separate corrective network that utilizes spatiotemporal information from endoscopy video to improve segmentation performance.

Yet, existing satellite-based disturbance products remain too coarse to detect changes at the scale of individual trees, typically below 100 m$^{2}$. Here, we introduce FORMSpoT (Forest Mapping with SPOT Time series), a decade-long (2014-2024) nationwide mapping of forest canopy height at 1.5 m resolution, together with annual disturbance polygons (FORMSpoT-$\u0394$) covering mainland France. Canopy heights were derived from annual SPOT-6/7 composites using a hierarchical transformer model (PVTv2) trained on high-resolution airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. To enable robust change detection across heterogeneous acquisitions, we developed a dedicated post-processing pipeline combining co-registration and spatio-temporal total variation denoising. Validation against ALS revisits across 19 sites and 5,087 National Forest Inventory plots shows that FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ substantially outperforms existing disturbance products. In mountainous forests, where disturbances are small and spatially fragmented, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ achieves an F1-score of 0.44, representing an order of magnitude higher than existing benchmarks. By enabling tree-level monitoring of forest dynamics at national scale, FORMSpoT-$\u0394$ provides a unique tool to analyze management practices, detect early signals of forest decline, and better quantify carbon losses from subtle disturbances such as thinning or selective logging.

A key challenge in camera-controlled video generation is ensuring fidelity to the specified camera pose, while maintaining view consistency and reasoning about occluded geometry from limited observations. To address this, existing methods either train trajectory-conditioned video generation model on trajectory-video pair dataset, or estimate depth from the input video to reproject it along a target trajectory and generate the unprojected regions. Nevertheless, existing methods struggle to generate camera-pose-faithful, high-quality videos for two main reasons: (1) reprojection-based approaches are highly susceptible to errors caused by inaccurate depth estimation; and (2) the limited diversity of camera trajectories in existing datasets restricts learned models. To address these limitations, we present InfCam, a depth-free, camera-controlled video-to-video generation framework with high pose fidelity. The framework integrates two key components: (1) infinite homography warping, which encodes 3D camera rotations directly within the 2D latent space of a video diffusion model. Conditioning on this noise-free rotational information, the residual parallax term is predicted through end-to-end training to achieve high camera-pose fidelity; and (2) a data augmentation pipeline that transforms existing synthetic multiview datasets into sequences with diverse trajectories and focal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that InfCam outperforms baseline methods in camera-pose accuracy and visual fidelity, generalizing well from synthetic to real-world data.

Despite the significant progress in this field, there is still a largely unanswered research question: \"How can we quantitatively assess the similarity of a synthetically generated set of images with a set of real images in a given application domain?\". Today, answers to this question are mainly provided via user evaluation studies, inception-based measures, and the classification performance achieved on synthetic images. This paper proposes a novel measure to assess the similarity between synthetically generated and real sets of images, in terms of their utility for the development of DL-based CDS systems. Inspired by generalized neural additive models, and unlike inception-based measures, the proposed measure is interpretable (Interpretable Utility Similarity, IUS), explaining why a synthetic dataset could be more useful than another one in the context of a CDS system based on clinically relevant image features. The experimental results on publicly available datasets from various color medical imaging modalities including endoscopic, dermoscopic and fundus imaging, indicate that selecting synthetic images of high utility similarity using IUS can result in relative improvements of up to 54.6% in terms of classification performance. The generality of IUS for synthetic data assessment is demonstrated also for greyscale X-ray and ultrasound imaging modalities.

Project page: https://junyingw.github.io/paper/dgh", "summary": "The creation of photorealistic dynamic hair remains a major challenge in digital human modeling because of the complex motions, occlusions, and light scattering. Existing methods often resort to static capture and physics-based models that do not scale as they require manual parameter fine-tuning to handle the diversity of hairstyles and motions, and heavy computation to obtain high-quality appearance. In this paper, we present Dynamic Gaussian Hair (DGH), a novel framework that efficiently learns hair dynamics and appearance. We propose: (1) a coarse-to-fine model that learns temporally coherent hair motion dynamics across diverse hairstyles; (2) a strand-guided optimization module that learns a dynamic 3D Gaussian representation for hair appearance with support for differentiable rendering, enabling gradient-based learning of view-consistent appearance under motion. Unlike prior simulation-based pipelines, our approach is fully data-driven, scales with training data, and generalizes across various hairstyles and head motion sequences. Additionally, DGH can be seamlessly integrated into a 3D Gaussian avatar framework, enabling realistic, animatable hair for high-fidelity avatar representation. DGH achieves promising geometry and appearance results, providing a scalable, data-driven alternative to physics-based simulation and rendering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDynamic Gaussian Hair\uff08DGH\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u52a8\u60013D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5934\u53d1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5934\u53d1\u5efa\u6a21\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6355\u6349\u6216\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u53c2\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u53d1\u578b\u4e0e\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5934\u53d1\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4e0e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5916\u89c2\u3002", "method": "1) \u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u5404\u79cd\u53d1\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u4e1d\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b2) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53d1\u675f\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u60013D\u9ad8\u65af\u5916\u89c2\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u4ee5\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5916\u89c2\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3) \u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u96c6\u6210\u8fdb3D\u9ad8\u65af\u5934\u50cf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5934\u53d1\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "DGH\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5934\u53d1\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u4e1d\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u5fae\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u6e10\u8fdb\u7c97\u7ec6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "DGH\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u7ba1\u7ebf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u6837\u53d1\u578b\u4e0e\u5934\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5934\u53d1\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c6\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u52303D\u9ad8\u65af\u5934\u50cf\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002"}}

Our review shows that, while the literature has demonstrated transformer-based frame prediction for sonar sensing, no prior work addresses transformer-based maritime radar frame prediction, thereby defining a clear research gap and motivating a concrete research direction for future work in this area.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u6d77\u4e8b\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff1a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728AIS\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u58f0\u7eb3\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2dTransformer\u5df2\u88ab\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6d77\u4e8b\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5c1a\u65e0\u76f8\u5173\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u786e\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u4e8b\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u63d0\u524d\u9884\u5224\u8239\u8236\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u96f7\u8fbe\u7531\u4e8e\u5168\u5929\u5019\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u662f\u6d77\u4e0a\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u4f46\u9488\u5bf9\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e27\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u68b3\u7406\u6216\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u7f3a\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u8fdb\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff08AIS\u3001\u58f0\u7eb3\u3001\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e27\u7b49\uff09\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662fTransformer\u53ca\u5176\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u57df\uff08\u77ed\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\uff09\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\uff09\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u6d77\u4e8b\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u7efc\u8ff0\u53d1\u73b0\uff1aTransformer\u5728AIS\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u58f0\u7eb3\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6355\u6349\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u590d\u6742\u65f6\u7a7a\u5173\u7cfb\u65b9\u9762\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u516c\u5f00\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u672a\u89c1\u9488\u5bf9\u6d77\u4e8b\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e27\u7684Transformer\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u5c06\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e27\u4e0a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u7279\u6027\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u906e\u6321\u4e0e\u56de\u6ce2\u7279\u6027\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u6307\u51fa\u6d77\u4e8b\u96f7\u8fbe\u5e27\u7684Transformer-based\u9884\u6d4b\u5c1a\u5c5e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u672a\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u6d77\u4e8b\u96f7\u8fbe\u89c6\u9891/\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u96f7\u8fbe\u7279\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u7a7aTransformer\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u9891\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\uff09\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff08AIS/\u58f0\u7eb3/\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347\u6d77\u4e8b\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u5927\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

SDUM exhibits foundation-model-like scaling behavior: reconstruction quality follows PSNR ${\\sim}$ log(parameters) with correlation $r{=}0.986$ ($R^2{=}0.973$) up to 18 cascades, demonstrating predictable performance gains with model depth. A single SDUM trained on heterogeneous data achieves state-of-the-art results across all four CMRxRecon2025 challenge tracks--multi-center, multi-disease, 5T, and pediatric--without task-specific fine-tuning, surpassing specialized baselines by up to ${+}1.0$~dB.

This is unlike common photos people can take of themselves. In this paper, we explore how to create a ``professional'' version of a person's photograph, i.e., in a chosen pose, in a simple environment, with good lighting, and standard black top/bottom clothing. A key challenge is to preserve the person's unique identity, face and body features while transforming the photo. If there would exist a large paired dataset of the same person photographed both ``in the wild'' and by a professional photographer, the problem would potentially be easier to solve. However, such data does not exist, especially for a large variety of identities. To that end, we propose two key insights: 1) Our method transforms the input photo and person's face to a canonical UV space, which is further coupled with reposing methodology to model occlusions and novel view synthesis.

To ensure text regions remain readable, we employ a \\emph{latent masking} formulation that softly attenuates updates in the diffusion space, inspired by smooth barrier functions in physics and numerical optimization. In addition, we introduce \\emph{Automated Readability Optimization (ARO)}, which automatically places semi-transparent, rounded backing shapes behind text regions. ARO determines the minimal opacity needed to satisfy perceptual contrast standards (WCAG 2.2) relative to the underlying background, ensuring readability while maintaining aesthetic harmony without human intervention. Multi-page consistency is maintained through a summarization-and-instruction process, where each page is distilled into a compact representation that recursively guides subsequent generations. This design reflects how humans build continuity by retaining prior context, ensuring that visual motifs evolve coherently across an entire document. Our method further treats a document as a structured composition in which text, figures, and backgrounds are preserved or regenerated as separate layers, allowing targeted background editing without compromising readability. Finally, user-provided prompts allow stylistic adjustments in color and texture, balancing automated consistency with flexible customization. Our training-free framework produces visually coherent, text-preserving, and thematically aligned documents, bridging generative modeling with natural design workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u3001\u591a\u9875\u8fde\u7eed\u4e14\u4fdd\u62a4\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u7684\u6587\u6863\u80cc\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7528\u6269\u6563\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f6f\u63a9\u7801\u4fdd\u62a4\u6587\u672c\u3001ARO\u81ea\u52a8\u6dfb\u52a0\u534a\u900f\u660e\u5706\u89d2\u5e95\u8272\u6ee1\u8db3WCAG\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u9875\u901a\u8fc7\u6458\u8981\u9012\u5f52\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6587\u6863\u5206\u5c42\u4ee5\u4fbf\u6709\u9009\u62e9\u5730\u7f16\u8f91\u80cc\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6587\u6863\u80cc\u666f\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e38\u7834\u574f\u6587\u672c\u6216\u56fe\u50cf\u7b49\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u8de8\u591a\u9875\u6587\u6863\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e3b\u9898\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6587\u672c\u6e05\u6670\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9875\u4e3b\u9898\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u81ea\u7136\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u5236\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "method": "\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) Latent masking\uff1a\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8f6f\u8870\u51cf\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7075\u611f\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u6570\u503c\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u50cf\u7d20\u4e0d\u88ab\u7834\u574f\uff1b2) ARO\uff1a\u81ea\u52a8\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5411\u6587\u672c\u533a\u57df\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u534a\u900f\u660e\u5706\u89d2\u5e95\u8272\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u5bf9\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3WCAG 2.2\u611f\u77e5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\uff1b3) \u591a\u9875\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5df2\u751f\u6210\u9875\u9762\u63d0\u70bc\u4e3a\u7d27\u51d1\u6458\u8981/\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u9875\u9762\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u4f20\u9012\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4e3b\u9898\u5ef6\u7eed\uff1b4) \u5206\u5c42\u5904\u7406\uff1a\u628a\u6587\u6863\u5206\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5c42\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4fdd\u7559\u6216\u91cd\u5efa\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9a\u5411\u7f16\u8f91\uff1b5) \u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u8272\u5f69\u4e0e\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\uff1a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\uff08\u6ee1\u8db3WCAG\uff09\u3001\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u9875\u4e3b\u9898\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u7f8e\u89c2\u80cc\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53cb\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u4e0e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9762\u5411\u6587\u6863\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u591a\u9875\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4e3b\u9898\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u8d21\u732e\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8f6f\u63a9\u7801\uff08latent masking\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6587\u672c\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u53ef\u8bfb\u6027\u4f18\u5316\uff08ARO\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u900f\u660e\u5706\u89d2\u80cc\u666f\u6ee1\u8db3WCAG\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u6458\u8981\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u9012\u5f52\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9875\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6587\u6863\u89c6\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7f16\u8f91\u80cc\u666f\u800c\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u6587\u672c\u6216\u56fe\u5f62\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u8d2f\u3001\u6587\u672c\u53ef\u8bfb\u4e14\u4e3b\u9898\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u9875\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7528\u6237\u98ce\u683c\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}}

Infrared images and fire masks provide complementary thermal and boundary information, yet current methods are predominantly limited to binary mask modeling with inherent signal sparsity, failing to capture the complex dynamics of fire. While world models show promise in video generation, their physical inconsistencies pose significant challenges for fire forecasting. This paper introduces PhysFire-WM, a Physics-informed World Model for emulating Fire spread dynamics. Our approach internalizes combustion dynamics by encoding structured priors from a Physical Simulator to rectify physical discrepancies, coupled with a Cross-task Collaborative Training strategy (CC-Train) that alleviates the issue of limited information in mask-based modeling.

However, existing methods, including Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), all rely on annotated text-to-image pairs for aligning visual and textual modalities. This dependency introduces substantial cost and accuracy requirement in preparing high-quality datasets. At the same time, processing data from two modes also requires dual-tower encoders for most models, which also hinders their lightweight. To address these limitations, we introduce a ``Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training via Large-Language-Model-based Generation (LGCLIP)\" framework. LGCLIP leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate class-specific prompts that guide a diffusion model in synthesizing reference images. Afterwards these generated images serve as visual prototypes, and the visual features of real images are extracted and compared with the visual features of these prototypes to achieve comparative prediction. By optimizing prompt generation through the LLM and employing only a visual encoder, LGCLIP remains lightweight and efficient. Crucially, our framework requires only class labels as input during whole experimental procedure, eliminating the need for manually annotated image-text pairs and extra pre-processing.

In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches.

Evaluation can be broadly grouped into objective (e.g., measuring the amount of greenery) and subjective (e.g., polling the perception of people) approaches, which may differ -- what people see and feel about how green a place is might not match the measurements of the actual amount of vegetation. In this work, we advance the state of the art by measuring such differences and explaining them through human, geographic, and spatial dimensions. The experiments rely on contextual information extracted from street view imagery and a comprehensive urban visual perception survey collected from 1,000 people across five countries with their extensive demographic and personality information. We analyze the discrepancies between objective measures (e.g., Green View Index (GVI)) and subjective scores (e.g., pairwise ratings), examining whether they can be explained by a variety of human and visual factors such as age group and spatial variation of greenery in the scene. The findings reveal that such discrepancies are comparable around the world and that demographics and personality do not play a significant role in perception. Further, while perceived and measured greenery correlate consistently across geographies (both where people and where imagery are from), where people live plays a significant role in explaining perceptual differences, with these two, as the top among seven, features that influences perceived greenery the most.

The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": ""}}

However, their reliability is hindered by hallucinations, where models often fail to derive answers from visual evidence, instead relying on learned textual priors. Existing mitigation strategies for MedVLMs have distinct limitations: training-based methods rely on costly expert annotations, limiting scalability, while training-free interventions like contrastive decoding, though data-efficient, apply a global, untargeted correction whose effects in complex real-world clinical settings can be unreliable. To address these challenges, we introduce Anatomical Region-Guided Contrastive Decoding (ARCD), a plug-and-play strategy that mitigates hallucinations by providing targeted, region-specific guidance. Our module leverages an anatomical mask to direct a three-tiered contrastive decoding process. By dynamically re-weighting at the token, attention, and logits levels, it verifiably steers the model's focus onto specified regions, reinforcing anatomical understanding and suppressing factually incorrect outputs.

The development of the diffusion models (DM) and the end-to-end models (E2E model) has greatly improved the frontier of pansharping. DM takes the multi-step diffusion to obtain an accurate estimation of the residual between LRMSI and HRMSI. However, the multi-step process takes large computational power and is time-consuming. As for E2E models, their performance is still limited by the lack of prior and simple structure. In this paper, we propose a novel four-stage training strategy to obtain a lightweight network Fose, which fuses one-step DM and an E2E model. We perform one-step distillation on an enhanced SOTA DM for pansharping to compress the inference process from 50 steps to only 1 step. Then we fuse the E2E model with one-step DM with lightweight ensemble blocks. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the significant improvement of the proposed Fose on three commonly used benchmarks.

This paper proposes Reasoning Palette, a novel latent-modulation framework that endows the model with a stochastic latent variable for strategic contextualization, guiding its internal planning prior to token generation. This latent context is inferred from the mean-pooled embedding of a question-answer pair via a variational autoencoder (VAE), where each sampled latent potentially encodes a distinct reasoning context. During inference, a sampled latent is decoded into learnable token prefixes and prepended to the input prompt, modulating the model's internal reasoning trajectory. In this way, the model performs internal sampling over reasoning strategies prior to output generation, which shapes the style and structure of the entire response sequence.

While reinforcement learning methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) offer a low-cost alignment solution, their reliance on sparse, outcome-based rewards inadvertently encourages models to \"overthink\" -- generating verbose, convoluted, and unverifiable Chain-of-Thought reasoning to justify answers. This focus on outcomes obscures factual errors and poses significant safety risks. To address this, we propose CheXPO-v2, a novel alignment framework that shifts from outcome to process supervision.

Integrating this with a hard-example mining strategy, our approach significantly outperforms GRPO and state-of-the-art models on benchmarks like MIMIC-CXR-VQA.

However, significant discrepancies in band composition and spatial resolution across different optical sensors present major challenges for existing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). These models are typically pretrained on fixed band configurations and resolutions, making them vulnerable to real world scenarios involving missing bands, cross sensor fusion, and unseen spatial scales, thereby limiting their generalization and practical deployment. To address these limitations, we propose Any Optical Model (AOM), a universal RSFM explicitly designed to accommodate arbitrary band compositions, sensor types, and resolution scales. To preserve distinctive spectral characteristics even when bands are missing or newly introduced, AOM introduces a spectrum-independent tokenizer that assigns each channel a dedicated band embedding, enabling explicit encoding of spectral identity.

A critical failure mode is \"visual forgetting\", where models progressively lose visual grounding as reasoning extends, a phenomenon aptly described as \"think longer, see less\". We posit this failure stems from current training paradigms prematurely entangling two distinct cognitive skills: (1) abstract logical reasoning \"how-to-think\") and (2) strategic visual perception (\"when-to-look\"). This creates a foundational cold-start deficiency -- weakening abstract reasoning -- and a strategic perception deficit, as models lack a policy for when to perceive. In this paper, we propose a novel curriculum-based framework to disentangle these skills. First, we introduce a disentangled Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that builds a robust abstract reasoning backbone on text-only data before anchoring it to vision with a novel Perception-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (PG-CoT) paradigm. Second, we resolve the strategic perception deficit by formulating timing as a reinforcement learning problem. We design a Pivotal Perception Reward that teaches the model when to look by coupling perceptual actions to linguistic markers of cognitive uncertainty (e.g., \"wait\", \"verify\"), thereby learning an autonomous grounding policy. Our contributions include the formalization of these two deficiencies and the development of a principled, two-stage framework to address them, transforming the model from a heuristic-driven observer to a strategic, grounded reasoner. \\textbf{Code}: \\url{https://github.com/gaozilve-max/learning-when-to-look}.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b66\u4e60\u4f55\u65f6\u67e5\u770b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3MLLM\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u201c\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dMLLM\u5728\u957f\u94fe\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u201cthink longer, see less\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u8fc7\u65e9\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u8584\u5f31\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4f55\u65f6\u67e5\u770b\u7684\u7b56\u7565", "method": "\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6587\u672c\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u8026SFT\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u5f3a\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u611f\u77e5\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684PG-CoT\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528Pivotal Perception Reward\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f55\u65f6\u67e5\u770b\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c", "conclusion": "\u5206\u79bb\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u673a\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u89c9\u9057\u5fd8"}}

While existing methods attempt to address these issues by reducing visual tokens or extending model's context length, they may miss useful information or take considerable computation. In fact, when answering given questions, only a small amount of crucial information is required. Therefore, we propose an efficient question-aware memory mechanism, enabling MLLMs to recurrently seek these critical clues. Our approach, named VideoDetective, simplifies this task by iteratively processing video sub-segments. For each sub-segment, a question-aware compression strategy is employed by introducing a few special memory tokens to achieve purposefully compression. This allows models to effectively seek critical clues while reducing visual tokens. Then, due to history context could have a significant impact, we recurrently aggregate and store these memory tokens to update history context, which would be reused for subsequent sub-segments. Furthermore, to more effectively measure model's long video understanding ability, we introduce GLVC (Grounding Long Video Clues), a long video question-answering dataset, which features grounding critical and concrete clues scattered throughout entire videos. Experimental results demonstrate our method enables MLLMs with limited context length of 32K to efficiently process 100K tokens (3600 frames, an hour-long video sampled at 1fps), requiring only 2 minutes and 37GB GPU memory usage.

We present Mitty, a Diffusion Transformer that enables video In-Context Learning for end-to-end Human2Robot video generation. Built on a pretrained video diffusion model, Mitty leverages strong visual-temporal priors to translate human demonstrations into robot-execution videos without action labels or intermediate abstractions.

We propose AnyCXR, a unified framework that enables generalizable multi-organ segmentation across arbitrary CXR projection angles using only synthetic supervision. The method combines a Multi-stage Domain Randomization (MSDR) engine, which generates over 100,000 anatomically faithful and highly diverse synthetic radiographs from 3D CT volumes, with a Conditional Joint Annotation Regularization (CAR) learning strategy that leverages partial and imperfect labels by enforcing anatomical consistency in a latent space. Trained entirely on synthetic data, AnyCXR achieves strong zero-shot generalization on multiple real-world datasets, providing accurate delineation of 54 anatomical structures in PA, lateral, and oblique views. The resulting segmentation maps support downstream clinical tasks, including automated cardiothoracic ratio estimation, spine curvature assessment, and disease classification, where the incorporation of anatomical priors improves diagnostic performance.

However, challenges such as speckle noise, imaging artifacts, irregular lesion morphology, and blurred boundaries severely hinder accurate segmentation. To address these challenges, this work aims to design a robust and efficient model capable of automatically segmenting breast tumors in BUS images.We propose a novel segmentation network named WDFFU-Mamba, which integrates wavelet-guided enhancement and dual-attention feature fusion within a U-shaped Mamba architecture. A Wavelet-denoised High-Frequency-guided Feature (WHF) module is employed to enhance low-level representations through noise-suppressed high-frequency cues. A Dual Attention Feature Fusion (DAFF) module is also introduced to effectively merge skip-connected and semantic features, improving contextual consistency.Extensive experiments on two public BUS datasets demonstrate that WDFFU-Mamba achieves superior segmentation accuracy, significantly outperforming existing methods in terms of Dice coefficient and 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95).The combination of wavelet-domain enhancement and attention-based fusion greatly improves both the accuracy and robustness of BUS image segmentation, while maintaining computational efficiency.The proposed WDFFU-Mamba model not only delivers strong segmentation performance but also exhibits desirable generalization ability across datasets, making it a promising solution for real-world clinical applications in breast tumor ultrasound analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "New WDFFU-Mamba model uses wavelet denoising and dual-attention fusion in U-Net style to boost breast ultrasound tumor segmentation, improving Dice and HD95 and generalization.", "motivation": "BUS images have speckle noise, artifacts, irregular lesion shapes and blurred boundaries; need robust automated segmentation.", "method": "Proposed WHF module for high-frequency denoised enhancement and DAFF module for merging skip and semantic features within U-shaped Mamba network; evaluated on two public BUS datasets showing improved Dice and HD95.", "result": "WDFFU-Mamba integrates wavelet-guided denoising and dual-attention fusion in a U-shaped architecture to improve BUS segmentation.", "conclusion": "Wavelet-domain enhancement plus attention fusion yields superior Dice and HD95, robust and efficient across datasets."}}

Evaluation used an independent, multi-center test set of 2,479 images, including data from a center completely unseen during training to assess generalization.\n  OUTCOMES: Diagnostic performance (Dice Similarity Coefficient [DSC]; Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve [AUC]) and computational efficiency (inference time, GPU memory).\n  RESULTS: Of 15 valid algorithms, the top model (SMART) achieved a macro-averaged DSC of 0.854 across 5 segmentation tasks and AUC of 0.766 for binary classification.

However, previous approaches often struggle to effectively leverage both the visual and linguistic knowledge. Recent efforts have attempted to incorporate Vision-language models (VLMs), which excel at aligning visual and textual features, into universal IR. Nevertheless, these methods fail to utilize the linguistic priors to ensure semantic coherence during the restoration process. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose the Vision-Language Model Guided Image Restoration (VLMIR) framework, which leverages the rich vision-language priors of VLMs, such as CLIP, to enhance IR performance through improved visual perception and semantic understanding. Our approach consists of two stages: VLM-based feature extraction and diffusion-based image restoration. In the first stage, we extract complementary visual and linguistic representations of input images by condensing the visual perception and high-level semantic priors through VLMs. Specifically, we align the embeddings of captions from low-quality and high-quality images using a cosine similarity loss with LoRA fine-tuning, and employ a degradation predictor to decompose degradation and clean image content embeddings. These complementary visual and textual embeddings are then integrated into a diffusion-based model via cross-attention mechanisms for enhanced restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that VLMIR achieves superior performance across both universal and degradation-specific IR tasks, underscoring the critical role of integrated visual and linguistic knowledge from VLMs in advancing image restoration capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVLMIR\uff1a\u7528CLIP\u7b49VLM\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5d4c\u5165\uff0cLoRA\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f4e\u8d28/\u9ad8\u8d28caption\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u964d\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7cross-attention\u6ce8\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u6062\u590d", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591aIR\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0cVLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u5148\u9a8c\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7528\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u7528VLM\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u5f81\uff0cLoRA\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7f\u4f4e/\u9ad8\u8d28\u56fe\u50cfcaption\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u964d\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u964d\u8d28\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u5185\u5bb9\u5d4c\u5165\uff1b2) \u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7cross-attention\u878d\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5d4c\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u542b\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aIR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1", "result": "VLMIR integrates VLM priors into diffusion-based IR", "conclusion": "Integrating visual+linguistic embeddings via VLMs improves restoration, achieving state-of-art across tasks"}}

To address these challenges, we present HiSIR-Net, a High resolution, Self-supervised Reconstruction framework for pixel-wise PCBA localization. Our design combines two lightweight modules that make this practical on real 4K-resolution boards: (i) a Selective Input-Reconstruction Gate (SIR-Gate) that lets the model decide where to trust reconstruction versus the original input, thereby reducing irrelevant reconstruction artifacts and false alarms; and (ii) a Region-level Optimized Patch Selection (ROPS) scheme with positional cues to select overlapping patch reconstructions coherently across arbitrary resolutions. Organically integrating these mechanisms yields clean, high-resolution anomaly maps with low false positive (FP) rate. To bridge the gap in high-resolution PCBA datasets, we further contribute a self-collected dataset named SIPCBA-500 of 500 images.

While feature caching offers a promising training-free acceleration solution by exploiting temporal redundancy, existing methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) uniform caching intervals fail to align with the non-uniform temporal dynamics of DiT, and (2) naive feature reuse with excessively large caching intervals can lead to severe error accumulation. In this work, we analyze the evolution of DiT features during denoising and reveal that both feature changes and error propagation are highly time- and depth-varying. Motivated by this, we propose ProCache, a training-free dynamic feature caching framework that addresses these issues via two core components: (i) a constraint-aware caching pattern search module that generates non-uniform activation schedules through offline constrained sampling, tailored to the model's temporal characteristics; and (ii) a selective computation module that selectively computes within deep blocks and high-importance tokens for cached segments to mitigate error accumulation with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments on PixArt-alpha and DiT demonstrate that ProCache achieves up to 1.96x and 2.90x acceleration with negligible quality degradation, significantly outperforming prior caching-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProCache\u4e3aDiT\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4-\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u8fbe\u6210\u8fd12x\u20132.9x\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u964d\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "DiT\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u9002\u5e94DiT\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u8fc7\u5927\u7f13\u5b58\u95f4\u9694\u4e0b\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u52a0\u901f\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u7f13\u5b58\u6a21\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\uff1a\u79bb\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u91c7\u6837\u6839\u636eDiT\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u5c42\u6df1\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u751f\u6210\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8ba1\u5212\uff1b2) \u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u88ab\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6bb5\uff0c\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u5757\u548c\u91cd\u8981token\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7b97\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728PixArt-alpha\u548cDiT\u6570\u636e\u96c6/\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cProCache\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7ea61.96\u00d7\u548c2.90\u00d7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b64\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faProCache\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3-free\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u7f13\u5b58\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7f13\u5b58\u6a21\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e24\u5927\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DiT\u4e2d\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6f14\u5316\u4e0e\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u3002"}}

As large-scale PBR texture datasets are scarce, our approach focuses on effectively leveraging the embedding space and diffusion priors of pretrained latent image generative models while learning a material latent space, MatLat, through targeted fine-tuning. Unlike prior methods that freeze the embedding network and thus lead to distribution shifts when encoding additional PBR channels and hinder subsequent diffusion training, we fine-tune the pretrained VAE so that new material channels can be incorporated with minimal latent distribution deviation. We further show that correspondence-aware attention alone is insufficient for cross-view consistency unless the latent-to-image mapping preserves locality. To enforce this locality, we introduce a regularization in the VAE fine-tuning that crops latent patches, decodes them, and aligns the corresponding image regions to maintain strong pixel-latent spatial correspondence. Ablation studies and comparison with previous baselines demonstrate that our framework improves PBR texture fidelity and that each component is critical for achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VAE\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u6750\u6599\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u6765\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fPBR\u7eb9\u7406\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578bPBR\u7eb9\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f16\u7801\u65b0PBR\u901a\u9053\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20-\u6f5c\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e3b\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VAE\u4e0a\u9488\u5bf9PBR\u901a\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u6750\u6599\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4MatLat\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u52a0\u5165\u65b0\u901a\u9053\uff1b2) \u8bc1\u660e\u4ec5\u9760\u5bf9\u5e94\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u4fdd\u6301\u6f5c\u5728\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\uff1b3) \u5f15\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1a\u88c1\u526a\u6f5c\u5728\u8865\u4e01\u5e76\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5bf9\u9f50\u5bf9\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u50cf\u7d20-\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u5e94\uff1b4) \u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u4e0e\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u7ebf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5fae\u8c03VAE\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60MatLat\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86PBR\u7eb9\u7406\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a3D\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u6e32\u67d3\uff08PBR\uff09\u7eb9\u7406\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7eb9\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VAE\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u6750\u6599\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08MatLat\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u989d\u5916PBR\u901a\u9053\u65f6\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728-\u56fe\u50cf\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u52a0\u5f3a\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5747\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the de facto choice in modern systems and achieves this by contrasting conditional and unconditional samples. Recent work explores contrasting negative samples at inference using a weaker model, via strong/weak model pairs, attention-based masking, stochastic block dropping, or perturbations to the self-attention energy landscape. While these strategies refine the generation quality, they still lack reliable control over the granularity or difficulty of the negative samples, and target-layer selection is often fixed. We propose Exponential Moving Average Guidance (EMAG), a training-free mechanism that modifies attention at inference time in diffusion transformers, with a statistics-based, adaptive layer-selection rule. Unlike prior methods, EMAG produces harder, semantically faithful negatives (fine-grained degradations), surfacing difficult failure modes, enabling the denoiser to refine subtle artifacts, boosting the quality and human preference score (HPS) by +0.46 over CFG.

However, existing models often struggle to reflect on and correct themselves when attempting incorrect reasoning trajectories. To address this limitation, we propose DRIM, a model that enables deep but reliable multi-turn reasoning when thinking with images in its multimodal CoT. Our pipeline comprises three stages: data construction, cold-start SFT and RL. Based on a high-resolution image dataset, we construct high-difficulty and verifiable visual question-answer pairs, where solving each task requires multi-turn tool calls to reach the correct answer. In the SFT stage, we collect tool trajectories as cold-start data, guiding a multi-turn reasoning pattern.

We introduce CodeDance, which explores executable code as a general solver for visual reasoning. Unlike fixed-schema calls (e.g., only predicting bounding-box coordinates), CodeDance defines, composes, and executes code to orchestrate multiple tools, compute intermediate results, and render visual artifacts (e.g., boxes, lines, plots) that support transparent, self-checkable reasoning. To guide this process, we introduce a reward for balanced and adaptive tool-call, which balances exploration with efficiency and mitigates tool overuse. Interestingly, beyond the expected capabilities taught by atomic supervision, we empirically observe novel emergent behaviors during RL training: CodeDance demonstrates novel tool invocations, unseen compositions, and cross-task transfer. These behaviors arise without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting a general and scalable mechanism of executable visual reasoning.

Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA-VLM) has emerged as a key solution, typically using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to adapt models with minimal data. However, these PEFT methods are constrained by their reliance on fixed, handcrafted prompts, which are often insufficient to understand the semantics of classes. While some studies have proposed leveraging image-induced prompts to provide additional clues for classification, they introduce prohibitive computational overhead at inference. Therefore, we introduce Auxiliary Descriptive Knowledge (ADK), a novel framework that efficiently enriches text representations without compromising efficiency. ADK first leverages a Large Language Model to generate a rich set of descriptive prompts for each class offline. These pre-computed features are then deployed in two ways: (1) as Compositional Knowledge, an averaged representation that provides rich semantics, especially beneficial when class names are ambiguous or unfamiliar to the VLM; and (2) as Instance-Specific Knowledge, where a lightweight, non-parametric attention mechanism dynamically selects the most relevant descriptions for a given image. This approach provides two additional types of knowledge alongside the handcrafted prompt, thereby facilitating category distinction across various domains. Also, ADK acts as a parameter-free, plug-and-play component that enhances existing PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADK consistently boosts the performance of multiple PEFT baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art across various scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAuxiliary Descriptive Knowledge\uff08ADK\uff09\uff1a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u7c7b\u63cf\u8ff0\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec4\u5408\u5e73\u5747\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u8054\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u7684VLM\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u63a8\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dPEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u624b\u5de5\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u6216\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5df2\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u8bf1\u5bfc\u63d0\u793a\u867d\u6709\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u63d0\u793a\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\uff081\uff09\u79bb\u7ebf\u7528LLM\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6761\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1a\u5bf9\u63cf\u8ff0\u7279\u5f81\u6c42\u5e73\u5747\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ece\u63cf\u8ff0\u96c6\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u6587\u672c\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\uff084\uff09\u5c06ADK\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u7ba1\u9053\u6574\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u514d\u8d39\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "ADK\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7c7b\u63cf\u8ff0\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8VLM\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "ADK\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e0\u53c2\u6570\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u65b9\u6cd5\u914d\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u7c7b\u522b\u6b67\u4e49\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, most prior benchmarks rely on low-resolution imagery, and some high-resolution benchmarks suffer from flawed reasoning-task designs. We show that text-only LLMs can perform competitively with multimodal vision-language models on RS reasoning tasks without access to images, revealing a critical mismatch between current benchmarks and the intended evaluation of visual understanding. To enable faithful assessment, we introduce RSHR-Bench, a super-high-resolution benchmark for RS visual understanding and reasoning. RSHR-Bench contains 5,329 full-scene images with a long side of at least 4,000 pixels, with up to about 3 x 10^8 pixels per image, sourced from widely used RS corpora and UAV collections. We design four task families: multiple-choice VQA, open-ended VQA, image captioning, and single-image evaluation. These tasks cover nine perception categories and four reasoning types, supporting multi-turn and multi-image dialog. To reduce reliance on language priors, we apply adversarial filtering with strong LLMs followed by rigorous human verification. Overall, we construct 3,864 VQA tasks, 3,913 image captioning tasks, and 500 fully human-written or verified single-image evaluation VQA pairs. Evaluations across open-source, closed-source, and RS-specific VLMs reveal persistent performance gaps in super-high-resolution scenarios.

Concept erasure techniques offer a promising solution by selectively removing undesired concepts from pre-trained models without requiring full retraining. However, these methods are often evaluated on a limited set of concepts, relying on overly simplistic and direct prompts. To test the boundaries of concept erasure techniques, and assess whether they truly remove targeted concepts from model representations, we introduce EMMA, a benchmark that evaluates five key dimensions of concept erasure over 12 metrics. EMMA goes beyond standard metrics like image quality and time efficiency, testing robustness under challenging conditions, including indirect descriptions, visually similar non-target concepts, and potential gender and ethnicity bias, providing a socially aware analysis of method behavior. Using EMMA, we analyze five concept erasure methods across five domains (objects, celebrities, art styles, NSFW, and copyright). Our results show that existing methods struggle with implicit prompts (i.e., generating the erased concept when it is indirectly referenced) and visually similar non-target concepts (i.e., failing to generate non-targeted concepts resembling the erased one), while some amplify gender and ethnicity bias compared to the original model.", "AI": {"tldr": "EMMA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6db5\u76d612\u9879\u6307\u6807\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u5728\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3001\u95f4\u63a5\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u533a\u5206\u53ca\u793e\u4f1a\u504f\u89c1\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e94\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4e94\u7c7b\u9886\u57df\u540e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u542b\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0b\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u504f\u89c1\u653e\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740T2I\u751f\u6210\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u7248\u6743\u95ee\u9898\u589e\u591a\uff1b\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u5e38\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u5e76\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u5ff5\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u56e0\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u3001\u66f4\u793e\u4f1a\u654f\u611f\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6EMMA\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaEMMA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u300112\u4e2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u5305\u62ec\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6982\u5ff5\u3001\u6027\u522b/\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u7b49\uff1b\u57285\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff08\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u540d\u4eba\u3001\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u3001NSFW\u3001\u7248\u6743\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f305\u79cd\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u4e0a\u6bd4\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff1b\u603b\u4f53\u4e0a\u6ca1\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u80dc\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EMMA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u95f4\u63a5\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u90e8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u6027\u522b\u548c\u79cd\u65cf\u504f\u89c1\u3002"}}

Event cameras address this limitation by capturing per-pixel brightness changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution. Prior research on event-based video frame prediction has leveraged motion information from event data, often by predicting event-based optical flow and reconstructing frames via pixel warping. However, such approaches introduce holes and blurring when pixel displacement is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we propose DESSERT, a diffusion-based event-driven single-frame synthesis framework via residual training. Leveraging a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, our method is trained on inter-frame residuals to ensure temporal consistency. The training pipeline consists of two stages: (1) an Event-to-Residual Alignment Variational Autoencoder (ER-VAE) that aligns the event frame between anchor and target frames with the corresponding residual, and (2) a diffusion model that denoises the residual latent conditioned on event data. Furthermore, we introduce Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT) augmentation, which improves robustness by training on frame segments of varying temporal lengths. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing event-based reconstruction, image-based video frame prediction, event-based video frame prediction, and one-sided event-based video frame interpolation methods, producing sharper and more temporally consistent frame synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DESSERT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u5355\u5e27\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5e27\u95f4\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1aER-VAE\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b8b\u5dee\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u53bb\u566a\u5e76\u4ee5\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff1b\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u65f6\u957f\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08DLT\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u7c7b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f1a\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0b\u4e00\u5e27\u4fe1\u606f\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u65f6\u57df\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u4eae\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u8865\u5145\u8fd9\u4e00\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5149\u6d41\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u57fa\u5143\u7684\u5e73\u79fb\u91cd\u6784\uff0c\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u76f4\u63a5\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e27\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDESSERT\uff1a\u4ee5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Stable Diffusion\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6b8b\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u5e27\u4e0e\u951a\u70b9\u5e27\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) ER-VAE\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5e27\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6b8b\u5dee\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff1b2) \u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b8b\u5dee\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u53bb\u566a\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5f15\u5165Diverse-Length Temporal (DLT)\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u5e27\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cDESSERT\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5355\u4fa7\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u63d2\u503c\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u751f\u6210\u5e27\u66f4\u9510\u5229\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u56e0\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5b54\u6d1e\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6b8b\u5dee\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7ed3\u5408\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\uff0cDESSERT\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u5149\u6d41\u57fa\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5355\u5e27\u5408\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1bDLT\u589e\u5f3a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63d2\u5e27\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Furthermore, training data containing WSIs paired with detailed clinical reports is scarce, restricting progress toward transparent and generalisable VLMs. We address these limitations with three main contributions. First, we introduce Polysome, a standardised tool for synthetic instruction generation. Second, we apply Polysome to the public HISTAI dataset, generating HISTAI-Instruct, a large whole-slide instruction tuning dataset spanning 24,259 slides and over 1.1 million instruction-response pairs. Finally, we use HISTAI-Instruct to train ANTONI-\u03b1, a VLM capable of visual-question answering (VQA). We show that ANTONI-\u03b1 outperforms MedGemma on WSI-level VQA tasks of tissue identification, neoplasm detection, and differential diagnosis. We also compare the performance of multiple incarnations of ANTONI-\u03b1 trained with different amounts of data.

However, traditional explicit warping approaches often struggle with accurate motion transfer or recovering missing regions, while recent attention-based warping methods, though effective, frequently suffer from high complexity and weak geometric grounding. To address these issues, we propose SynergyWarpNet, an attention-guided cooperative warping framework designed for high-fidelity talking head synthesis. Given a source portrait, a driving image, and a set of reference images, our model progressively refines the animation in three stages. First, an explicit warping module performs coarse spatial alignment between the source and driving image using 3D dense optical flow. Next, a reference-augmented correction module leverages cross-attention across 3D keypoints and texture features from multiple reference images to semantically complete occluded or distorted regions. Finally, a confidence-guided fusion module integrates the warped outputs with spatially-adaptive fusing, using a learned confidence map to balance structural alignment and visual consistency.

OmniDirectional Image Super-Resolution (ODISR) is a promising technique for enhancing the visual quality of ODIs. Before performing super-resolution, ODIs are typically projected from a spherical surface onto a plane using EquiRectangular Projection (ERP). This projection introduces latitude-dependent geometric distortion in ERP images: distortion is minimal near the equator but becomes severe toward the poles, where image content is stretched across a wider area. However, existing ODISR methods have limited sampling ranges and feature extraction capabilities, which hinder their ability to capture distorted patterns over large areas. To address this issue, we propose a novel Multi-level Distortion-aware Deformable Network (MDDN) for ODISR, designed to expand the sampling range and receptive field. Specifically, the feature extractor in MDDN comprises three parallel branches: a deformable attention mechanism (serving as the dilation=1 path) and two dilated deformable convolutions with dilation rates of 2 and 3. This architecture expands the sampling range to include more distorted patterns across wider areas, generating dense and comprehensive features that effectively capture geometric distortions in ERP images. The representations extracted from these deformable feature extractors are adaptively fused in a multi-level feature fusion module. Furthermore, to reduce computational cost, a low-rank decomposition strategy is applied to dilated deformable convolutions. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that MDDN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and superiority in ODISR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3ERP\u56fe\u50cf\u7531\u7eac\u5ea6\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u7ea7\u5931\u771f\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u7f51\u7edc\uff08MDDN\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81a8\u80c0\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\u6269\u5c55\u91c7\u6837\u8303\u56f4\u5e76\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA", "motivation": "ERP\u6295\u5f71\u5bfc\u81f4\u7eac\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u6837\u8303\u56f4\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u5931\u771f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5927\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u8def\u5e76\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff1a\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08dilation=1\uff09+\u81a8\u80c0\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\uff08d=2,3\uff09\uff1b\u591a\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\uff1b\u5bf9\u81a8\u80c0\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u5377\u79ef\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff1b\u5728\u516c\u5f00ODISR\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MDDN\uff0c\u591a\u5206\u652f\uff08deformable attention + dilated deformable conv d=2,3\uff09\uff0c\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u964d\u7b97\u529b\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eODISR", "conclusion": "MDDN\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u91c7\u6837\u8303\u56f4\u548c\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbERP\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7eac\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u6355\u83b7\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

A critical limitation of current detectors is their failure to generalize to images from unseen generative models, as they often overfit to source-specific semantic cues rather than learning universal generative artifacts. To overcome this, we introduce a simple yet remarkably effective pixel-level mapping pre-processing step to disrupt the pixel value distribution of images and break the fragile, non-essential semantic patterns that detectors commonly exploit as shortcuts. This forces the detector to focus on more fundamental and generalizable high-frequency traces inherent to the image generation process. Through comprehensive experiments on GAN and diffusion-based generators, we show that our approach significantly boosts the cross-generator performance of state-of-the-art detectors. Extensive analysis further verifies our hypothesis that the disruption of semantic cues is the key to generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6620\u5c04\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u50cf\u7d20\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u7834\u574f\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u901a\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u751f\u6210\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684AI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e0e\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6377\u5f84\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u666e\u9002\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5668\u75d5\u8ff9\u3002\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6291\u5236\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6613\u788e\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u524d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6620\u5c04\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6270\u52a8\u50cf\u7d20\u503c\u5206\u5e03\u4ee5\u6253\u7834\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u64cd\u4f5c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u3001\u9ad8\u9891\u7684\u751f\u6210\u75d5\u8ff9\u800c\u975e\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5728GAN\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8be6\u5c3d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8de8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u9884\u5904\u7406\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u53bb\u9664\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u662f\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6270\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u5f3a\u5236\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5173\u6ce8\u66f4\u666e\u9002\u7684\u751f\u6210\u75d5\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

After that, we propose AIF-D as an extension of AIF-B towards deeper emotional reflection, effectively leveraging generative priors from pre-trained large-scale diffusion models. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that AIF models achieve superior performance for both content consistency and emotional fidelity compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Existing medical VQA datasets are limited in scale, dominated by X-ray imaging or biomedical illustrations, and often prone to text-based shortcuts. RadImageNet-VQA is built from expert-curated annotations and provides 750K images paired with 7.5M question-answer samples. It covers three key tasks - abnormality detection, anatomy recognition, and pathology identification - spanning eight anatomical regions and 97 pathology categories, and supports open-ended, closed-ended, and multiple-choice questions. Extensive experiments show that state-of-the-art vision-language models still struggle with fine-grained pathology identification, particularly in open-ended settings and even after fine-tuning. Text-only analysis further reveals that model performance collapses to near-random without image inputs, confirming that RadImageNet-VQA is free from linguistic shortcuts.

However, for their outputs to get accepted in practice, the results they provide should be explainable in a way easily understood by pathologists. A well-known and widely used explanation technique is occlusion, which, however, can take a long time to compute, thus slowing the development and interaction with pathologists. In this work, we set out to find a faster replacement for occlusion in a successful system for detecting prostate cancer. Since there is no established framework for comparing the performance of various explanation methods, we first identified suitable comparison criteria and selected corresponding metrics. Based on the results, we were able to choose a different explanation method, which cut the previously required explanation time at least by a factor of 10, without any negative impact on the quality of outputs. This speedup enables rapid iteration in model development and debugging and brings us closer to adopting AI-assisted prostate cancer detection in clinical settings. We propose that our approach to finding the replacement for occlusion can be used to evaluate candidate methods in other related applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u6807\u9009\u62e9\u66ff\u4ee3occlusion\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u226510\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u4e14\u65e0\u8d28\u91cf\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5229\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002", "motivation": "Explainable AI needed for clinical acceptance; occlusion is interpretable but slow; need faster alternative preserving quality for prostate cancer detection.", "method": "Define comparison criteria and metrics for explanation methods; evaluate candidates against occlusion; select faster method that maintains output quality.", "result": "Found alternative explanation method that is at least 10x faster with no negative impact on quality, enabling faster iteration and clinical adoption.", "conclusion": "The selection approach can generalize to other applications to replace occlusion with faster explainability methods, facilitating AI adoption in clinical workflows."}}

Built on the MiMo-VL-7B backbone, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B is specialized for smart-home environments, attaining leading F1 scores on gesture recognition and common home-scenario understanding, while also delivering consistent gains across video benchmarks such as Video-MME, Video-MMMU, and Charades-STA, as well as language understanding benchmarks including MMMU-Pro and MMLU-Pro. In our experiments, MiMo-VL-Miloco-7B outperforms strong closed-source and open-source baselines on home-scenario understanding and several multimodal reasoning benchmarks. To balance specialization and generality, we design a two-stage training pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization, leveraging efficient multi-domain data. We further incorporate chain-of-thought supervision and token-budget-aware reasoning, enabling the model to learn knowledge in a data-efficient manner while also performing reasoning efficiently. Our analysis shows that targeted home-scenario training not only enhances activity and gesture understanding, but also improves text-only reasoning with only modest trade-offs on document-centric tasks.

It leverages explicit 3D scene decomposition to represent driving videos as a scene graph, containing static background and dynamic objects. To enable fine-grained editing and realism, it incorporates an agentic pipeline in which an Orchestrator transforms user instructions into execution graphs that coordinate specialized agents and tools. Specifically, an Object Grounding Agent establishes correspondence between free-form text descriptions and target object nodes in the scene graph; a Behavior Editing Agent generates multi-object trajectories from language instructions; and a Behavior Reviewer Agent iteratively reviews and refines the generated trajectories. The edited scene graph is rendered and then refined using a video diffusion tool to address artifacts introduced by object insertion and significant view changes. LangDriveCTRL supports both object node editing (removal, insertion and replacement) and multi-object behavior editing from a single natural-language instruction. Quantitatively, it achieves nearly $2\\times$ higher instruction alignment than the previous SoTA, with superior structural preservation, photorealism, and traffic realism.

To expand the available maritime data, we present a novel multimodal maritime dataset MULTIAQUA (Multimodal Aquatic Dataset). Our dataset contains synchronized, calibrated and annotated data captured by sensors of different modalities, such as RGB, thermal, IR, LIDAR, etc. The dataset is aimed at developing supervised methods that can extract useful information from these modalities in order to provide a high quality of scene interpretation regardless of potentially poor visibility conditions. To illustrate the benefits of the proposed dataset, we evaluate several multimodal methods on our difficult nighttime test set. We present training approaches that enable multimodal methods to be trained in a more robust way, thus enabling them to retain reliable performance even in near-complete darkness.

Despite significant advances, current textured mesh scene reconstruction methods are far from artist ready, suffering from incorrect object decomposition, inaccurate spatial relationships, and missing backgrounds. We present 3D-RE-GEN, a compositional framework that reconstructs a single image into textured 3D objects and a background. We show that combining state of the art models from specific domains achieves state of the art scene reconstruction performance, addressing artists' requirements.\n  Our reconstruction pipeline integrates models for asset detection, reconstruction, and placement, pushing certain models beyond their originally intended domains. Obtaining occluded objects is treated as an image editing task with generative models to infer and reconstruct with scene level reasoning under consistent lighting and geometry. Unlike current methods, 3D-RE-GEN generates a comprehensive background that spatially constrains objects during optimization and provides a foundation for realistic lighting and simulation tasks in visual effects and games. To obtain physically realistic layouts, we employ a novel 4-DoF differentiable optimization that aligns reconstructed objects with the estimated ground plane. 3D-RE-GEN~achieves state of the art performance in single image 3D scene reconstruction, producing coherent, modifiable scenes through compositional generation guided by precise camera recovery and spatial optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "3D-RE-GEN\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u53163D\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u906e\u6321\u8865\u5168\u4e0e4-DoF\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76843D\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u5438\u5f15\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u827a\u672f\u5bb6\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u4fee\u6539\u3001\u6709\u7eb9\u7406\u76843D\u7f51\u683c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "3D-RE-GEN\u7ed3\u5408\u8d44\u4ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5355\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u906e\u6321\u533a\u57df\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u76844-DoF\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5730\u9762\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u786e\u76f8\u673a\u6062\u590d\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u4fee\u6539\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "3D-RE-GEN\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u6709\u7eb9\u74063D\u7269\u4f53\u548c\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u653e\u7f6e\u53ca\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u906e\u6321\u7269\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u5149\u7167\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55 reconstruction\uff0c\u7ed3\u54084\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5dee\u5206\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u5730\u9762\u5e73\u9762\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u9886\u57df\u5185\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5176\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c3D-RE-GEN\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u6062\u590d\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u80cc\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u6548\u548c\u6e38\u620f\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u4fee\u6539\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\u3002"}}

We qualitatively and quantitatively compare LumiCtrl against other T2I customization methods.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve impressive scores on existing benchmarks, a fundamental question remains: can MLLMs truly ground language in vision with human-like sophistication, or are they merely pattern-matching on simplified datasets? Current benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexity where humans effortlessly navigate ambiguous references and recognize when grounding is impossible. To rigorously assess MLLMs' true capabilities, we introduce GroundingME, a benchmark that systematically challenges models across four critical dimensions: (1) Discriminative, distinguishing highly similar objects, (2) Spatial, understanding complex relational descriptions, (3) Limited, handling occlusions or tiny objects, and (4) Rejection, recognizing ungroundable queries. Through careful curation combining automated generation with human verification, we create 1,005 challenging examples mirroring real-world complexity. Evaluating 25 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a profound capability gap: the best model achieves only 45.1% accuracy, while most score 0% on rejection tasks, reflexively hallucinating objects rather than acknowledging their absence, raising critical safety concerns for deployment. We explore two strategies for improvements: (1) test-time scaling selects optimal response by thinking trajectory to improve complex grounding by up to 2.9%, and (2) data-mixture training teaches models to recognize ungroundable queries, boosting rejection accuracy from 0% to 27.9%.

The performance of pathology AI systems has been almost exclusively evaluated on European and US cohorts from large centers. For global AI adoption in pathology, validation studies on currently under-represented populations - where the potential gains from AI support may also be greatest - are needed. We present the first study with an external validation cohort from the Middle East, focusing on AI-based diagnosis and Gleason grading of prostate cancer.\n  Methods: We collected and digitised 339 prostate biopsy specimens from the Kurdistan region, Iraq, representing a consecutive series of 185 patients spanning the period 2013-2024. We evaluated a task-specific end-to-end AI model and two foundation models in terms of their concordance with pathologists and consistency across samples digitised on three scanner models (Hamamatsu, Leica, and Grundium).\n  Findings: Grading concordance between AI and pathologists was similar to pathologist-pathologist concordance with Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa 0.801 vs. 0.799 (p=0.9824).

We present InsertAnywhere, a new VOI framework that achieves geometrically consistent object placement and appearance-faithful video synthesis. Our method begins with a 4D aware mask generation module that reconstructs the scene geometry and propagates user specified object placement across frames while maintaining temporal coherence and occlusion consistency. Building upon this spatial foundation, we extend a diffusion based video generation model to jointly synthesize the inserted object and its surrounding local variations such as illumination and shading. To enable supervised training, we introduce ROSE++, an illumination aware synthetic dataset constructed by transforming the ROSE object removal dataset into triplets of object removed video, object present video, and a VLM generated reference image. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework produces geometrically plausible and visually coherent object insertions across diverse real world scenarios, significantly outperforming existing research and commercial models.", "AI": {"tldr": "See below", "motivation": "See below", "method": "Analyze method, results, conclusions, TL;DR, motivation from abstract", "result": "See below", "conclusion": "See below"}}

However, domain shift often reduces the detector's ability to maintain strong object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter. This weak object focus results in unreliable pseudo-labels from the detection head. While prior works mainly refine these pseudo-labels, they overlook the underlying need to strengthen the feature space itself. We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space. Using class-agnostic binary masks derived from OV-SAM, SPAR promotes structured and foreground-focused activations by guiding the network toward object regions. IRPL (Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling) complements SPAR by promoting balanced and noise-tolerant learning under severe foreground-background imbalance.

We also propose an instance-guided contrastive learning to align 2D semantics with the 3D representations. In addition, to mitigate the high memory and computational cost of dense views, we further propose a geometry-semantic hierarchical sparsification strategy. Our FLEG efficiently reconstructs language-embedded 3D Gaussian representation in a feed-forward manner from arbitrary sparse or dense views, jointly producing accurate geometry, high-fidelity appearance, and language-aligned semantics. Extensive experiments show that it outperforms existing methods on various related tasks.

However, current methods mainly focus on handling humans wearing tight clothing and perform poorly when estimating body shapes and poses under diverse clothing, especially loose garments. To this end, we make two key insights: (1) tailoring clothing to fit the human body can mitigate the adverse impact of clothing on 3D human mesh recovery, and (2) utilizing human visual information from large foundational models can enhance the generalization ability of the estimation. Based on these insights, we propose ClothHMR, to accurately recover 3D meshes of humans in diverse clothing. ClothHMR primarily consists of two modules: clothing tailoring (CT) and FHVM-based mesh recovering (MR). The CT module employs body semantic estimation and body edge prediction to tailor the clothing, ensuring it fits the body silhouette. The MR module optimizes the initial parameters of the 3D human mesh by continuously aligning the intermediate representations of the 3D mesh with those inferred from the foundational human visual model (FHVM). ClothHMR can accurately recover 3D meshes of humans wearing diverse clothing, precisely estimating their body shapes and poses. Experimental results demonstrate that ClothHMR significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across benchmark datasets and in-the-wild images. Additionally, a web application for online fashion and shopping powered by ClothHMR is developed, illustrating that ClothHMR can effectively serve real-world usage scenarios.

However, most prior work extends these networks to predict additional Gaussian parameters -- orientation, scale, opacity, and appearance -- while relying almost exclusively on view-synthesis supervision. We show that a view-synthesis loss alone is insufficient to recover geometrically meaningful splats in this setting. We analyze and address the ambiguities of learning 3D Gaussian splats under self-supervision for pose-free generalizable splatting, and introduce G3Splat, which enforces geometric priors to obtain geometrically consistent 3D scene representations. Trained on RE10K, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in (i) geometrically consistent reconstruction, (ii) relative pose estimation, and (iii) novel-view synthesis.

Depending on the brain tumor type, the FLAIR hyperintensity volume is an important measure to asses the tumor volume or surrounding edema, and an automatic segmentation of this would be useful in the clinic. In this study, around 5000 FLAIR images of various tumors types and acquisition time points from different centers were used to train a unified FLAIR hyperintensity segmentation model using an Attention U-Net architecture. The performance was compared against dataset specific models, and was validated on different tumor types, acquisition time points and against BraTS.

To overcome these challenges, we first present RoomBench++, a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark dataset tailored for this task.

While mainstream video SCI using random binary modulation has demonstrated success, it inevitably results in temporal aliasing during compression. One-hot modulation, activating only one sub-frame per pixel, provides a promising solution for achieving perfect temporal decoupling, thereby alleviating issues associated with aliasing. However, no algorithms currently exist to fully exploit this potential. To bridge this gap, we propose an algorithm specifically designed for one-hot masks. First, leveraging the decoupling properties of one-hot modulation, we transform the reconstruction task into a generative video inpainting problem and introduce a stochastic differential equation (SDE) of the forward process that aligns with the hardware compression process. Next, we identify limitations of the pure diffusion method for video SCI and propose a novel framework that combines one-step regression initialization with one-step diffusion refinement. Furthermore, to mitigate the spatial degradation caused by one-hot modulation, we implement a dual optical path at the hardware level, utilizing complementary information from another path to enhance the inpainted video. To our knowledge, this is the first work integrating diffusion into video SCI reconstruction.

Traditional approaches often rely on extensive labeled data and incur high computational costs. Recent tuning-free methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising alternative by leveraging their rich world knowledge. However, these methods typically rely on textual outputs, which introduces information loss, exhibits normalcy bias, and suffers from prompt sensitivity, making them insufficient for capturing subtle anomalous cues. To address these constraints, we propose HeadHunt-VAD, a novel tuning-free VAD paradigm that bypasses textual generation by directly hunting robust anomaly-sensitive internal attention heads within the frozen MLLM. Central to our method is a Robust Head Identification module that systematically evaluates all attention heads using a multi-criteria analysis of saliency and stability, identifying a sparse subset of heads that are consistently discriminative across diverse prompts. Features from these expert heads are then fed into a lightweight anomaly scorer and a temporal locator, enabling efficient and accurate anomaly detection with interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments show that HeadHunt-VAD achieves state-of-the-art performance among tuning-free methods on two major VAD benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency, validating head-level probing in MLLMs as a powerful and practical solution for real-world anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHeadHunt-VAD\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\uff08tuning-free\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u63d0\u53d6\u5f02\u5e38\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u7684MLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5fae\u5999\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u5229\u7528MLLM\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u5c42\u9762\u83b7\u53d6\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHeadHunt-VAD\uff1a1) Robust Head Identification\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u591a\u51c6\u5219\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6311\u9009\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u5934\uff1b2) \u4ece\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5934\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5668\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u5f02\u5e38\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b3) \u6574\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u51bb\u7ed3\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981VAD\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cHeadHunt-VAD\u5728\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5934\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u5728MLLM\u4e2d\u53ef\u6355\u83b7\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5224\u522b\u6027\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5934\u7ea7\u63a2\u6d4b\u4e3a\u65e0\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, progress has been limited by the absence of public datasets and standardized benchmarks. Existing studies are often not directly comparable, as they use private data and inconsistent evaluation frameworks. To address this, we present MGRegBench, a public benchmark dataset for mammogram registration. It comprises over 5,000 image pairs, with 100 containing manual anatomical landmarks and segmentation masks for rigorous evaluation. This makes MGRegBench one of the largest public 2D registration datasets with manual annotations. Using this resource, we benchmarked diverse registration methods including classical (ANTs), learning-based (VoxelMorph, TransMorph), implicit neural representation (IDIR), a classic mammography-specific approach, and a recent state-of-the-art deep learning method MammoRegNet. The implementations were adapted to this modality from the authors' implementations or re-implemented from scratch. Our contributions are: (1) the first public dataset of this scale with manual landmarks and masks for mammography registration; (2) the first like-for-like comparison of diverse methods on this modality; and (3) an extensive analysis of deep learning-based registration. We publicly release our code and data to establish a foundational resource for fair comparisons and catalyze future research.

Especially models with multiple outputs that can separately predict segmentation classes (regions) without relying on a probabilistic formulation of the segmentation of regions. These models allow for more precise segmentation by tailoring the network's components to each class (region). They have a common encoder part of the architecture but branch out at the output layers, leading to improved accuracy.\n  These methods are used to diagnose type B aortic dissection (TBAD), which requires accurate segmentation of aortic structures based on the ImageTBDA dataset, which contains 100 3D computed tomography angiography (CTA) images. These images identify three key classes: true lumen (TL), false lumen (FL), and false lumen thrombus (FLT) of the aorta, which is critical for diagnosis and treatment decisions. In the dataset, 68 examples have a false lumen, while the remaining 32 do not, creating additional complexity for pathology detection.\n  However, implementing these CNN methods requires a large amount of high-quality labeled data. Obtaining accurate labels for the regions of interest can be an expensive and time-consuming process, particularly for 3D data. Semi-supervised learning methods allow models to be trained by using both labeled and unlabeled data, which is a promising approach for overcoming the challenge of obtaining accurate labels.

We propose a physics-informed, self-supervised framework for qMRI super-resolution that uses routinely acquired HR weighted MRI (wMRI) scans as guidance, thus, removing the necessity for HR qMRI ground truth during training. We formulate super-resolution as Bayesian maximum a posteriori inference, minimizing two discrepancies: (1) between HR images synthesized from super-resolved qMRI maps and acquired wMRI guides via forward signal models, and (2) between acquired LR qMRI and downsampled predictions. This physics-informed objective allows the models to learn from clinical wMRI without HR qMRI supervision. To validate the concept, we generate training data by synthesizing wMRI guides from HR qMRI using signal equations, then degrading qMRI resolution via k-space truncation. A deep neural network learns the super-resolution mapping. Ablation experiments demonstrate that T1-weighted images primarily enhance T1 maps, T2-weighted images improve T2 maps, and combined guidance optimally enhances all parameters simultaneously. Validation on independently acquired in-vivo data from a different qMRI sequence confirms cross-qMRI sequence generalizability. Models trained on synthetic data can produce super-resolved maps from a 1-minute acquisition with quality comparable to a 5-minute reference scan, leveraging the scanner-independent nature of relaxometry parameters. By decoupling training from HR qMRI requirement, our framework enables fast qMRI acquisitions enhanced via routine clinical images, offering a practical pathway for integrating quantitative relaxometry into clinical workflows with acceptable additional scan time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528\u5e38\u89c4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u52a0\u6743MRI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5b9a\u91cfMRI\u771f\u503c\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u80fd\u5c061\u5206\u949f\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u63a5\u8fd15\u5206\u949f\u53c2\u8003\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5b9a\u91cfMRI\u56e0\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5e38\u89c4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u52a0\u6743MRI\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u96c6\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8qMRI\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e34\u5e8a\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65afMAP\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e24\u9879\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff1a\u5408\u6210\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u56fe\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u52a0\u6743\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411\u4fe1\u53f7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387qMRI\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4eceHR qMRI\u751f\u6210wMRI\u5e76\u6a21\u62dfk\u7a7a\u95f4\u964d\u91c7\u6837\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u4f53\u5185\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "Paper proposes physics-informed self-supervised qMRI super-resolution using HR weighted MRI guides, removing need for HR qMRI ground truth.", "conclusion": "Framework enables training without HR qMRI by enforcing consistency with forward signal models and LR qMRI; synthetic training generalizes to real data and yields 1-min acquisitions comparable to 5-min references."}}

This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead.

Existing alignment methods struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between textual descriptions and visual cues across thousands of patches from a slide, compromising their performance on downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose PathFLIP (Pathology Fine-grained Language-Image Pretraining), a novel framework for holistic WSI interpretation. PathFLIP decomposes slide-level captions into region-level subcaptions and generates text-conditioned region embeddings to facilitate precise visual-language grounding. By harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs), PathFLIP can seamlessly follow diverse clinical instructions and adapt to varied diagnostic contexts. Furthermore, it exhibits versatile capabilities across multiple paradigms, efficiently handling slide-level classification and retrieval, fine-grained lesion localization, and instruction following.

Existing methods operate under a closed-world assumption, treating the task as a classification problem over a small, predefined verb set, which struggles to generalize to the long-tail of unseen or ambiguous interactions in the wild. While recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess the rich world knowledge required for open-vocabulary understanding, they remain decoupled from existing HOI detectors since fine-tuning them is computationally prohibitive. To address these constraints, we propose \\GRASP-HO}, a novel Generative Reasoning And Steerable Perception framework that reformulates HOI detection from the closed-set classification task to the open-vocabulary generation problem. To bridge the vision and cognitive, we first extract hybrid interaction representations, then design a lightweight learnable cognitive steering conduit (CSC) module to inject the fine-grained visual evidence into a frozen MLLM for effective reasoning. To address the supervision mismatch between classification-based HOI datasets and open-vocabulary generative models, we introduce a hybrid guidance strategy that coupling the language modeling loss and auxiliary classification loss, enabling discriminative grounding without sacrificing generative flexibility.

Nevertheless, shaping such in-context learning for instruction-based video editing is not trivial. Without specifying editing regions, the results can suffer from the problem of inaccurate editing regions and the token interference between editing and non-editing areas during denoising. To address these, we present ReCo, a new instructional video editing paradigm that novelly delves into constraint modeling between editing and non-editing regions during in-context generation. Technically, ReCo width-wise concatenates source and target video for joint denoising. To calibrate video diffusion learning, ReCo capitalizes on two regularization terms, i.e., latent and attention regularization, conducting on one-step backward denoised latents and attention maps, respectively. The former increases the latent discrepancy of the editing region between source and target videos while reducing that of non-editing areas, emphasizing the modification on editing area and alleviating outside unexpected content generation. The latter suppresses the attention of tokens in the editing region to the tokens in counterpart of the source video, thereby mitigating their interference during novel object generation in target video. Furthermore, we propose a large-scale, high-quality video editing dataset, i.e., ReCo-Data, comprising 500K instruction-video pairs to benefit model training.

Schultz", "Birkan Tunc"], "title": "Bitbox: Behavioral Imaging Toolbox for Computational Analysis of Behavior from Videos", "comment": null, "summary": "Computational measurement of human behavior from video has recently become feasible due to major advances in AI. These advances now enable granular and precise quantification of facial expression, head movement, body action, and other behavioral modalities and are increasingly used in psychology, psychiatry, neuroscience, and mental health research. However, mainstream adoption remains slow. Most existing methods and software are developed for engineering audiences, require specialized software stacks, and fail to provide behavioral measurements at a level directly useful for hypothesis-driven research. As a result, there is a large barrier to entry for researchers who wish to use modern, AI-based tools in their work. We introduce Bitbox, an open-source toolkit designed to remove this barrier and make advanced computational analysis directly usable by behavioral scientists and clinical researchers. Bitbox is guided by principles of reproducibility, modularity, and interpretability. It provides a standardized interface for extracting high-level behavioral measurements from video, leveraging multiple face, head, and body processors. The core modules have been tested and validated on clinical samples and are designed so that new measures can be added with minimal effort. Bitbox is intended to serve both sides of the translational gap.

However, since models must capture both spatial and temporal relationships, performance is limited by the feature representations within a frame but also between multiple frames. We propose the Spatio-Temporal Gaze Network (ST-Gaze), a model that combines a CNN backbone with dedicated channel attention and self-attention modules to fuse eye and face features optimally. The fused features are then treated as a spatial sequence, allowing for the capture of an intra-frame context, which is then propagated through time to model inter-frame dynamics. We evaluated our method on the EVE dataset and show that ST-Gaze achieves state-of-the-art performance both with and without person-specific adaptation. Additionally, our ablation study provides further insights into the model performance, showing that preserving and modelling intra-frame spatial context with our spatio-temporal recurrence is fundamentally superior to premature spatial pooling.

It leverages a transformer-based reconstruction model with structured head query tokens as canonical anchor to aggregate flexible input-number-agnostic, camera-pose-free and expression-free inputs into a robust canonical 3D representation. For detailed dynamic deformation, we introduce a lightweight UNet decoder conditioned on UV-space position maps, which can produce detailed expression-dependent deformations in real time. To better capture rare but critical expressions like wrinkles and bared teeth, we also adopt a data distribution adjustment strategy during training to balance the distribution of these expressions in the training set. Moreover, a lightweight 10-second refinement can further enhances identity-specific details in extreme identities without affecting deformation quality.

However, existing datasets are largely limited to either simulated environments or human-driven vehicle data, lacking authentic ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) vehicle behavior under risk conditions. To address this gap, this paper introduces SAVeD, a large-scale video dataset curated from publicly available social media content, explicitly focused on ADAS vehicle-related crashes, near-miss incidents, and disengagements. SAVeD features 2,119 first-person videos, capturing ADAS vehicle operations in diverse locations, lighting conditions, and weather scenarios. The dataset includes video frame-level annotations for collisions, evasive maneuvers, and disengagements, enabling analysis of both perception and decision-making failures. We demonstrate SAVeD's utility through multiple analyses and contributions: (1) We propose a novel framework integrating semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation to compute real-time Time-to-Collision (TTC) for dynamic objects. (2) We utilize the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution to model and quantify the extreme risk in crash and near-miss events across different roadway types.

Multiple instance learning (MIL) offers a solution by treating each WSI as a bag of patch-level instances, but effectively modeling ultra-long sequences with rich spatial context remains difficult. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising alternative for long sequence learning, scaling linearly to thousands of tokens. However, despite its efficiency, it still suffers from limited spatial context modeling and memory decay, constraining its effectiveness to WSI analysis. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMIL+, a new MIL framework that explicitly integrates spatial context while maintaining long-range dependency modeling without memory forgetting. Specifically, MambaMIL+ introduces 1) overlapping scanning, which restructures the patch sequence to embed spatial continuity and instance correlations; 2) a selective stripe position encoder (S2PE) that encodes positional information while mitigating the biases of fixed scanning orders; and 3) a contextual token selection (CTS) mechanism, which leverages supervisory knowledge to dynamically enlarge the contextual memory for stable long-range modeling. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmarks across diagnostic classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis demonstrate that MambaMIL+ consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance under three feature extractors (ResNet-50, PLIP, and CONCH), highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for large-scale computational pathology", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMambaMIL+\uff1a\u5728Mamba\u4e0a\u52a0\u5165\u91cd\u53e0\u626b\u63cf\u3001S2PE\u548cCTS\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aWSI\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u957f\u7a0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u572820\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "WSI\u5177\u6709\u8d85\u5927\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u5e38\u89c4\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\uff1bMIL\u80fd\u5c06WSI\u89c6\u4e3a\u8865\u4e01\u888b\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5bf9\u8d85\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\uff1bMamba\u867d\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4f46\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u4e0e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728WSI\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "MambaMIL+\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u5927\u8d21\u732e\uff1a1) \u91cd\u53e0\u626b\u63cf\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8865\u4e01\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u53e0\u6ed1\u52a8\u626b\u63cf\u91cd\u6784\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2) \u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6761\u5f62\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5668(S2PE)\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u72b6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u56fa\u5b9a\u626b\u63cf\u987a\u5e8f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u504f\u5dee\uff1b3) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9(CTS)\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u606f\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u5efa\u6a21\u5e76\u907f\u514d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668(ResNet-50\u3001PLIP\u3001CONCH)\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aMambaMIL+\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u5668\u4e0a\u5747\u7a33\u5b9a\u53d6\u5f97\u6216\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MambaMIL+\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Mamba\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u52a0\u5165\u91cd\u53e0\u626b\u63cf\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6761\u5f62\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u5668(S2PE)\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9(CTS)\u4e09\u9879\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5bf9WSI\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u539f\u59cbMamba\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8870\u51cf\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u591a\u9879\u75c5\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A key challenge is generalization, as detectors trained on a narrow class of generators often fail when confronted with unseen models. In this work, we address the pressing need for generalizable detection by leveraging large vision-language models, specifically CLIP, to identify synthetic content across diverse generative techniques. First, we introduce Diff-Gen, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising 100k diffusion-generated fakes that capture broad spectral artifacts unlike traditional GAN datasets. Models trained on Diff-Gen demonstrate stronger cross-domain generalization, particularly on previously unseen image generators. Second, we propose AdaptPrompt, a parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that jointly learns task-specific textual prompts and visual adapters while keeping the CLIP backbone frozen. We further show via layer ablation that pruning the final transformer block of the vision encoder enhances the retention of high-frequency generative artifacts, significantly boosting detection accuracy. Our evaluation spans 25 challenging test sets, covering synthetic content generated by GANs, diffusion models, and commercial tools, establishing a new state-of-the-art in both standard and cross-domain scenarios. We further demonstrate the framework's versatility through few-shot generalization (using as few as 320 images) and source attribution, enabling the precise identification of generator architectures in closed-set settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528CLIP\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6Diff-Gen(10\u4e07\u56fe)\uff1b\u63d0\u51faAdaptPrompt\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3CLIP\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6587\u672cprompt\u548c\u89c6\u89c9adapter\uff1b\u526a\u679d\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u672b\u5c42\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u4f2a\u9020\u75d5\u8ff9\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u572825\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbeSOTA\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u6765\u6e90\u5f52\u5c5e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u751f\u6210\u5668\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u4f2a\u9020\u4e0eGAN\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "(1) \u6784\u5efaDiff-Gen\uff0c\u5927\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5149\u8c31/\u9ad8\u9891\u4f2a\u9020\u75d5\u8ff9\uff1b(2) AdaptPrompt\uff1a\u51bb\u7ed3CLIP\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53ea\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u6587\u672cprompt\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9adapter\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b(3) \u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u7ea7\u6d88\u878d\u53d1\u73b0\u526a\u6389\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2atransformer block\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u4f2a\u9020\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u572825\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff08\u542bGAN\u3001\u6269\u6563\u3001\u5546\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Diff-Gen\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfGAN\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1bAdaptPrompt\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u8de8\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u65b0SOTA\uff1b\u5728\u4ec5320\u5f20\u6837\u672c\u7684few-shot\u60c5\u5f62\u8fd8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u505a\u95ed\u96c6\u6e90\u5f52\u5c5e\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8986\u76d6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f2a\u9020\u7279\u6027\u7684Diff-Gen\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684AdaptPrompt\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u672b\u5c42\u7684\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6765\u6e90\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, fitting NPHMs to visual inputs is notoriously challenging due to the expressive nature of their underlying latent space. To this end, we propose Pix2NPHM, a vision transformer (ViT) network that directly regresses NPHM parameters, given a single image as input. Compared to existing approaches, the neural parametric space allows our method to reconstruct more recognizable facial geometry and accurate facial expressions. For broad generalization, we exploit domain-specific ViTs as backbones, which are pretrained on geometric prediction tasks. We train Pix2NPHM on a mixture of 3D data, including a total of over 100K NPHM registrations that enable direct supervision in SDF space, and large-scale 2D video datasets, for which normal estimates serve as pseudo ground truth geometry. Pix2NPHM not only allows for 3D reconstructions at interactive frame rates, it is also possible to improve geometric fidelity by a subsequent inference-time optimization against estimated surface normals and canonical point maps.

Recent learning-based methods achieve strong performance but rely on large 3D backbones, leading to high memory usage and latency, which limit their use in interactive or resource-constrained settings. We introduce LiteGE, a lightweight approach that constructs compact, category-aware shape descriptors by applying PCA to unsigned distance field (UDFs) samples at informative voxels. This descriptor is efficient to compute and removes the need for high-capacity networks. LiteGE remains robust on sparse point clouds, supporting inputs with as few as 300 points, where prior methods fail. Extensive experiments show that LiteGE reduces memory usage and inference time by up to 300$\\times$ compared to existing neural approaches. In addition, by exploiting the intrinsic relationship between geodesic distance and shape correspondence, LiteGE enables fast and accurate shape matching. Our method achieves up to 1000$\\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art mesh-based approaches while maintaining comparable accuracy on non-isometric shape pairs, including evaluations on point-cloud inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f15\u5165LiteGE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u4f53\u7d20\u4e0a\u5bf9\u65e0\u7b26\u53f7\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\uff08UDF\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u5e76\u505aPCA\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u5f62\u72b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u4e09\u7ef4\u8868\u9762\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u4e91\uff08\u6700\u4f4e300\u70b9\uff09\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6700\u591a300\u00d7\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8fbe1000\u00d7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5148\u8fdb\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b3D\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u548c\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0a\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u901f\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLiteGE\uff1a\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u4f53\u7d20\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837UDF\u503c\uff0c\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u5411\u91cf\u5e94\u7528PCA\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\u53ef\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u4e91\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cLiteGE\u5728\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u76f8\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u9ad8\u51cf\u5c11300\u00d7\uff1b\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6700\u9ad8\u52a0\u901f\u8fbe1000\u00d7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u975e\u7b49\u8ddd\u5f62\u53d8\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u6570\u4f4e\u81f3300\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4f9d\u65e7\u7a33\u5065\u3002", "conclusion": "LiteGE\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408UDF\u91c7\u6837\u4e0ePCA\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6d4b\u5730\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

However, cloud contamination frequently obscures LST observations, limiting their usability for continuous SUHI analysis. Most existing LST reconstruction methods rely on multitemporal information or multisensor data fusion, requiring auxiliary observations that may be unavailable or unreliable under persistent cloud cover. Purely spatial gap-filling approaches offer an alternative, but traditional statistical methods degrade under large or spatially contiguous gaps, while many deep learning based spatial models deteriorate rapidly with increasing missingness.\n  Recent advances in denoising diffusion based image inpainting models have demonstrated improved robustness under high missingness, motivating their adoption for spatial LST reconstruction. In this work, we introduce UrbanDIFF, a purely spatial denoising diffusion model for reconstructing cloud contaminated urban LST imagery. The model is conditioned on static urban structure information, including built-up surface data and a digital elevation model, and enforces strict consistency with revealed cloud free pixels through a supervised pixel guided refinement step during inference.\n  UrbanDIFF is trained and evaluated using NASA MODIS Terra LST data from seven major United States metropolitan areas spanning 2002 to 2025. Experiments using synthetic cloud masks with 20 to 85 percent coverage show that UrbanDIFF consistently outperforms an interpolation baseline, particularly under dense cloud occlusion, achieving SSIM of 0.89, RMSE of 1.2 K, and R2 of 0.84 at 85 percent cloud coverage, while exhibiting slower performance degradation as cloud density increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUrbanDIFF\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4LST\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u50cf\u7d20\u5f15\u5bfc\u7cbe\u70bc\u5f3a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u4e91\u5916\u50cf\u7d20\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\uff08\u9ad8\u8fbe85%\uff09\u4e0b\u5bf9MODIS LST\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08SSIM 0.89\u3001RMSE 1.2K\u3001R2 0.84\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u906e\u6321\u5bfc\u81f4\u536b\u661fLST\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u65f6\u76f8/\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8f85\u52a9\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7a7a\u95f4\u586b\u5145\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5927\u9762\u79ef\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7f3a\u5931\u7387\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUrbanDIFF\uff1a\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u578b\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u5305\u62ec\u5efa\u7b51\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u7b49\u9759\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u52a0\u5165\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u5f15\u5bfc\u7cbe\u70bc\u4ee5\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u975e\u906e\u6321\u50cf\u7d20\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u7f8e\u56fd\u5927\u90fd\u5e02\uff082002\u20132025\uff09\u7684MODIS Terra LST\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u4e91\u63a9\u819c\uff0820%\u201385%\u8986\u76d6\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u572820%\u201385%\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0cUrbanDIFF\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9ad8\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u4e0b\u4f18\u52bf\u660e\u663e\u3002\u572885%\u4e91\u8986\u76d6\u65f6\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97SSIM 0.89\u3001RMSE 1.2 K\u3001R2 0.84\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u4e91\u5bc6\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u6162\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u578b\u7eaf\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u9759\u6001\u57ce\u5e02\u7ed3\u6784\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u9ad8\u4e91\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u57ce\u5e02LST\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3aSUHI\u957f\u671f\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u586b\u8865\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Various stereo-camera based 3D localization methods are available but are limited to few hundreds of meters' range. This is majorly due to the limitation of the distortion models assumed for the non-linearities present in the camera lens. This paper presents a framework for modeling a suitable distortion model that can be used for localizing the objects at longer distances. It is well known that neural networks can be a better alternative to model a highly complex non-linear lens distortion function; on contrary, it is observed that a direct application of neural networks to distortion models fails to converge to estimate the camera parameters. To resolve this, a hybrid approach is presented in this paper where the conventional distortion models are initially extended to incorporate higher-order terms and then enhanced using neural network based residual correction model. This hybrid approach has substantially improved long-range localization performance and is capable of estimating the 3D position of objects at distances up to 5 kilometres. The estimated 3D coordinates are transformed to GIS coordinates and are plotted on a GIS map for visualization. Experimental validation demonstrates the robustness and effectiveness of proposed framework, offering a practical solution to calibrate CCTV cameras for long-range photogrammetry applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u6269\u5c55\u4f20\u7edf\u7578\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6b8b\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5355\u7eaf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u96be\u6536\u655b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8fbe5\u516c\u91cc\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u4e09\u7ef4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u8f93\u51faGIS\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u8ddd\u96e2\u4e09\u7ef4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5bf9\u6444\u50cf\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7578\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7acb\u4f53\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u8fdc\u7a0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8303\u56f4\uff08\u51e0\u767e\u7c73\uff09", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u7578\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u52a0\u5165\u9ad8\u9636\u9879\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5bf9\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8fdc\u8ddd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6700\u591a5\u516c\u91cc\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f30\u8ba1\u76ee\u6807\u4e09\u7ef4\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aGIS\u5750\u6807\u7ed8\u5236\u53ef\u89c6\u5316", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5bf9CCTV\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u96e2\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u6807\u5b9a\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fdc\u7a0b3D\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848"}}

In this work, we introduce AniX, leveraging the realism and structural grounding of static world generation while extending controllable-entity models to support user-specified characters capable of performing open-ended actions. Users can provide a 3DGS scene and a character, then direct the character through natural language to perform diverse behaviors from basic locomotion to object-centric interactions while freely exploring the environment.

We address this gap by introducing Chorus, a multi-teacher pretraining framework that learns a holistic feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene encoder by distilling complementary signals from 2D foundation models. Chorus employs a shared 3D encoder and teacher-specific projectors to learn from language-aligned, generalist, and object-aware teachers, encouraging a shared embedding space that captures signals from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure.\n  We evaluate Chorus on a wide range of tasks: open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, linear and decoder probing, as well as data-efficient supervision. Besides 3DGS, we also test Chorus on several benchmarks that only support point clouds by pretraining a variant using only Gaussians' centers, colors, estimated normals as inputs.

Medical imaging is a particularly demanding domain, requiring long training cycles, high-dimensional data handling, and specialized preprocessing and validation pipelines, capabilities not fully measured in existing agent benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce ReX-MLE, a benchmark of 20 challenges derived from high-impact medical imaging competitions spanning diverse modalities and task types. Unlike prior ML-agent benchmarks, ReX-MLE evaluates full end-to-end workflows, requiring agents to independently manage data preprocessing, model training, and submission under realistic compute and time constraints. Evaluating state-of-the-art agents (AIDE, ML-Master, R&D-Agent) with different LLM backends (GPT-5, Gemini, Claude), we observe a severe performance gap: most submissions rank in the 0th percentile compared to human experts.

Trained on five diverse plant disease datasets, our approach outperforms recent techniques, achieving high accuracy (up to 98.87%) and demonstrating robust generalization.

However, the fundamental design choice of diffusing data all the way to white noise and then reconstructing it leads to an extremely difficult and computationally intractable prediction task. To overcome this limitation, we propose InSPECT (Invariant Spectral Feature-Preserving Diffusion Model), a novel diffusion model that keeps invariant spectral features during both the forward and backward processes. At the end of the forward process, the Fourier coefficients smoothly converge to a specified random noise, enabling features preservation while maintaining diversity and randomness. By preserving invariant features, InSPECT demonstrates enhanced visual diversity, faster convergence rate, and a smoother diffusion process. Experiments on CIFAR-10, Celeb-A, and LSUN demonstrate that InSPECT achieves on average a 39.23% reduction in FID and 45.80% improvement in IS against DDPM for 10K iterations under specified parameter settings, which demonstrates the significant advantages of preserving invariant features: achieving superior generation quality and diversity, while enhancing computational efficiency and enabling faster convergence rate.

Recent benchmarks such as BLINK probe visual perception through visual prompting, where questions about visual content are paired with coordinates to which the question refers, with the coordinates explicitly marked in the image itself. While these benchmarks are an important part of VLM evaluation, we find that existing models are surprisingly fragile to seemingly irrelevant details of visual prompting: simply changing a visual marker from red to blue can completely change rankings among models on a leaderboard. By evaluating nine commonly-used open- and closed-source VLMs on two visually prompted tasks, we demonstrate how details in benchmark setup, including visual marker design and dataset size, have a significant influence on model performance and leaderboard rankings. These effects can even be exploited to lift weaker models above stronger ones; for instance, slightly increasing the size of the visual marker results in open-source InternVL3-8B ranking alongside or better than much larger proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro. We further show that low-level inference choices that are often ignored in benchmarking, such as JPEG compression levels in API calls, can also cause model lineup changes. These details have substantially larger impacts on visually prompted benchmarks than on conventional semantic VLM evaluations. To mitigate this instability, we curate existing datasets to create VPBench, a larger visually prompted benchmark with 16 visual marker variants.

In this work, we present a new method for turning any well-trained ViT-based model into a SEM without retraining, which we call Keypoint Counting Classifiers (KCCs).

To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation. Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, marking a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRadarGen\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u8f66\u7528\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9e1f\u77b0\uff08BEV\uff09\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u96f7\u8fbeRCS\u4e0e\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u62df\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5145\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u6216\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u903c\u771f\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5728BEV\u6805\u683c\u4e0a\u8868\u5f81\u96f7\u8fbe\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u542b\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001RCS\u3001\u901f\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u56fe\u50cf\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8be5BEV\u5730\u56fe\uff1b\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6b65\u9aa4\u5c06\u5730\u56fe\u8f6c\u6362\u56de\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3foundation\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684BEV\u5bf9\u9f50\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cRadarGen\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5178\u578b\u96f7\u8fbe\u6d4b\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u5305\u62ecRCS\u4e0e\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u7edf\u8ba1\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u96f7\u8fbe\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "RadarGen \u4e3a\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u751f\u6210\u4eff\u771f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0e\u96f7\u8fbe\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u4eff\u771f\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While humans naturally coordinate in groups, modeling such interactions remains difficult due to long temporal horizons, strong inter-agent dependencies, and variable group sizes. Existing motion generation methods are largely task-specific and do not generalize to flexible multi-agent generation. We introduce MAGNet (Multi-Agent Diffusion Forcing Transformer), a unified autoregressive diffusion framework for multi-agent motion generation that supports a wide range of interaction tasks through flexible conditioning and sampling. MAGNet performs dyadic prediction, partner inpainting, and full multi-agent motion generation within a single model, and can autoregressively generate ultra-long sequences spanning hundreds of v. Building on Diffusion Forcing, we introduce key modifications that explicitly model inter-agent coupling during autoregressive denoising, enabling coherent coordination across agents. As a result, MAGNet captures both tightly synchronized activities (e.g, dancing, boxing) and loosely structured social interactions. Our approach performs on par with specialized methods on dyadic benchmarks while naturally extending to polyadic scenarios involving three or more interacting people, enabled by a scalable architecture that is agnostic to the number of agents. We refer readers to the supplemental video, where the temporal dynamics and spatial coordination of generated interactions are best appreciated.

Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for untargeted PGD (Projected Gradient Descent) against the visual input modality, and empirically evaluated on the Visual Question Answering (VQA) v2 dataset subset. The results of these adversarial attacks are then quantified using the standard VQA accuracy metric. This evaluation is then compared with the accuracy degradation (accuracy drop) of LLaVA and Llama 3.2 Vision. A key finding is that Llama 3.2 Vision, despite a lower baseline accuracy in this setup, exhibited a smaller drop in performance under attack compared to LLaVA, particularly at higher perturbation levels. Overall, the findings confirm that the vision modality represents a viable attack vector for degrading the performance of contemporary open-weight VLMs, including Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision.

However, current digital twins remain largely static and are limited to navigation and view synthesis without embodied interactivity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Dexterous World Model (DWM), a scene-action-conditioned video diffusion framework that models how dexterous human actions induce dynamic changes in static 3D scenes.\n  Given a static 3D scene rendering and an egocentric hand motion sequence, DWM generates temporally coherent videos depicting plausible human-scene interactions. Our approach conditions video generation on (1) static scene renderings following a specified camera trajectory to ensure spatial consistency, and (2) egocentric hand mesh renderings that encode both geometry and motion cues to model action-conditioned dynamics directly. To train DWM, we construct a hybrid interaction video dataset. Synthetic egocentric interactions provide fully aligned supervision for joint locomotion and manipulation learning, while fixed-camera real-world videos contribute diverse and realistic object dynamics.\n  Experiments demonstrate that DWM enables realistic and physically plausible interactions, such as grasping, opening, and moving objects, while maintaining camera and scene consistency.

We introduce Re-Depth Anything, a test-time self-supervision framework that bridges this domain gap by fusing DA-V2 with the powerful priors of large-scale 2D diffusion models. Our method performs label-free refinement directly on the input image by re-lighting predicted depth maps and augmenting the input. This re-synthesis method replaces classical photometric reconstruction by leveraging shape from shading (SfS) cues in a new, generative context with Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). To prevent optimization collapse, our framework employs a targeted optimization strategy: rather than optimizing depth directly or fine-tuning the full model, we freeze the encoder and only update intermediate embeddings while also fine-tuning the decoder. Across diverse benchmarks, Re-Depth Anything yields substantial gains in depth accuracy and realism over the DA-V2, showcasing new avenues for self-supervision by augmenting geometric reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Re-Depth Anything refines DA-V2 depth at test-time using diffusion-based re-synthesis (SDS) and targeted optimization (freeze encoder, update embeddings and decoder) to exploit shape-from-shading cues, improving depth on diverse benchmarks.", "motivation": "Monocular depth models like DA-V2 fail on out-of-distribution real images due to domain gap; leveraging powerful 2D generative priors at test time can provide additional geometric cues (e.g., shading) without labels.", "method": "At test time, generate re-lit/augmented images from predicted depth and use Score Distillation Sampling with large 2D diffusion models to guide refinement.

To unify vision generation and understanding, a burgeoning trend is to adopt high-dimensional features from representation encoders as generative latents. However, we empirically identify two fundamental obstacles in this paradigm: (1) the discriminative feature space lacks compact regularization, making diffusion models prone to off-manifold latents that lead to inaccurate object structures; and (2) the encoder's inherently weak pixel-level reconstruction hinders the generator from learning accurate fine-grained geometry and texture. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework to adapt understanding-oriented encoder features for generative tasks. We introduce a semantic-pixel reconstruction objective to regularize the latent space, enabling the compression of both semantic information and fine-grained details into a highly compact representation (96 channels with 16x16 spatial downsampling). This design ensures that the latent space remains semantically rich and achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction, while remaining compact enough for accurate generation. Leveraging this representation, we design a unified Text-to-Image (T2I) and image editing model. Benchmarking against various feature spaces, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction, faster convergence, and substantial performance gains in both T2I and editing tasks, validating that representation encoders can be effectively adapted into robust generative components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f85\u8865\u5168", "motivation": "\u5f85\u8865\u5168", "method": "Summarize paper's method, results, conclusions and motivation in brief Chinese", "result": "\u5f85\u8865\u5168", "conclusion": "\u5f85\u8865\u5168"}}
