Improvement of Action Learning in Lifelong Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "For now 10 years, the Action Learning has allowed employees of University of Angers, private and public Companies to be initiated with the design of database, on projects financed by professional structures. These innovating training periods are carried out within the framework of the University College of Further Education of the University of Angers. Database design is a process initially reserved to the professional data processing specialists, coming from French Level-2 technological courses (2-year degrees) or Engineer Schools (Master). The pedagogical model of technological courses has integrated for more than 20 years transverse semester projects, in order to give the students the opportunity to apply newly acquired knowledge, coordinated by teachers. Action Learning requires teachers to assume the role of supervisors for the project management. The objective of Action Learning is to transmit not only knowledge from teachers, but also the experience of consultants to trainees having no competence in data processing, but who have the knowledge of their business process. The present paper shows that Action Learning puts together the factors for success of French technological courses, the adaptability of pedagogy provided to the vocational training, and finally the competence of service provider, Keeping the best parts of those three complementary approaches makes it possible for this kind of formation to achieve teaching and professional, assessable and long lasting goals.

High-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) aims at discovering sequential rules with high utility and high confidence. It can certainly provide reliable information for decision-making because it uses confidence as an evaluation metric, as well as some algorithms like HUSRM and US-Rule. However, in current rule-growth mining methods, the linkage between HUSRs and their generation remains ambiguous. Specifically, it is unclear whether the addition of new items affects the utility or confidence of the former rule, leading to an increase or decrease in their values. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate the problem of mining HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm called SRIU for discovering all HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio using two distinct expansion methods, including left-right expansion and right-left expansion. SRIU also utilizes the item pair estimated utility pruning strategy (IPEUP) to reduce the search space. Moreover, for the two expansion methods, two sets of upper bounds and corresponding pruning strategies are introduced. To enhance the efficiency of SRIU, several optimizations are incorporated. These include utilizing the Bitmap to reduce memory consumption and designing a compact utility table for the mining procedure. Finally, extensive experimental results from both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, to better assess the quality of the generated sequential rules, metrics such as confidence and conviction are employed, which further demonstrate that SRIU can improve the relevance of mining results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSRIU\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6269\u5c55\u3001IPEUP\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u7d27\u51d1\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u6316\u6398\u6548\u7528\u6bd4\u9012\u589e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u89c4\u5219\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u589e\u957f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u65b0\u589e\u9879\u5bf9\u5df2\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6216\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u6548\u7528/\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u6316\u6398\u6548\u7528\u6bd4\u9012\u589e\u7684HUSRs\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u4e24\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u5de6-\u53f3\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53f3-\u5de6\u6269\u5c55\uff09\u3001\u9879\u76ee\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u7528\u526a\u679d\uff08IPEUP\uff09\u3001\u4e3a\u4e24\u79cd\u6269\u5c55\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4f7f\u7528Bitmap\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u4ee5\u53ca\u7d27\u51d1\u6548\u7528\u8868\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6316\u6398\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "SRIU\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8bf4\u670d\u5ea6\uff08conviction\uff09\u7b49\u5ea6\u91cf\u8868\u660eSRIU\u6316\u51fa\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0a\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSRIU\u7684\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6316\u6398\u6ee1\u8db3\u201c\u6548\u7528\u6bd4\u9012\u589e\u201d\u6027\u8d28\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u7528\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5219\uff08HUSRs\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5411\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSRIU\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c4\u5219\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The goal is to discover sequential rules that exhibit both high utility and strong confidence, which are valuable in real-world applications. However, existing high-utility sequential rule mining algorithms suffer from redundant utility computations, as different rules may consist of the same sequence of items. When these items can form multiple distinct rules, additional utility calculations are required. To address this issue, this study proposes a sequential rule mining algorithm that utilizes segmentation guided by confidence (RSC), which employs confidence-guided segmentation to reduce redundant utility computation. It adopts a method that precomputes the confidence of segmented rules by leveraging the support of candidate subsequences in advance. Once the segmentation point is determined, all rules with different antecedents and consequents are generated simultaneously. RSC uses a utility-linked table to accelerate candidate sequence generation and introduces a stricter utility upper bound, called the reduced remaining utility of a sequence, to address sequences with duplicate items.

A k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query is one such example that finds the k closest POIs from an agent's location. While most existing techniques focus on retrieving nearby POIs for a single agent, these search heuristics do not translate to many other applications. For example, Aggregate k Nearest Neighbor (AkNN) queries require POIs that are close to multiple agents. k Farthest Neighbor (kFN) queries require POIs that are the antithesis of nearest. Such problems naturally benefit from a hierarchical approach, but existing methods rely on Euclidean-based heuristics, which have diminished effectiveness in graphs such as road networks. We propose a novel data structure, COL-Tree (Compacted Object-Landmark Tree), to address this gap by enabling efficient hierarchical graph traversal using a more accurate landmark-based heuristic.

A Comparative Evaluation", "comment": null, "summary": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) enables zero-shot recognition of novel categories through vision-language models, achieving strong performance on natural images. However, transferability to aerial imagery remains unexplored. We present the first systematic benchmark evaluating five state-of-the-art OVD models on the LAE-80C aerial dataset (3,592 images, 80 categories) under strict zero-shot conditions. Our experimental protocol isolates semantic confusion from visual localization through Global, Oracle, and Single-Category inference modes. Results reveal severe domain transfer failure: the best model (OWLv2) achieves only 27.6% F1-score with 69% false positive rate. Critically, reducing vocabulary size from 80 to 3.2 classes yields 15x improvement, demonstrating that semantic confusion is the primary bottleneck. Prompt engineering strategies such as domain-specific prefixing and synonym expansion, fail to provide meaningful performance gains. Performance varies dramatically across datasets (F1: 0.53 on DIOR, 0.12 on FAIR1M), exposing brittleness to imaging conditions.

However, most VQA datasets focus on real-world images or simple diagrammatic analysis, with few focused on interpreting complex scientific charts. Indeed, many VQA datasets that analyze charts do not contain the underlying data behind those charts or assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. In reality, charts are transformations (i.e. analysis, simplification, modification) of data. This distinction introduces a reasoning challenge in VQA that the current datasets do not capture. In this paper, we argue for a dedicated VQA benchmark for scientific charts where there is no 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. To do so, we survey existing VQA datasets and highlight limitations of the current field. We then generate synthetic histogram charts based on ground truth data, and ask both humans and a large reasoning model questions where precise answers depend on access to the underlying data.

Vision-Language Models Struggle with Relative Camera Pose Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well in 2D perception and semantic reasoning compared to their limited understanding of 3D spatial structure. We investigate this gap using relative camera pose estimation (RCPE), a fundamental vision task that requires inferring relative camera translation and rotation from a pair of images. We introduce VRRPI-Bench, a benchmark derived from unlabeled egocentric videos with verbalized annotations of relative camera motion, reflecting realistic scenarios with simultaneous translation and rotation around a shared object. We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom. Despite the simplicity of RCPE, most VLMs fail to generalize beyond shallow 2D heuristics, particularly for depth changes and roll transformations along the optical axis.

Code available at : https://github.com/wiskott-lab/single-vs-hier-recon", "summary": "Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u7801\u672c\u5229\u7528\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u5bb9\u91cf\u540e\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u53ef\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42VQ-VAE\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0a\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u8d28\u7591\u5e38\u89c1\u89c2\u70b9\uff1a\u5206\u5c42VQ-VAE\u56e0\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5f00\u800c\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0a\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u9ad8\u5c42\u4ece\u4f4e\u5c42\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u6000\u7591\u82e5\u8868\u793a\u9884\u7b97\u5339\u914d\u4e14\u65e0\u7801\u672c\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u5355\u5c42\u80fd\u5426\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ImageNet\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u4e24\u7ea7VQ-VAE\u4e0e\u5bb9\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5355\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u5468\u671f\u6027\u91cd\u7f6e\u4e0d\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7801\u672c\u5411\u91cf\u53ca\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u53c2\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7801\u672c\u574d\u584c\uff1b\u63a7\u5236\u8868\u793a\u9884\u7b97\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u8ba4\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u7801\u672c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u4e0e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u5e72\u9884\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u574d\u584c\uff1b\u5728\u5339\u914d\u9884\u7b97\u4e0e\u51cf\u5c11\u574d\u584c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u4e24\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u5339\u914d\u8868\u793a\u9884\u7b97\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u7801\u672c\u574d\u584c\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u53d8\u4f53\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u975e\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5929\u7136\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002"}}

We find that the highly sparse spatio-temporal attention patterns exhibited in Video DiTs can be naturally represented by the Monarch matrix. It is a class of structured matrices with flexible sparsity, enabling sub-quadratic attention via an alternating minimization algorithm. Accordingly, we propose VMonarch, a novel attention mechanism for Video DiTs that enables efficient computation over the dynamic sparse patterns with structured Monarch matrices. First, we adapt spatio-temporal Monarch factorization to explicitly capture the intra-frame and inter-frame correlations of the video data. Second, we introduce a recomputation strategy to mitigate artifacts arising from instabilities during alternating minimization of Monarch matrices. Third, we propose a novel online entropy algorithm fused into FlashAttention, enabling fast Monarch matrix updates for long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VMonarch achieves comparable or superior generation quality to full attention on VBench after minimal tuning. It overcomes the attention bottleneck in Video DiTs, reduces attention FLOPs by a factor of 17.5, and achieves a speedup of over 5x in attention computation for long videos, surpassing state-of-the-art sparse attention methods at 90% sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7Monarch\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u5de5\u7a0b\uff08\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316+\u91cd\u7b97+\u5728\u7ebf\u71b5\u66f4\u65b0\uff09\uff0cVMonarch\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e76\u52a0\u901fVideo DiTs\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4e86Video DiTs\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u9891\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e9\u9635\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b50\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eMonarch\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1a1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u65f6\u7a7aMonarch\u5206\u89e3\u4ee5\u5206\u522b\u5efa\u6a21\u5e27\u5185\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u6c42\u89e3\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u91cd\u7b97\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff1b3) \u5c06\u5728\u7ebf\u71b5\u7b97\u6cd5\u878d\u5408\u8fdbFlashAttention\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u66f4\u65b0Monarch\u77e9\u9635\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728VBench\u4e0a\u7ecf\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u8c03\u53c2\u540e\uff0cVMonarch\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5168\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u6ce8\u610f\u529bFLOPs\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea617.5\u500d\uff0c\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc75\u500d\uff0c\u572890%\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VMonarch\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u53ef\u63a7\u7a00\u758f\u7684Monarch\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3001\u91cd\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u71b5\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002"}}

We present C2R (Coarse-to-Real), a generative rendering framework that synthesizes real-style urban crowd videos from coarse 3D simulations. Our approach uses coarse 3D renderings to explicitly control scene layout, camera motion, and human trajectories, while a learned neural renderer generates realistic appearance, lighting, and fine-scale dynamics guided by text prompts. To overcome the lack of paired training data between coarse simulations and real videos, we adopt a two-phase mixed CG-real training strategy that learns a strong generative prior from large-scale real footage and introduces controllability through shared implicit spatio-temporal features across domains. The resulting system supports coarse-to-fine control, generalizes across diverse CG and game inputs, and produces temporally consistent, controllable, and realistic urban scene videos from minimal 3D input.

Our key innovation eliminates explicit geometric projections by using a geometry-aware foundation model with cross-frame attention to implicitly encode 3D scene understanding in feature space. FlexMap features two core components: a spatial-temporal enhancement module that separates cross-view spatial reasoning from temporal dynamics, and a camera-aware decoder with latent camera tokens, enabling view-adaptive attention without the need for projection matrices.

However, their outputs are highly sensitive to prompt variations, which can reveal vulnerabilities in safety alignment. In this work, we present a jailbreak framework that exploits post-training Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to construct stealthy prompts capable of bypassing safety filters. To further increase attack success rates (ASR), we propose a ReAct-driven adaptive noising mechanism that iteratively perturbs input images based on model feedback. This approach leverages the ReAct paradigm to refine adversarial noise in regions most likely to activate safety defenses, thereby enhancing stealth and evasion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed dual-strategy significantly improves ASR while maintaining naturalness in both text and visual domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3CoT\u63d0\u793a\u548cReAct\u9a71\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\u7684VLM\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u534f\u540c\u63d0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u5165\u81ea\u7136\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793aVLM\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "VLM\u5bf9\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u6270\u52a8\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u4ee5\u8054\u5408\u5229\u7528\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5c55\u793a\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u63d0\u5347\u8d8a\u72f1\u6210\u529f\u7387\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524dVLM\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f31\u70b9\u5e76\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u540e\u8bad\u7ec3CoT\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff1a\u6784\u9020\u9690\u853d\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff08jailbreak prompts\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u4ee5\u89c4\u907f\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff1b2) ReAct\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\uff1a\u5229\u7528ReAct\u8303\u5f0f\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u89e6\u53d1\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u533a\u57df\u52a0\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u653b\u51fb\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6709\u65e0\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u53cc\u91cd\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u8bf4\u660e\u6270\u52a8\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u8f83\u4e3a\u9690\u853d\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8fd8\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793aCoT\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u5404\u81ea\u5bf9ASR\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3Chain-of-Thought\u63d0\u793a\u548cReAct\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56fe\u50cf\u6270\u52a8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89c4\u907f\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165CoT\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u9988\u8fed\u4ee3\u8c03\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u81ea\u7136\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66b4\u9732VLM\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the clinical implementation and trust of multi-view markerless motion capture (MMMC) require that, in addition to being accurate, these systems produce reliable confidence intervals to indicate how accurate they are for any individual. Building on our prior work utilizing variational inference to estimate joint angle posterior distributions, this study evaluates the calibration and reliability of a probabilistic MMMC method. We analyzed data from 68 participants across two institutions, validating the model against an instrumented walkway and standard marker-based motion capture. We measured the calibration of the confidence intervals using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The model demonstrated reliable calibration, yielding ECE values generally < 0.1 for both step and stride length and bias-corrected gait kinematics. We observed a median step and stride length error of ~16 mm and ~12 mm respectively, with median bias-corrected kinematic errors ranging from 1.5 to 3.8 degrees across lower extremity joints. Consistent with the calibrated ECE, the magnitude of the model's predicted uncertainty correlated strongly with observed error measures. These findings indicate that, as designed, the probabilistic model reconstruction quantifies epistemic uncertainty, allowing it to identify unreliable outputs without the need for concurrent ground-truth instrumentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5316MMMC\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1a\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e14\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4ECE<0.1\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6307\u793a\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u52a8MMMC\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8981\u6709\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4e2a\u4f53\u7ed9\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u4ee5\u5efa\u7acb\u4fe1\u4efb\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u6982\u7387\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5148\u524d\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u65ad\u4f30\u8ba1\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u7387\u5316\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\uff08MMMC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6765\u81ea\u4e24\u4e2a\u673a\u6784\u768468\u540d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u5e26\u4f20\u611f\u6b65\u9053\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u671f\u671b\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\uff08ECE\uff09\u8861\u91cf\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6b65\u957f\u3001\u8de8\u6b65\u957f\u4e0e\u4e0b\u80a2\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u53ca\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b65\u957f\u4e0e\u8de8\u6b65\u957f\u53ca\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4e0b\u80a2\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6821\u51c6\uff0cECE\u503c\u901a\u5e38\u4f4e\u4e8e0.1\uff1b\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6b65\u957f\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea616 mm\uff0c\u8de8\u6b65\u957f\u7ea612 mm\uff1b\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u8bef\u5dee\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u57281.5\u20133.8\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8ba4\u8bc6\u6027\uff08epistemic\uff09\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5316\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u5730\u9762\u771f\u503c\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap.

However, existing methods primarily support sketch-based interactions for outlining, while the utilization of coarse-grained scribble-based interaction remains limited. Furthermore, current methodologies often encounter challenges due to the abstract nature of scribble instructions, which can result in ambiguous editing intentions and unclear target semantic locations. To address these issues, we propose ScribbleSense, an editing method that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models to effectively resolve these challenges. We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles. Once the semantic intent of the scribble is discerned, we employ globally generated images to extract local texture details, thereby anchoring local semantics and alleviating ambiguities concerning the target semantic locations. Experimental results indicate that our method effectively leverages the strengths of MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art interactive editing performance for scribble-based texture editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "ScribbleSense\u7ed3\u5408MLLM\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u6d82\u9e26\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d82\u9e26\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u7eb9\u7406\u7f16\u8f91\u591a\u652f\u6301\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u8f6e\u5ed3\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5bf9\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u6d82\u9e26\u4ea4\u4e92\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u6d82\u9e26\u6307\u4ee4\u62bd\u8c61\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ece\u6a21\u7cca\u6d82\u9e26\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8bed\u4e49\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u7528MLLM\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u6d82\u9e26\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u6765\u951a\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u7ec6\u8282\u6620\u5c04\u52303D\u7eb9\u7406\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eScribbleSense\u5728\u6d82\u9e26\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63a8\u65ad\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "ScribbleSense\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u6d82\u9e26\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u53473D\u6a21\u578b\u7eb9\u7406\u6d82\u9e26\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002"}}

Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity. These results establish representation-informed diffusion sampling as a practical strategy for reinforcing semantic preservation and image consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u8574\u542b\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u5b58\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8868\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u6295\u5f71\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u5f81\u5230\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u539f\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u53ef\u4e0eclassifier-free guidance\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728SiTs\u548cREPAs\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ImageNet\u7c7b\u6761\u4ef6\u5408\u6210\u7684FID\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982REPA-XL/2\u4ece5.9\u964d\u81f33.3\uff1b\u5bf9SiT\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0eclassifier-free guidance\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u95f4\u6ce8\u5165\u6765\u81ea\u8868\u793a\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6765\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u6f02\u79fb\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

We propose \\textbf{Head Aware Visual Cropping (HAVC)}, a training-free method that improves visual grounding by leveraging a selectively refined subset of attention heads. HAVC first filters heads through an OCR-based diagnostic task, ensuring that only those with genuine grounding ability are retained. At inference, these heads are further refined using spatial entropy for stronger spatial concentration and gradient sensitivity for predictive contribution. The fused signals produce a reliable Visual Cropping Guidance Map, which highlights the most task-relevant region and guides the cropping of a subimage subsequently provided to the MLLM together with the image-question pair.

In this paper, we propose MirrorTalk, a generative framework based on a conditional diffusion model, combined with a Semantically-Disentangled Style Encoder (SDSE) that can distill pure style representations from a brief reference video. To effectively utilize this representation, we further introduce a hierarchical modulation strategy within the diffusion process. This mechanism guides the synthesis by dynamically balancing the contributions of audio and style features across distinct facial regions, ensuring both precise lip-sync accuracy and expressive full-face dynamics.

Nevertheless, the potential of Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models, despite their unified architecture and efficient inference, remains underexplored. In this work, we present DreamVAR, a novel framework for subject-driven image synthesis built upon a VAR model that employs next-scale prediction. Technically, multi-scale features of the reference subject are first extracted by a visual tokenizer. Instead of interleaving these conditional features with target image tokens across scales, our DreamVAR pre-fills the full subject feature sequence prior to predicting target image tokens.

While prevailing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning of black-box backbones, we propose that forgery detection capability is already encoded within pre-trained models rather than requiring end-to-end retraining. To elicit this intrinsic capability, we propose the discriminative neural anchors (DNA) framework, which employs a coarse-to-fine excavation mechanism. First, by analyzing feature decoupling and attention distribution shifts, we pinpoint critical intermediate layers where the focus of the model logically transitions from global semantics to local anomalies. Subsequently, we introduce a triadic fusion scoring metric paired with a curvature-truncation strategy to strip away semantic redundancy, precisely isolating the forgery-discriminative units (FDUs) inherently imprinted with sensitivity to forgery traces. Moreover, we introduce HIFI-Gen, a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark built upon the very latest models, to address the lag in existing datasets. Experiments demonstrate that by solely relying on these anchors, DNA achieves superior detection performance even under few-shot conditions. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable robustness across diverse architectures and against unseen generative models, validating that waking up latent neurons is more effective than extensive fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u4f2a\u9020\u654f\u611f\u5355\u5143\uff08FDUs\uff09\u7684DNA\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03HIFI-Gen\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u53ca\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u9762\u4f2a\u5f71\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u6548\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\u5fae\u8c03\u9ed1\u76d2\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5047\u8bbe\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\u5df2\u7f16\u7801\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7279\u5b9a\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u5524\u9192\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDNA\uff08discriminative neural anchors\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\u8fc1\u79fb\u5206\u6790\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5173\u952e\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u5143\u878d\u5408\u8bc4\u5206\u4e0e\u66f2\u7387\u622a\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u53bb\u9664\u8bed\u4e49\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u63d0\u53d6\u4f2a\u9020-\u5224\u522b\u5355\u5143\uff08FDUs\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6HIFI-Gen\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u951a\u70b9\u7684DNA\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u8d8a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u5524\u9192\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u5173\u952e\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u7684\u201c\u4f2a\u9020\u654f\u611f\u201d\u5355\u5143\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Computer vision approaches have been applied to BCS prediction, with depth images widely used because they capture geometric information independent of coat color and texture. More recently, three-dimensional point cloud data have attracted increasing interest due to their ability to represent richer geometric characteristics of animal morphology, but direct head-to-head comparisons with depth image-based approaches remain limited. In this study, we compared top-view depth image and point cloud data for BCS prediction under four settings: 1) unsegmented raw data, 2) segmented full-body data, 3) segmented hindquarter data, and 4) handcrafted feature data. Prediction models were evaluated using data from 1,020 dairy cows collected on a commercial farm, with cow-level cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Depth image-based models consistently achieved higher accuracy than point cloud-based models when unsegmented raw data and segmented full-body data were used, whereas comparable performance was observed when segmented hindquarter data were used. Both depth image and point cloud approaches showed reduced accuracy when handcrafted feature data were employed compared with the other settings. Overall, point cloud-based predictions were more sensitive to noise and model architecture than depth image-based predictions.

However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

We propose DELNet, a continual learning framework for weather image restoration. DELNet integrates a judging valve that measures task similarity to distinguish new from known tasks, and a dynamic expert library that stores experts trained on different degradations. For new tasks, the valve selects top-k experts for knowledge transfer while adding new experts to capture task-specific features; for known tasks, the corresponding experts are directly reused.

However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8d1f\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u6355\u6349\u5e7b\u89c9\u6839\u6e90\u53ca\u5176\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\uff08\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e0e\u8d1f\u6837\u672c\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u4ea7\u751f\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u2014\u2014\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002"}}

In daily phone use, mobile assistants must track streaming audio-visual inputs and respond at the right time, yet existing benchmarks are often restricted to multiple-choice questions or use shorter videos. In this paper, we introduce PhoStream, the first mobile-centric streaming benchmark that unifies on-screen and off-screen scenarios to evaluate video, audio, and temporal reasoning. PhoStream contains 5,572 open-ended QA pairs from 578 videos across 4 scenarios and 10 capabilities. We build it with an Automated Generative Pipeline backed by rigorous human verification, and evaluate models using a realistic Online Inference Pipeline and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation for open-ended responses. Experiments reveal a temporal asymmetry in LLM-judged scores (0-100): models perform well on Instant and Backward tasks (Gemini 3 Pro exceeds 80), but drop sharply on Forward tasks (16.40), largely due to early responses before the required visual and audio cues appear.

They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem.

Recent methods alleviate this by deriving adaptive signals from attention perspective, but they operate on single dimensions without considering temporal and spatial consistency. To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks.

While previous methods address unified training across multiple datasets, they fail to model geometric relationships in sparse point cloud scenes and ignore the feature distribution in significant areas, which ultimately restricts their performance. To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement.

We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.\n  Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.\n  We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.\n  Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions. LINA achieves competitive performance on both class-conditional and T2I benchmarks, obtaining 2.18 FID on ImageNet (about 1.4B parameters) and 0.74 on GenEval (about 1.5B parameters). A single linear attention module reduces FLOPs by about 61 percent compared to softmax attention.

However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment. By formulating this observation as a theoretical assumption on cross-covariance, we provide a theoretical explanation of how alignment and disentanglement can approximate the concept-matching process through a decomposition of the canonical correlation analysis objective. On the real-world benchmarks, AbC, we show that our unsupervised method surprisingly outperforms the supervised methods. As a starting point, we expect our intuitive insights and experimental findings to provide a fresh perspective on this challenging task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5bf9\u9f50\u52a0\u4e0aInfomax\u53bb\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5f52\u5c5e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u6790\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee3\u4ef7\u9ad8\u6602\u6216\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5f52\u5c5e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4fdd\u62a4\u7248\u6743\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5148\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u5982MoCo\u3001DINO\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u57df\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7Infomax\u635f\u5931\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53bb\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u628a\u8be5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7b49\u4ef7\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u5178\u578b\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u6790\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\uff08AbC\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728AbC\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7adf\u7136\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u9f50+\u53bb\u7ea0\u7f20\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u5339\u914d\u4e0a\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Alignment and Disentanglement\uff0cAbC\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u5ff5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u6700\u5927\u5316\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u8868\u793a\u53bb\u7ea0\u7f20\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5f52\u5c5e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes.

However, previous methods are prone to overfitting the IV classes, leading to the OOV or undefined classes being misclassified as IV ones with a high confidence score. To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot OOV detector (OOVDet), a novel framework that effectively detects predefined classes while reliably rejecting undefined ones in zero-shot scenes. Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption.\n  Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes.

Existing SMPLX-based methods often suffer from slow inference, produce only coarse body poses, and exhibit misalignments or unnatural artifacts in fine-grained regions such as the face and hands. These issues make current approaches difficult to apply to downstream tasks. To address these challenges, we propose PEAR-a fast and robust framework for pixel-aligned expressive human mesh recovery. PEAR explicitly tackles three major limitations of existing methods: slow inference, inaccurate localization of fine-grained human pose details, and insufficient facial expression capture. Specifically, to enable real-time SMPLX parameter inference, we depart from prior designs that rely on high resolution inputs or multi-branch architectures. Instead, we adopt a clean and unified ViT-based model capable of recovering coarse 3D human geometry. To compensate for the loss of fine-grained details caused by this simplified architecture, we introduce pixel-level supervision to optimize the geometry, significantly improving the reconstruction accuracy of fine-grained human details. To make this approach practical, we further propose a modular data annotation strategy that enriches the training data and enhances the robustness of the model. Overall, PEAR is a preprocessing-free framework that can simultaneously infer EHM-s (SMPLX and scaled-FLAME) parameters at over 100 FPS. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements in pose estimation accuracy compared to previous SMPLX-based approaches.

However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation. Additionally, Bi-MCQ reduces the affirmative-negative AUC gap by an average of 0.12 compared to InfoNCE-based fine-tuning, demonstrating that objective reformulation can substantially enhance negation understanding in medical VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u4ece\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6539\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8bed\u4e49\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684Bi-MCQ\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66VLM\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff08InfoNCE\uff09\u7684VLM\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6613\u5f3a\u5316\u79ef\u6781\u5bf9\u5e94\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u75be\u75c5\u7f3a\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u533a\u5206\u80af\u5b9a/\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08Bi-MCQ\uff09\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3Image-to-Text\u548cText-to-Image MCQ\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u80af\u5b9a\u3001\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9762\u5411\u65b9\u5411\u7684Cross-Attention\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e72\u6270\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728ChestXray14\u3001Open-I\u3001CheXpert\u548cPadChest\u4e0a\uff0cBi-MCQ\u76f8\u6bd4CARZero\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5728\u5426\u5b9a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u53470.47 AUC\uff0c\u5728PNC\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u591a0.08\uff0c\u4e14\u5e73\u5747\u7f29\u5c0f\u80af\u5b9a-\u5426\u5b9aAUC\u5dee0.12\uff0c\u6bd4InfoNCE\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Bi-MCQ\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8bed\u4e49\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u533b\u5b66VLM\u5bf9\u5426\u5b9a\u8bed\u53e5\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u80f8\u7247\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5426\u5b9a\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684AUC\u5e76\u7f29\u5c0f\u80af\u5b9a/\u5426\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

However, most post-hoc detection methods operate on penultimate feature representations derived from global average pooling (GAP) -- a lossy operation that discards valuable distributional statistics from activation maps prior to global average pooling. We contend that these overlooked statistics, particularly channel-wise variance and dominant (maximum) activations, are highly discriminative for OOD detection. We introduce DAVIS, a simple and broadly applicable post-hoc technique that enriches feature vectors by incorporating these crucial statistics, directly addressing the information loss from GAP. Extensive evaluations show DAVIS sets a new benchmark across diverse architectures, including ResNet, DenseNet, and EfficientNet. It achieves significant reductions in the false positive rate (FPR95), with improvements of 48.26\\% on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18, 38.13\\% on CIFAR-100 using ResNet-34, and 26.83\\% on ImageNet-1k benchmarks using MobileNet-v2.

Despite its potential, quantization-aware training for VLMs remains underexplored. We propose GRACE, a framework unifying knowledge distillation and QAT under the Information Bottleneck principle: quantization constrains information capacity while distillation guides what to preserve within this budget. Treating the teacher as a proxy for task-relevant information, we introduce confidence-gated decoupled distillation to filter unreliable supervision, relational centered kernel alignment to transfer visual token structures, and an adaptive controller via Lagrangian relaxation to balance fidelity against capacity constraints. Across extensive benchmarks on LLaVA and Qwen families, our INT4 models consistently outperform FP16 baselines (e.g., LLaVA-1.5-7B: 70.1 vs. 66.8 on SQA; Qwen2-VL-2B: 76.9 vs. 72.6 on MMBench), nearly matching teacher performance.

The dataset is constructed using DINOv3-based hierarchical clustering for semantically balanced sampling and Gemini-powered dense captioning, ensuring a uniform distribution across 20 fine-grained garment categories. To support reliable evaluation, we propose a multi-modal protocol that measures VTON quality along five interpretable dimensions: background consistency, identity fidelity, texture fidelity, shape plausibility, and overall realism. The protocol integrates VLM-based semantic reasoning with a novel Multi-Scale Representation Metric based on SAM3 segmentation and morphological erosion, enabling the separation of boundary alignment errors from internal texture artifacts.

Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT.

Existing benchmarks are typically multilingual but text-only, or multimodal but monolingual. Recent multilingual multimodal red-teaming efforts render harmful prompts into images, yet rely heavily on typography-style visuals and lack semantically grounded image-text pairs, limiting coverage of realistic cross-modal interactions. We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks. This underscores the necessity of language- and modality-aware safety alignment beyond mere scaling.To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we will publicly release our benchmark, model checkpoints, and source code.The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/zsxr15/Lingua-SafetyBench.Warning: this paper contains examples with unsafe content.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLingua-SafetyBench\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8de810\u8bed\u79cd\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\uff08100,440\u6761\u6709\u5bb3\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\uff09\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf/\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u9ad8\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u867d\u964d\u4f4e\u6574\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u5374\u52a0\u5267\u4e86HRL\u4e0eNon-HRL\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u4f46\u4ec5\u9650\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f46\u4ec5\u9650\u5355\u8bed\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u56fe\u6587\u914d\u5bf9\u6765\u8986\u76d6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b10\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u3001100,440\u6761\u6709\u5bb3\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b\u572811\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90VLLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5bf9Qwen\u7cfb\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u7248\u672c\u5347\u7ea7\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a(1) \u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u9ad8ASR\uff1b(2) \u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u975e\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u66f4\u4e25\u91cd\uff1b(3) \u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u5347\u7ea7\u964d\u4f4e\u6574\u4f53ASR\uff0c\u4f46\u504f\u5411\u60e0\u53ca\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6269\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u95f4\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u4fbf\u590d\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86Lingua-SafetyBench\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b100,440\u6761\u8de810\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLLMs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u4e0b\uff0c\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08HRL\uff09\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u4e0b\uff0c\u975e\u9ad8\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\uff08Non-HRL\uff09\u66f4\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u7248\u672c\u5347\u7ea7\u603b\u4f53\u964d\u4f4eASR\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9HRL\u7684\u6536\u76ca\u66f4\u5927\uff0c\u6269\u5927\u4e86HRL\u4e0eNon-HRL\u4e4b\u95f4\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfc\u98ce\u9669\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

We propose StreamSense, a streaming detector that couples a lightweight streaming encoder with selective routing to a Vision-Language Model (VLM) expert. StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute. Our results indicate that selective escalation and deferral are effective primitives for understanding streaming social tasks.

To address these issues, we propose FaceDefense, an enhanced proactive defense framework against diffusion-based face swapping. Our method introduces a new diffusion loss to strengthen the defensive efficacy of adversarial examples, and employs a directional facial attribute editing to restore perturbation-induced distortions, thereby enhancing visual imperceptibility.

We first show these approaches have an inherent fidelity-stability dilemma in how they detect anomalies via reconstruction residuals. We then abandon the reconstruction paradigm entirely and propose Retrieval-based Anomaly Detection (RAD). RAD is a training-free approach that stores anomaly-free features in a memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, matching test patches against the memory. Experiments demonstrate that RAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across four established benchmarks (MVTec-AD, VisA, Real-IAD, 3D-ADAM) under both standard and few-shot settings. On MVTec-AD, RAD reaches 96.7\\% Pixel AUROC with just a single anomaly-free image compared to 98.5\\% of RAD's full-data performance.

Concretely, we investigate color correlations induced by the color filter array (CFA) and demosaicing, and propose a Demosaicing-guided Color Correlation Training (DCCT) framework for AI-generated image detection. By simulating the CFA sampling pattern, we decompose each color image into a single-channel input (as the condition) and the remaining two channels as the ground-truth targets (for prediction). A self-supervised U-Net is trained to model the conditional distribution of the missing channels from the given one, parameterized via a mixture of logistic functions. Our theoretical analysis reveals that DCCT targets a provable distributional difference in color-correlation features between photographic and AI-generated images.

On one hand, multi-date approaches using NeRF or Gaussian-splatting jointly model appearance and geometry across many acquisitions, achieving accurate reconstructions on opportunistic imagery with numerous observations. On the other hand, classical stereoscopic reconstruction pipelines deliver robust and scalable results for simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous image pairs. However, when the two images are captured months apart, strong seasonal, illumination, and shadow changes violate standard stereoscopic assumptions, causing existing pipelines to fail. This work presents the first Diachronic Stereo Matching method for satellite imagery, enabling reliable 3D reconstruction from temporally distant pairs. Two advances make this possible: (1) fine-tuning a state-of-the-art deep stereo network that leverages monocular depth priors, and (2) exposing it to a dataset specifically curated to include a diverse set of diachronic image pairs. In particular, we start from a pretrained MonSter model, trained initially on a mix of synthetic and real datasets such as SceneFlow and KITTI, and fine-tune it on a set of stereo pairs derived from the DFC2019 remote sensing challenge. This dataset contains both synchronic and diachronic pairs under diverse seasonal and illumination conditions. Experiments on multi-date WorldView-3 imagery demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses classical pipelines and unadapted deep stereo models on both synchronic and diachronic settings. Fine-tuning on temporally diverse images, together with monocular priors, proves essential for enabling 3D reconstruction from previously incompatible acquisition dates.

In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FarmMind achieves superior segmentation performance and stronger generalization ability compared with existing methods.

Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) concerns safety risks from perception insufficiencies, particularly under adverse conditions where conventional detectors often falter. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations.

To address this, we propose native visual tokenization, which enforces causal dependencies during tokenization. Building on this idea, we introduce NativeTok, a framework that achieves efficient reconstruction while embedding relational constraints within token sequences. NativeTok consists of: (1) a Meta Image Transformer (MIT) for latent image modeling, and (2) a Mixture of Causal Expert Transformer (MoCET), where each lightweight expert block generates a single token conditioned on prior tokens and latent features.

Compared with traditional VTON task, it enables users to tailor digital avatars to their individual preferences, thereby enhancing the virtual fitting experience with greater flexibility and engagement. To address this task, we introduce a Neural Clothing Tryer (NCT) framework, which exploits the advanced diffusion models equipped with semantic enhancement and controlling modules to better preserve semantic characterization and textural details of the garment and meanwhile facilitating the flexible editing of the model's postures and appearances. Specifically, NCT introduces a semantic-enhanced module to take semantic descriptions of garments and utilizes a visual-language encoder to learn aligned features across modalities.

However, the direct transfer of scaling assumptions from CV to RS has not been adequately examined. We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models. In addition, through the explained variance ratio and the feature correlation analysis, we provide mechanistic explanations showing that RS FMs distribute task-relevant information with high redundancy. Our findings establish post-hoc slimmability as both a practical deployment strategy for resource-constrained environments and a diagnostic tool that challenges the prevailing scaling paradigm in RS.

Existing incomplete MDL methods either discard missing modalities, risking the loss of valuable task-relevant information, or recover them, potentially introducing irrelevant noise, leading to the discarding-imputation dilemma. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample. Since direct estimation of such information at test time is intractable due to the unknown data distribution, we theoretically establish a connection between information and the task loss, which we compute at inference time as a tractable proxy. Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on diverse natural and medical image datasets show that DyMo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete/dynamic MDL methods across various missing-data scenarios.

Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.\n  To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images).

Submitted to ICML 2026. 8 pages main text, plus appendix", "summary": "Anomaly detection is often formulated under the assumption that abnormality is an intrinsic property of an observation, independent of context. This assumption breaks down in many real-world settings, where the same object or action may be normal or anomalous depending on latent contextual factors (e.g., running on a track versus on a highway). We revisit \\emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance. To enable systematic study of this setting, we introduce CAAD-3K, a benchmark that isolates contextual anomalies by controlling subject identity while varying context.

Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold. Experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, reaching 0.37 rFID and 26.2 dB PSNR, while maintaining strong semantic alignment to the pretrained VFM.

Preprint version; the final camera-ready version may differ", "summary": "Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting. Extensive experiments on the MVTec and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves strong detection and localization performance, interpretability, and robustness under various levels of data contamination.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u5f02\u5e38\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u4f8b\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u6c61\u67d3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u88ab\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u6c61\u67d3\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u7528\u6807\u6ce8\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u5c11\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u4ec5\u7528\u7eaf\u6b63\u5e38\u6216\u9ed8\u8ba4\u672a\u6c61\u67d3\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6c61\u67d3\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5224\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5f02\u5e38\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u504f\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7531\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u6784\u6210\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\uff1a\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u6570\uff08\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6027\uff09\u3001\u71b5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff08\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u548c\u5206\u5272\u5206\u6570\uff08\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u5e38\u63d0\u793a\uff09\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u4f8b\u52a0\u6743\u7f13\u89e3\u88ab\u6c61\u67d3\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u590d\u5408\u5206\u6570\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec\u4e0eVisA\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0a\u5747\u8d85\u8fc7\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6c61\u67d3\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u826f\u597d\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u5f02\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u504f\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u5408\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u6574\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u71b5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f02\u5e38\u4e09\u65b9\u9762\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6837\u672c\u52a0\u6743\u51cf\u8f7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728MVTec\u4e0eVisA\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6c61\u67d3\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

In practice, acquiring these distances depends on labour-intensive manual interpretation of animal observations across large camera trap video corpora. This study introduces and evaluates an only sparsely explored alternative: the integration of computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) pipelines directly into ecological camera trap workflows for great ape conservation. Using a real-world dataset of 220 camera trap videos documenting a wild chimpanzee population, we combine two MDE models, Dense Prediction Transformers and Depth Anything, with multiple distance sampling strategies. These components are used to generate detection distance estimates, from which population density and abundance are inferred. Comparative analysis against manually derived ground-truth distances shows that calibrated DPT consistently outperforms Depth Anything. This advantage is observed in both distance estimation accuracy and downstream density and abundance inference. Nevertheless, both models exhibit systematic biases. We show that, given complex forest environments, they tend to overestimate detection distances and consequently underestimate density and abundance relative to conventional manual approaches.

Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Hawkeye outperforms state-of-the-art methods and generalizes better across multiple datasets.

We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u5b9e\u8bc1SLImE\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u201c\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u4f4e\u201d\u7684\u5e38\u8bc6\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u9732\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u5373\u4fbf\u65e0\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u4e5f\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6709\u635f\u6620\u5c04\u4f20\u64ad\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSLImE\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u4e0e\u73b0\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GEMINI\u3001COHERE\u3001NOMIC\u3001CLIP\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e13\u95e8\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4ece\u72ec\u7acb\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u8bed\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u8868\u793a\u53ca\u8fde\u8d2f\u63cf\u8ff0\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u6807\u7b7e\u68c0\u7d22\u518d\u5230\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5f00/\u95ed\u6e90\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6062\u590d\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0b\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u96be\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8868\u660e\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u975e\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\uff1b\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0b\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u5efa\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u6cc4\u9732\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

To address this, we introduce Triage, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that reframes video reasoning as a resource allocation problem via hierarchical visual budgeting. Its first stage, Frame-Level Budgeting, identifies keyframes by evaluating their visual dynamics and relevance, generating a strategic prior based on their importance scores. Guided by this prior, the second stage, Token-Level Budgeting, allocates tokens in two phases: it first secures high-relevance Core Tokens, followed by diverse Context Tokens selected with an efficient batched Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm.

Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus.

This improves upon label sampling strategies, where models are trained on mixed annotations, and offers a more principled way to capture inter-rater variability. Experiments on a colorectal organoid dataset annotated by two experts demonstrate that our rater-specific ensemble strategy improves calibration performance while maintaining comparable detection accuracy.

Steering offers a lightweight technique to improve model performance. However, steering, whether input-dependent or input-independent, achieves a meaningful trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we observe that steering vectors can generalize across inputs when tasks share aligned semantic intent. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{OSGA} (\\textbf{O}ne-shot \\textbf{S}teering with \\textbf{G}enerative \\textbf{A}nchor), an input-independent framework that improves model performance with a single optimization instance. OSGA first selects an informative sample via a variance-based data selection strategy and learns a single steering vector with a contrastive objective with generative anchor regularization. The resulting vector can be universally applied at a certain layer during inference time without modifying model parameters.

Existing paradigms rely on either large-scale retrieval, which requires storing a large number of image embeddings, grid-based classifiers that ignore geographic continuity, or generative models that diffuse over space but struggle with fine detail. We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the current methods in the literature, it reduces mean geodesic error by 19.5\\%, while improving the fine-grained subregion accuracy by 43%.

In this paper, we rethink adversarial transferability from a compact subspace perspective and propose CoSA, a transferable attack framework that operates within a shared low-dimensional semantic space. Specifically, each point cloud is represented as a compact combination of class-specific prototypes that capture shared semantic structure, while adversarial perturbations are optimized within a low-rank subspace to induce coherent and architecture-agnostic variations. This design suppresses model-dependent noise and constrains perturbations to semantically meaningful directions, thereby improving cross-model transferability without relying on surrogate-specific artifacts.

Angular misalignments of LiDAR sensors can lead to safety-critical issues during autonomous operation. However, current methods primarily focus on correcting sensor-to-sensor errors without considering the miscalibration of individual sensors that cause these errors in the first place. We introduce FlowCalib, the first framework that detects LiDAR-to-vehicle miscalibration using motion cues from the scene flow of static objects. Our approach leverages the systematic bias induced by rotational misalignment in the flow field generated from sequential 3D point clouds, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The architecture integrates a neural scene flow prior for flow estimation and incorporates a dual-branch detection network that fuses learned global flow features with handcrafted geometric descriptors. These combined representations allow the system to perform two complementary binary classification tasks: a global binary decision indicating whether misalignment is present and separate, axis-specific binary decisions indicating whether each rotational axis is misaligned. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate FlowCalib's ability to robustly detect miscalibration, establishing a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle miscalibration detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowCalib \u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u573a\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u6d41\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u53cc\u5206\u652f\uff08\u5b66\u4e60+\u624b\u5de5\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684 LiDAR-\u8f66\u4f53\u89d2\u5ea6\u9519\u4f4d\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728 nuScenes \u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u805a\u7126\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5355\u4e2a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u81ea\u8eab\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f66\u4f53\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\uff1b\u89d2\u5ea6\u9519\u4f4d\u4f1a\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5f15\u8d77\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5355\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5230\u8f66\u4f53\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u795e\u7ecf\u573a\u6d41\u5148\u9a8c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u8fde\u7eed 3D \u70b9\u4e91\u4f30\u8ba1\u573a\u6d41\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a\u4e00\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u6d41\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u5206\u652f\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u51e0\u4f55\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u878d\u5408\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u662f\u5426\u9519\u4f4d\uff09\u53ca\u6309\u8f74\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u5404\u65cb\u8f6c\u8f74\u662f\u5426\u9519\u4f4d\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728 nuScenes \u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cFlowCalib \u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u68c0\u6d4b LiDAR-\u8f66\u4f53\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5224\u522b\u5168\u5c40\u9519\u4f4d\u4e0e\u6309\u8f74\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowCalib \u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u9759\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u573a\u6d41\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b LiDAR \u4e0e\u8f66\u4f53\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728 nuScenes \u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, related studies on event sensors are scarce or narrowly centered on semantic-level understanding. We introduce SEAL, the first Semantic-aware Segment Any Events framework that addresses Open-Vocabulary Event Instance Segmentation (OV-EIS). Given the visual prompt, our model presents a unified framework to support both event segmentation and open-vocabulary mask classification at multiple levels of granularity, including instance-level and part-level. To enable thorough evaluation on OV-EIS, we curate four benchmarks that cover label granularity from coarse to fine class configurations and semantic granularity from instance-level to part-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our SEAL largely outperforms proposed baselines in terms of performance and inference speed with a parameter-efficient architecture. In the Appendix, we further present a simple variant of our SEAL achieving generic spatiotemporal OV-EIS that does not require any visual prompts from users in the inference.

To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hi-Light, a novel, training-free framework for high-fidelity, high-resolution, robust video relighting. Our approach introduces three technical innovations: lightness prior anchored guided relighting diffusion that stabilises intermediate relit video, a Hybrid Motion-Adaptive Lighting Smoothing Filter that leverages optical flow to ensure temporal stability without introducing motion blur, and a LAB-based Detail Fusion module that preserves high-frequency detail information from the original video. Furthermore, to address the critical gap in evaluation, we propose the Light Stability Score, the first quantitative metric designed to specifically measure lighting consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Hi-Light significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons, producing stable, highly detailed relit videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "Hi-Light\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u7167\u5e73\u6ed1\u548cLAB\u7ec6\u8282\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5149\u7167\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3001\u8f93\u51fa\u5149\u7167\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u95ea\u70c1\u4e25\u91cd\u4ee5\u53ca\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Hi-Light\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u542b\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u5ea6\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\uff08lightness prior anchored guided relighting diffusion\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e2d\u95f4\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u89c6\u9891\uff1b2) \u6df7\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5149\u7167\u5e73\u6ed1\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08Hybrid Motion-Adaptive Lighting Smoothing Filter\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65f6\u5e8f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8eLAB\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08LAB-based Detail Fusion\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u5e76\u63d0\u51faLight Stability Score\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u95e8\u8861\u91cf\u5149\u7167\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u5b9a\u91cf\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cHi-Light\u5728\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u7559\u3001\u5149\u7167\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Light Stability Score\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hi-Light\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9879\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7f3a\u5931\u3001\u5149\u7167\u95ea\u70c1\u4e25\u91cd\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This paper introduces Med-Scout, a novel framework that \"cures\" this blindness via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that leverages the intrinsic geometric logic latent within unlabeled medical images. Instead of relying on costly expert annotations, Med-Scout derives verifiable supervision signals through three strategic proxy tasks: Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection. To rigorously quantify this deficit, we present Med-Scout-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate geometric perception.

In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability.

To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes. These results demonstrate Video-o3's strong multi-hop evidence-seeking and reasoning capabilities, and validate the effectiveness of native tool invocation in long-video scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Video-o3 \u901a\u8fc7\u6309\u6b65\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u9694\u79bb\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff08Seeker-173K\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u8bc1\u636e\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5355\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5197\u4f59\u4fe1\u606f\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u7a00\u758f\u4f46\u5173\u952e\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u68c0\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 Task-Decoupled Attention Masking\uff08\u9694\u79bb\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u5173\u6ce8\u3001\u4fdd\u7559\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff09\u548c Verifiable Trajectory-Guided Reward\uff08\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8986\u76d6\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u957f\uff09\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7ba1\u7ebf\u751f\u6210 Seeker-173K \u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff1aMLVU \u51c6\u786e\u738772.1%\u3001Video-Holmes 46.5%\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u591a\u8df3\u8bc1\u636e\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u539f\u751f\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Video-o3 \u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u8fed\u4ee3\u53d1\u73b0\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec8\u6b62\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9694\u79bb\u6b65\u9aa4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u5f15\u5bfc\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u8df3\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges.

Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues.

While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts. Results show that both models exhibit stable performance under underdetailed and standard prompts, while they suffer degradation under ambiguous prompts. Overdetailed prompts primarily affect GroundingDINO. Prompt enhancement substantially improves robustness under ambiguity, yielding gains exceeding 55% mIoU and 41% average confidence. Based on the findings, we propose several prompting strategies and prompt enhancement methods for OSOD models in XR environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "TL;DR\uff1a\u5728XR\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u63d0\u793a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cOSOD\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6/\u6b20\u7ec6\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8bed\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\uff08\u548cGroundingDINO\u5bf9\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\uff09\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728XR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u793a\u6539\u5199/\u8865\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8OSOD\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\uff1a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fXR\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6216\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5197\u957f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709OSOD\u57fa\u51c6\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u5bdf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u771f\u5b9e\u63d0\u793a\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684OSOD\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5728\u771f\u5b9eXR\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u79cdOSOD\u6a21\u578b\uff08GroundingDINO\u4e0eYOLO-E\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56db\u7c7b\u6a21\u62df\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u6807\u51c6\u3001\u6b20\u7ec6\u5316\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\u3001\u8bed\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u91c7\u7528mIoU\u4e0e\u5e73\u5747\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u5bf9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u4e24\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b20\u7ec6\u5316\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bed\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1bGroundingDINO\u5bf9\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff08mIoU>55%\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6>41%\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff09\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u7f16\u5199\u4e0e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fXR\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cOSOD\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u793a\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u660e\u663e\uff1a\u5bf9\u6b20\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u63d0\u793a\u76f8\u5bf9\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8bed\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff1b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7ec6\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u4e3b\u8981\u5f71\u54cdGroundingDINO\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08mIoU\u63d0\u5347>55%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347>41%\uff09\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6539\u5584XR\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684OSOD\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference Alignment), a data-efficient self-supervised framework that leverages a geometry foundation model to automatically derive dense preference signals that guide VDMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This approach effectively steers the generative distribution toward inherent 3D consistency without requiring human annotations. VideoGPA significantly enhances temporal stability, physical plausibility, and motion coherence using minimal preference pairs, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in extensive experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "VideoGPA\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7DPO\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u55843D\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e09\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7269\u4f53\u53d8\u5f62\u6216\u7a7a\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u95ee\u9898\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u666e\u901a\u53bb\u566a\u76ee\u6807\u672a\u660e\u786e\u9f13\u52b1\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u504f\u597d\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7528\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u6837\u672c\uff08\u5bc6\u96c6\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u597d\u901a\u8fc7DPO\u6574\u5408\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5e03\u503e\u5411\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cVideoGPA\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u6781\u5c11\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faVideoGPA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DPO\uff09\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad83D\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}
