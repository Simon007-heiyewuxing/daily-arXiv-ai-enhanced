*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了Kaguya TC影像压缩导致的视差噪声，提出残差去噪方法并实验证明能显著降低高程噪声，提升月球3D地图质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高从加压缩的Kaguya TC影像恢复得到的月球3D地图的精度，尤其是消除压缩引入的视差图噪声，以支持长距离探测任务如2000 km的月球穿越。

Method: 分析Kaguya TC的JPEG压缩行为与视差噪声特性，识别暗区的系统性噪声模式；设计一种在视差图上进行残差去噪的算法，减少压缩伪影对深度/高程重建的影响；通过实验证明高程噪声降低。

Result: 提出了一种针对压缩影响的视差残差去噪方法，分析了Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为及其在较暗区域产生的系统性视差噪声，并在实验中证明该方法能有效降低高程噪声，提高地形数据的可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过针对压缩伪影和暗区系统性噪声的视差残差去噪策略，能够显著改善由Kaguya TC影像生成的月球3D地形图的高程准确性，从而提升未来长距离月球任务的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在可控设置下对比训练后发现，语言监督使CLIP学到更具语义的表征，提升了文本相关VLM任务表现；数据规模并非唯一因素，改进主要来自监督类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP优于自监督模型（如DINO）作为VLM视觉编码器的原因：是语言监督带来的语义增强，还是CLIP更大训练数据规模的影响。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集与训练配置下重新训练CLIP与DINO，确保两者在ImageNet上达到类似精度；通过嵌入空间分析和将两者作为视觉编码器集成至VLM并在20个VQA基准上评估。

Result: 嵌入分析显示CLIP编码器对高层语义（类别、文本）更敏感，而DINO更关注低层特征（颜色、风格）。在20个VQA任务上，CLIP在文本密集型任务上表现更好，DINO在视觉为主任务上略胜一筹。不同语言监督变体带来的改进有限。

Conclusion: CLIP的优势主要来自语言监督使其学习到更高层语义表示，而非仅仅是训练数据规模差异。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

### [3] [MammoDINO: Anatomically Aware Self-Supervision for Mammographic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11883)
*Sicheng Zhou,Lei Wu,Cao Xiao,Parminder Bhatia,Taha Kass-Hout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了MammoDINO，一种针对乳腺X线摄影（mammography）的自监督学习框架，基于140万张图像预训练，通过“乳房组织感知”的数据增强采样和跨切片对比学习将DBT三维结构引入二维预训练，显著提升了乳腺癌筛查相关任务的性能并具备良好的跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SSL在自然图像上效果显著，但在医学影像特别是乳腺摄影中未被充分利用，部分原因是数据量有限且存在领域特异性偏差。论文旨在通过大规模领域相关的自监督预训练，学习到对临床有用的表征，从而提升下游乳腺癌筛查任务的性能并减少标注需求。

Method: 核心方法包括：1）在1.4M乳腺图像上进行大规模自监督预训练；2）提出乳房组织感知的数据增强采样器，用于图像级和patch级监督，以保证临床相关特征被保留与学习；3）设计跨切片对比学习目标，将DBT的三维结构信息融入二维预训练过程。

Result: 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务上，MammoDINO达到了SOTA性能，并在五个基准数据集上展现出良好跨域泛化能力，证明所提的增强采样器和跨切片对比目标能有效提升表征质量和下游性能。

Conclusion: MammoDINO在多项乳腺癌筛查任务上达到了最先进的性能，并在五个基准数据集上表现出良好泛化，提供了一个可扩展且无需标注的基础模型，有助于构建多用途的CAD工具，降低放射科医生负担并提高筛查效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

*Blessing Agyei Kyem,Neema Jakisa Owor,Andrews Danyo,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Eugene Denteh,Tanner Muturi,Anthony Dontoh,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过将captioning和VQA任务分别交给VideoLLaMA与Qwen2.5-VL并分离训练，论文减少了任务干扰，提升了VQA与时间推理性能，在AI City挑战中取得第10名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通安全分析需要对视频进行细粒度行为理解与全面描述，但单一模型同时训练多任务会导致任务干扰，影响性能，因此提出分离训练以让模型各自专注于不同任务。

Method: 提出了双模型架构：VideoLLaMA专注于captioning（时间推理），Qwen2.5-VL专注于VQA（视觉理解）；采用任务专用优化和分离训练策略，比较了与联合训练的差异，并在WTS数据集上进行评估与消融实验。

Result: VideoLLaMA在时间推理上表现优异（CIDEr=1.1001），Qwen2.5-VL在VQA上取得60.80%准确率；在AI City 2025 Track 2上，方法在WTS数据集获得S2=45.7572，排名第10；分离训练相比联合训练在VQA准确率上提升8.6%，captioning质量不降。

Conclusion: 该论文通过将视频描述（captioning）与视觉问答（VQA）任务分开训练，构建了一个双模型框架，分别使用VideoLLaMA和Qwen2.5-VL，从而减少任务间干扰并提升各自专长，最终在交通安全视频理解上取得了较好性能。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [5] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PanoTPS-Net：CNN预测Thin Plate Spline变换参数，利用TPS层把参考布局扭曲到目标布局，能同时处理立方体和非立方体房间，全景图输入，在多个数据集上达到高3DIoU成绩（约82–92%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve panorama-based room layout estimation and handle cuboid and non-cuboid rooms by learning spatial warping via TPS.

Method: Feature extraction + TPS warping

Result: Two-stage model: CNN predicts TPS parameters; TPS layer warps reference layout to fit input. Achieves strong 3DIoU on four datasets and outperforms SOTA.

Conclusion: TPS变换与全景图结合能有效提高房间布局估计的灵活性与准确性，模型在多个公开数据集上表现稳健，代码开源。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在输入提示中嵌入边界框信息并对四类任务进行有针对性微调，显著提升了仓库场景的空间推理能力，最终在挑战赛中取得第四名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型3D仓库场景中遮挡与杂乱导致基于外观的方法泛化能力差，需引入显式的空间信息以加强模型的几何与布局理解。

Method: 将掩码维度以边界框坐标形式编码到输入提示；对四类问题使用任务特定监督进行微调；在训练集中将标准化答案附加到GPT响应以提高评估一致性。

Result: 提出了一种在大型3D仓库场景中提升空间推理能力的框架。通过将掩码维度（边界框坐标）嵌入输入提示，模型能更好地理解物体几何与布局。对距离估计、物体计数、多选定位与空间关系推理四类问题进行微调，并在训练时将标准化答案附加到GPT输出以提高与评估体系的一致性。最终在AI City Challenge Track 3仓库数据集上取得73.0606分，排名公开榜第四。

Conclusion: 结构化提示增强（边界框坐标）和任务特定优化能有效提升在复杂工业3D场景的空间推理表现，适合应对遮挡与场景杂乱等挑战。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [7] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了多种Vision Transformer（ViT、DeiT、DINO、Swin）及其预训练策略在医疗影像任务上的可解释性，使用Grad-CAM和Gradient Attention Rollout两种可视化方法。主要结论是：DINO+Grad-CAM在两项任务（外周血细胞分类与乳腺超声分类）上提供了最具忠实性和局部化的解释；Grad-CAM总体上生成更具类别区分性和空间精确性的热图，而Attention Rollout激活更为分散；即便在错误分类样本，DINO+Grad-CAM也能突出与临床相关的形态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像中的模型决策解释性直接影响临床信任与采纳，尽管ViT在诊断成像中表现优异，但其复杂的注意力机制使得解释变得困难，本研究旨在评估不同ViT架构及预训练方法在医疗场景下的可解释性，以提高模型透明度与临床应用的可接受性。

Method: 在两个医学影像任务（外周血细胞分类与乳腺超声分类）上，比较ViT、DeiT、DINO、Swin Transformer四种架构与其预训练策略的可解释性。采用两种解释方法：Grad-CAM（基于梯度的类激活映射）与Gradient Attention Rollout（基于自注意力层的注意力展开），对生成的热图进行定量评价（如定位准确性、聚焦度等指标）和定性分析（专家视觉评估，包括错误分类样本的解读）。

Result: 在两项任务的定量与定性实验中，DINO预训练的ViT结合Grad-CAM在定位准确性和热图局部性上领先；Grad-CAM总体提供了更具类别区分性和空间精确性的解释，而Gradient Attention Rollout的激活模式较为分散；在错误分类样本中，DINO+Grad-CAM仍能突出与临床相关的误导性形态特征，说明其解释对理解模型出错原因有参考价值。

Conclusion: DINO预训练结合Grad-CAM能够为ViT类模型在医疗影像中的决策提供最可信、局部化且具临床相关性的解释，推动其在临床诊断流程中可解释性与可靠性的整合。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

### [8] [APGNet: Adaptive Prior-Guided for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12056)
*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出APGNet：MSRCR增强 + Siamese架构 + ERF+MPD + 自适应先验引导（空间注意力与可变形卷积），在两个MAS数据集上优于15种方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是水下图像常受对比度低和颜色失真影响，且海洋生物具有天然伪装，传统增强和陆地COD方法难以同时应对成像退化与伪装目标检测，因此需设计专门考虑水下光学特性的检测网络。

Method: 方法包括：1) 用MSRCR生成光照不变图像作为增强；2) Siamese主干并行处理原图与增强图；3) ERF模块扩大感受野，MPD逐步融合多尺度特征；4) 自适应先验引导：高层嵌入空间注意力用于位置先验，低层用可变形卷积结合边界先验进行细化。

Result: APGNet提出一种结合先验引导机制的Siamese网络，用于水下伪装目标检测，通过MSRCR数据增强、ERF模块与MPD解码器、多层次位置与边界先验融合，实现对低对比度与颜色失真图像中伪装目标的鲁棒检测。

Conclusion: APGNet通过多尺度上下文捕获与层次化先验融合，有效缓解水下成像退化与目标伪装问题，显著提升检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

### [9] [VIDMP3: Video Editing by Representing Motion with Pose and Position Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12069)
*Sandeep Mishra,Oindrila Saha,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidMP3 learns generalized motion representation from pose and position priors to enable motion-preserved, structure-variable video editing with improved consistency and identity preservation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable motion-preserved video editing that allows structure and semantic flexibility while addressing temporal inconsistency and identity drift in prior methods

Method: VidMP3: pose and position priors to learn motion representation

Result: Generates new videos maintaining original motion with structural/semantic flexibility; outperforms existing methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations

Conclusion: VidMP3 provides superior motion-preserving editing via pose/position priors, facilitating flexible structural/semantic swaps with better temporal consistency and identity retention

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

TL;DR: 本论文讨论如何利用域适应技术在缺乏目标域标注时，将在源域训练的图像分类模型迁移到不同但相关的目标域，以减少标注需求并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标注数据稀缺问题，使在源域训练的模型能在目标域上泛化，降低人工标注成本并扩大视觉模型适用性。

Method: 回顾并比较常见方法：基于统计对齐（如MMD）、对抗域分类器（DANN）、生成方法（GAN用于风格迁移）、自监督预训练与伪标签策略；讨论无监督域适应与少量标注的半监督策略。

Result: 综述域适应（Domain Adaptation）概念和方法，介绍可用技术如对抗训练、特征对齐、重构与自监督方法，并举例（如从绘画到真实飞机图像的迁移）。强调域间分布差异、无监督/半监督设定与评估指标。

Conclusion: 域适应在缓解标注数据匮乏方面有效，结合对抗学习、域对齐和自监督可提升跨域性能，但仍面临特征不可对齐和类别偏移等挑战，需在数据多样性与模型稳健性上继续研究。

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于Diffusion Transformer（DiT）的音频驱动多人视频生成框架，通过LoRA训练、位置偏移推理、部分参数更新结合奖励反馈以及Mask-CFG实现高质量、长时序一致且支持多角色的说话视频生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM驱动的3D场景生成缺乏多样、高质量的训练数据，尤其是在室内布局和实物实例级语义描述方面；为提升通用化与下游视觉任务性能，需要一个大规模、多模态且高保真的数据集。

Abstract: In this study, we present IL3D, a large-scale dataset meticulously designed
for large language model (LLM)-driven 3D scene generation, addressing the
pressing demand for diverse, high-quality training data in indoor layout
design. Comprising 27,816 indoor layouts across 18 prevalent room types and a
library of 29,215 high-fidelity 3D object assets, IL3D is enriched with
instance-level natural language annotations to support robust multimodal
learning for vision-language tasks. We establish rigorous benchmarks to
evaluate LLM-driven scene generation. Experimental results show that supervised

surpasses the performance of SFT on other datasets. IL3D offers flexible
multimodal data export capabilities, including point clouds, 3D bounding boxes,
multiview images, depth maps, normal maps, and semantic masks, enabling
seamless adaptation to various visual tasks. As a versatile and robust
resource, IL3D significantly advances research in 3D scene generation and
embodied intelligence, by providing high-fidelity scene data to support
environment perception tasks of embodied agents.

Motivation: 二维码去模糊关注能否成功解码而非主观视觉质量；二维码具有规则且锐利的边缘结构，应作为强先验显式利用，但现有深度方法少有利用该先验。

Method: 提出EGAB模块将边缘特征显式融入注意力机制，并以此构建基于Restormer的EG-Restormer，另设计轻量LENet用于快速去模糊，最终通过模糊程度判别器实现ADNet在两网之间动态切换。

Result: 在大量实验中，EG-Restormer与ADNet在解码率和速度上优于现有方法，尤其在严重模糊场景下显著提升解码成功率，同时在轻度模糊下保持较低计算开销。

Conclusion: 引入边缘先验的EGAB能显著提升二维码去模糊的解码率，EG-Restormer在严重模糊场景表现最佳，LENet在轻度模糊下高效快速，ADNet在移动设备上兼顾性能与效率，整体达到SOTA。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

Motivation: 非重放类增量学习面临模型复杂度逐步增加、表示在增量阶段中不平滑变化以及阶段内局部优化与最终全局推理不一致的三重难题，亟需在高效性与表现之间找到平衡的方案。

Method: 建立在预训练模型之上，逐阶段增加轻量的并行适配器(IPA)，通过传递门继承并传播表示能力以保证表示平滑转移；同时设计解耦锚监督(DAS)，分别将正负样本与虚拟锚比较以促进判别性表示并对齐不同阶段的特征空间。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，DRL在整个增量过程均优于现有最先进方法，同时在训练和推理阶段保持高效。

Conclusion: DRL通过IPA和DAS有效解决了非重放增量学习中的模型复杂度增长、表示迁移不平滑及阶段性优化与全局推理不一致的问题，在多数据集上显著提升性能并保持训练/推理效率。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

TL;DR: 提出SSDiff：用弱引导扩散生成伪参考，并在去噪过程按结构先行、色彩后细化进行选择性修复，结合解析图和划痕掩码，显著提升旧照片人脸恢复效果并提供新基准VintageFace。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旧照片人脸恢复中局部严重退化（断裂、褪色、模糊）难以修复的问题，现有方法对局部伪影或肤色恢复不足。提出自监督选择性引导扩散框架，利用弱引导生成的伪参考进行区域性修复，避免身份错配。

Method: 用预训练扩散模型在弱指导下生成伪参考人脸；在去噪全过程施加结构引导、在后期施加颜色精细化引导；采用人脸解析图与划痕掩码实现仅对损坏区域进行替换式或融合式修复；构建并测试VintageFace基准，与GAN及其他扩散方法对比评估。

Result: 提出SSDiff，通过弱引导预训练扩散模型生成结构对齐且色彩自然的伪参考，并在扩散去噪过程分阶段分别提供结构和色彩引导；结合人脸解析与划痕掩码实现选择性修复。构建VintageFace基准并在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff在保留身份、改善局部断裂与色彩恢复方面表现优越，展示了利用伪标签与阶段化引导在扩散去噪中实现区域可控恢复的可行性和有效性。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

Conclusion: ImageSentinel通过合成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，并嵌入可检索的随机字符序列作为检索密钥，实现了在检索增强图像生成（RAIG）系统中对私有视觉数据集的防护与未经授权使用的检测。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出在硬件约束（带宽、峰值功率、传感器资源）下，通过受限优化设计编码函数（联合优化照明与编码矩阵）以提升单光子TOF成像的压缩直方图性能；用梯度下降并在仿真与真实非理想脉冲响应上验证优于传统设计，尤其在峰值功率受限时提升明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单光子相机的硬件限制（系统带宽、激光峰值功率、传感器数据率及片内资源）导致压缩直方图方法在真实条件下性能下降，需要设计能满足实际硬件约束的编码函数以改善3D成像性能。

Method: 建立带硬件约束的优化问题，对照明与编码矩阵联合参数化并用梯度下降求解；在仿真中比较不同约束（带宽、峰值功率）下的性能，并在具有非理想脉冲响应的真实系统上进行评估。

Result: 在广泛仿真中，受约束优化得到的编码函数在带宽与峰值功率受限时均优于传统设计，峰值功率受限时优势尤为显著；在真实非理想脉冲响应系统上也验证了方法的适应性与有效性。

Conclusion: 受约束的联合优化编码函数在实际硬件限制下显著优于传统编码设计，尤其在峰值功率受限场景，并能适配任意参数化的脉冲响应。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Result: CapFlow achieves GPT-4.1-level caption quality with 89.5% cost reduction; MetaCaptioner fine-tuned on CapFlow data attains comparable commercial captioning and top-tier multimodal performance in open-source

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为经济高效的通用视觉描述提供了解决方案，有助推动多模态研究与应用。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Motivation: 远程生理测量需保护隐私且现实部署中大量用户数据无标签，现有接触式或基于标签的方法无法直接用于客户端无标签且跨域分布差异大的场景，因此设计联邦无监督域泛化协议与相应方法。

Method: 引入Minimal Bias Aggregation（基于先验偏差评估动态调整聚合权重）与Global Distribution-aware Learning Controller（参数化标签分布并动态调整客户端训练策略）来应对特征异质性与标签分布偏斜及长尾问题。

Result: 在不同数据模态（RGB视频、mmWave雷达）上，FedHUG较现有方法表现更优，实验验证了其在非IID特征、标签分布偏斜与长尾问题上的鲁棒性与泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出FedHUG框架在联邦无监督域泛化（FUDG）任务中，通过自适应聚合与分布感知控制有效提升跨域生理信号估计性能，适用于RGB视频与mmWave雷达输入。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出KFF：类感知的知识裂变与融合机制，在测试时动态分离/合并域知识以同时避免灾难性遗忘和有害历史干扰，实验在ImageNet-C上表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型减缓灾难性遗忘，但容易导致新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，因而需要一种能在保留有用历史知识同时高效学习新域知识的机制。

Method: 设计了KFI模块从类感知域提示池中自适应裂变出当前域新知识，以减轻与当前域差异较大旧域知识的负面影响；并设计了KFU模块以贪婪的动态合并策略将新裂变出的知识高效合并回知识池，控制计算与存储成本。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上进行的大量实验显示，KFF较现有方法在CTTA任务上取得了更好的性能，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该文提出了KFF方法，通过类感知的知识裂变(KFI)与融合(KFU)模块，在测试时流式域数据中动态分离并合并领域知识，旨在缓解历史知识有害干扰并保持新知识学习能力，从而提升CTTA性能。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决一次性医学图像分割中由于标注样本极少且患者间解剖差异大导致的原型表示不足问题。传统基于原型的方法通过确定性平均聚合支持特征，无法建模类内多样性，从而在泛化时表现脆弱。通过将原型视作可学习的分布并用扩散模型探索特征空间，可以在有限标注下生成多样且语义连贯的表征，提升鲁棒性。

Method: 方法上，DPL包含三个核心模块：1) 扩散型原型增强模块：将单一支持特征作为初始样本，经过正向扰动与反向去噪的扩散过程，学习生成多样化但语义一致的原型变体集合；2) 空间感知条件机制：利用原型特征统计量（如位置与形状相关的几何信息）条件化扩散过程，使生成样本保持空间一致性；3) 保守融合策略：在融合多变体为最终表征时，引入保守机制以保留原型的语义可信度同时增强多样性。此外，训练与推理阶段使用相同的增强与融合流水线，保证一致性，扩散过程还作为正则器参与训练。

Result: 在多个腹部MRI和CT数据集上进行广泛实验，DPL在指标上显著优于现有一-shot分割方法，分别在若干肝脏/器官分割任务上取得明显提升并刷新了SOTA。论文还展示了生成原型变体的可视化结果、消融分析（验证空间条件与保守融合的有效性）以及对扩散过程作为正则器作用的讨论。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL)通过在特征空间中引入扩散过程，将单一支持原型扩展为可学习的概率分布，从而有效缓解了一次性分割中原型表示的脆弱性问题。DPL在保留原型语义一致性的同时，生成多样化的原型变体，提升了模型对解剖变异和小样本标注噪声的鲁棒性。实验表明其在腹部MRI和CT数据集上实现了显著性能提升并建立了新的SOTA。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Motivation: 预训练状态空间模型在视频处理中通过序列压缩提高效率，但提示学习时产生的序列化提示令牌无法充分捕获帧内空间上下文与帧间时间上下文，限制了判别信息的传播与提取，进而影响下游任务性能。

Method: 提出了两大模块：Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) 用于在单帧内聚合关键空间信息；Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) 用于在帧间传播判别性时空信息。两模块结合以自适应平衡与压缩关键时空信息，嵌入到预训练状态空间模型的提示学习流程中。

Conclusion: 本文提出的State Space Prompting (SSP) 有效解决了预训练状态空间模型在视频提示学习中空间与时间信息传播不足的问题，通过帧内聚合与帧间扩散的互补机制，提升了判别信息的保留与传播，实验证明在四个基准数据集上平均提升2.76%，并减少了微调参数开销。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and

rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: 通过对齐学生与教师的视觉注意力，CompoDistill能显著提升学生模型的视觉感知和组合推理能力，同时不牺牲在视觉问答等任务上的性能，且具有良好泛化性。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Conclusion: 分层推理结合视觉-语言模型能提升事故报告的准确性与连贯性，是分析交通安全事件的可行方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DIANet：基于相位感知动态图的双流框架，将起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个阶段分别编码为动态图，使用跨注意力模块融合。对CASME-II、SAMM、MMEW三数据集验证，性能优于单相位方法。


<details>

Motivation: 微表情短暂且细微，含时序阶段特征；传统动态图把整个序列压缩成单帧，忽略不同阶段的差异，限制识别性能，因此需要显式建模时间相位。

Method: 设计相位感知动态图：分别从onset-to-apex和apex-to-offset两阶段生成动态图；双流卷积网络分别处理两路输入；引入跨注意力融合模块基于上下文相关性自适应整合两个流的特征；在三大数据集上训练与评估。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM、MMEW三数据集上，DIANet相较于单相位DI方法获得稳健提升，实验结果支持分阶段动态图与跨注意力融合的有效性。

Conclusion: 显式建模时间相位信息能提升微表情识别性能，DIANet在三个基准数据集上均超越传统单相位动态图方法，表明分阶段编码与跨注意力融合是有效策略。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对高效构建视觉-语言推理训练数据的原则理解不足，作者旨在明确哪些数据策划策略能提升VLM的推理能力，并据此构建高质量大规模CoT数据集以提升模型表现与效率。

Conclusion: 上下文来源策略、辅助信号（如图像标题）与文本推理样本以及全维度扩展（更多图、问题与CoT）都能显著增强VLM推理能力。基于此构建的HoneyBee数据集能在多种模型规模上超过现有SOTA，并通过测试时缩放策略在不损失准确性的情况下降低解码成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Parallel multi-token prediction speeds up inference but causes structural inconsistencies due to token incompatibilities and lack of backtracking; need robustness so sampled tokens can be refined.

Method: Iterative self-correction for parallel token generation

Result: Training by injecting random tokens into context improves model robustness and enables iterative token fixing during sampling, preserving efficiency while improving quality; validated on ImageNet-256, CIFAR-10, UCF-101, NuScenes with substantial improvements.

Conclusion: 该方法允许在并行生成中对已采样token进行反复修正，显著减少结构不一致性并提升生成结果，同时保持较高的推理效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Motivation: Address cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise in infrared small target detection for drone-based sensing by aligning domains and learning real noise invariance

Method: Wavelet-guided cross-domain invariance learning for infrared small target detection

Result: Two-stage framework: wavelet-guided cross-domain synthesis for background-target separation and real-domain noise invariance learning with a dynamic noise library; introduced Dynamic-ISTD benchmark; outperforms SOTA in cross-domain robustness

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD有效减轻分布偏差和真实噪声干扰，通过小波引导的样本对齐与自监督噪声不变性学习，提升了ISTD在跨域真实场景的检测性能，并提供了动态基准数据集与代码。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本工作提出以时空一致的代理节点（proxy nodes）作为视频中动态对象/场景的表示，替代易受像素级匹配与跟踪误差影响的传统方法；代理节点具层级多尺度结构与动态更新机制，可抵抗跟踪误差、遮挡与大幅运动，且形状与纹理的解耦编码便于精细可控的外观编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级匹配与跟踪作为视频表征的先验不稳定且过细，少量跟踪误差、遮挡或大幅运动就会导致对象表示崩溃，亟需更鲁棒的时空一致表示。

Method: 构建层次化代理节点以多尺度表示物体结构，设计基于视频时空先验的动态更新机制来缓解跟踪不准与长时序漂移；对每个视觉对象采用形状与纹理解耦编码，结合代理节点进行视频编码与重建。

Result: 大量实验表明该表示以更少参数实现更高的视频重建精度，并能有效支持视频修复和关键帧驱动的时序一致编辑，能处理遮挡、大运动与视角变化。

Conclusion: 提出的时空一致代理节点表示在参数更少的条件下实现了高精度的视频重建，并支持视频修复、基于关键帧的时序一致性编辑等复杂任务，表现优越且鲁棒。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

TL;DR: 提出无超参或低超参的乘法性和置信自适应乘法性损失，通过置信度调制梯度，改善小样本医学/细胞图像分割性能与稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学与细胞图像标注昂贵且数据稀缺，传统Cross Entropy与Dice的加性组合对超参敏感且在小样本下表现不稳，需要一种无超参或少超参、对置信度敏感并能稳定优化的损失函数。

Method: 将Cross Entropy与Dice Loss以乘法方式结合，使得损失对模型预测置信度敏感；在此基础上引入置信度驱动的指数缩放（受Focal Loss启发），当置信度低或Dice小时报以更大梯度，以强调困难样本。

Result: 在多个细胞和医学图像分割基准上，所提方法在小样本设置下持续优于调参后的加性损失和已有工作，提升了鲁棒性和收敛稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的乘法性损失和置信自适应乘法性损失，通过将交叉熵与Dice乘法结合并依据置信度调整梯度，能更稳健地训练分割模型，尤其在数据稀缺场景下优于常用的加性损失组合。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Motivation: 获取真实OOD数据昂贵且生成伪OOD图像训练代价高，观察到OOD图像通常与ID图像共享相似背景区域，故利用局部背景作为廉价的伪OOD信号。

Method: 基于卷积的局部不变性，从ID图像中提取背景特征作为模拟的OOD表示；在训练过程中通过最小化这些背景特征的L2范数来使网络在OOD上不那么自信；方法可与现有后处理技术组合。

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准上表现优异，与后处理方法兼容并达成新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将ID图像的局部背景特征作为伪OOD特征进行训练，有效缓解神经网络在OOD样本上的过度自信，从而提升OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Conclusion: 本文提出AngularFuse框架，通过角度感知损失和精细参考图像合成提升可见-红外图像融合效果，能同时保留纹理强度与边缘方向性，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative

*Ying A,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting(PAGS)，通过语义引导的剪枝与正则化以及优先级驱动的渲染，保留关键对象细节，简化背景，显著缩短训练时间并将渲染速度提升至350+ FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对场景中所有元素一视同仁，导致在训练/渲染时对不重要背景也分配大量资源，无法满足自动驾驶对关键对象高保真和实时性的需求。

Method: 1) 语义引导剪枝与正则化：基于混合重要性度量（语义等级、可见度、运动性、几何复杂度）对高优先级保留细节，对低优先级激进合并/剔除；2) 优先级驱动渲染：深度预通道使用优先级剔除遮挡基元并在光照计算中按优先级分层处理以减少着色代价。

Result: PAGS在动态城市场景三维重建中，通过语义优先级分配计算资源，提升关键物体（车辆、行人等）重建质量并加速训练与渲染。

Conclusion: PAGS能在Waymo和KITTI上在保证或提升关键安全对象重建质量的同时，大幅降低计算开销，适合自动驾驶场景的实时或近实时3D重建与渲染。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

TL;DR: 提出一种将大模型知识蒸馏到双分支学生网络并用动态软目标的PRVR方法，有效检索未裁剪的部分相关长视频，达到多数据集SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实中未裁剪长视频检索与文本部分相关的挑战，克服以往文本到视频检索研究假设视频已被裁剪且与文本完全相关的局限。

Method: 构建大教师与双分支学生（继承分支吸收可转移知识，探索分支学习数据集特定信息），通过动态知识蒸馏生成随训练演化的软标签，替代硬标签监督以捕捉细粒度部分相关性。

Result: 提出DL-DKD++框架，通过大规模视听语言预训练模型蒸馏知识到轻量双分支学生网络，并引入动态软目标构建机制，在TVR、ActivityNet、Charades-STA上实现PRVR任务的最先进性能。

Conclusion: DL-DKD++结合继承与探索双分支以及动态软目标，有效缓解领域差距并提升部分相关视频检索性能，兼顾模型轻量化与泛化能力。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs often hallucinate brand text in non-textual logos due to symbolic priors encoded in specific projector dimensions; targeted ablation and OCR-guided methods can reduce this failure while keeping OCR performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To diagnose and understand an overlooked hallucination type in VLMs—predicting text in logos lacking visible words—and to identify mechanisms and mitigations to improve multimodal trustworthiness.

Method: Constructed curated splits (pure symbols, hybrids, text-bearing) and Hard-60 subset; measured hallucination across leading VLMs; applied nine structured perturbations; performed embedding-level analysis using open-weight LLaVA; conducted targeted projector-dimension ablation and evaluated OCR accuracy.

Result: Hallucinations are widespread across VLMs, robust to many distortions (especially occlusion), concentrated in few projector dimensions, and reducible by targeted ablation without harming OCR, suggesting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as effective mitigations.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit a systematic failure mode—logo hallucination—where they predict textual brand content for logos without visible words; this is linked to projector subspaces and symbolic priors, but can be mitigated by projector ablation and OCR-guided decoding.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Conclusion: 两阶段方案在效率与视觉质量间取得平衡；高斯初始化和增强器训练数据的设计对最终性能有显著影响

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

TL;DR: CurriFlow fuses segmentation/visual/depth features across frames with pre-trained optical flow and uses curriculum from LiDAR to stereo depth plus SAM priors, improving SSC and achieving SOTA on SemanticKITTI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SSC methods lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision; need better temporal alignment and robust depth usage.

Method: Multi-level flow-guided fusion + curriculum depth fusion + SAM semantic priors

Result: Proposed CurriFlow integrating optical flow-based alignment, curriculum learning from LiDAR to stereo depth, and SAM priors; achieves SOTA mIoU 16.9 on SemanticKITTI.

Conclusion: Motion-guided multi-level fusion and curriculum-guided depth fusion with SAM semantic priors improve temporal consistency, geometric robustness, and semantic learning, yielding SOTA SSC performance.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种注意力引导的输入自适应动态采样模块，能在训练与推理时根据输入选择重要切片/帧，减少计算并提升分类性能，在3D医学影像和超声视频数据上取得良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在3D体数据或视频分类中存在大量冗余切片/帧，完整处理所有帧带来高计算代价。现有基于Gumbel-max的可学习采样方法只能实现任务级适配，采样策略在不同输入间不变，限制了实用性。作者希望开发一套输入自适应、推理时也能动态调整的采样机制，以降低计算开销并保持性能。

Method: 引入注意力引导的采样模块，用于替换传统不可微的子采样操作。与仅任务自适应的Gumbel-max方法不同，本方法在训练和推理时都能对每个输入动态生成采样分布，从而选择最有信息的切片/帧。该模块可与任意网络结构集成，并通过注意力机制学习输入重要性，进而进行可微或近似可微的采样决策。

Result: 在MedMNIST3D的3D医学影像数据以及两个超声视频分类数据集（包含一个采自真实临床环境的困难数据集）上，所提方法在降低计算复杂度的同时获得了性能提升，证明了输入自适应注意力采样在实际任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个可学习的子采样框架，能嵌入任意神经网络，通过注意力引导实现输入自适应的动态采样，在推理阶段也能调整采样策略，从而在保持或提升性能的同时降低计算复杂度。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: 提出双流（空间检测+时序建模）模型STORM-PSR，通过弱监督空间预训练与Transformer时序编码器，在遮挡情况下提高步骤识别，显著降低完成预测延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于帧间物体状态检测，忽视时序特征，导致在部分遮挡或视角不全时鲁棒性和准确性下降；为此提出结合时序信息的双流模型以提升PSR性能。

Method: 双流架构：1) 物体状态检测流——处理无遮挡视角；2) 时空流——弱监督预训练的空间编码器提取图像特征，随后Transformer时序编码器建模特征随时间的关系以识别完成步骤。

Result: STORM-PSR提出一种双流框架结合空间与时序特征以提高程序步骤识别在部分遮挡下的鲁棒性；通过弱监督预训练的空间编码器和基于Transformer的时序编码器，能在遮挡情况下仍推断步骤完成；在MECCANO与IndustReal数据集上分别将步骤完成预测延迟平均降低11.2%与26.1%，并发布代码与标签。

Conclusion: 时序信息对PSR性能提升至关重要，结合空间检测与时序建模能在遮挡场景下更早且更准确地识别步骤完成，STORM-PSR在基准数据集上表现优于先前方法。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统为单场景训练的SCR在训练图像提供的多视图约束不足时会退化，缺乏高层几何或场景先验导致重建不连贯。因此希望通过在概率框架中引入高层重建先验提升训练稳定性和结果质量。

Method: 作者先将SCR训练过程以概率框架重述，使得可在训练中加入先验项。提出并测试了多类先验：简单的重建深度值分布先验和基于数据训练的3D点云扩散模型先验（在大规模室内扫描数据上训练），在训练每步将预测点推向更可能的场景几何以提高其似然。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上的实验表明，加入先验后学得的场景表示更好：点云更连贯，注册（配准）率提高，相机位姿估计更准确，并带来新视图合成与相机重定位等下游任务的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该论文提出通过概率重解释对场景坐标回归（SCR）模型训练中引入高层重建先验，从而缓解因训练视图约束不足导致的退化问题。引入多种先验（从深度分布到学习到的点云先验）能在训练过程中把预测的3D点推向更合理的几何结构，从而得到更连贯的场景点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿，并提升新视图合成和相机重定位等下游任务性能。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI价格低、便携但信噪比低、诊断质量不足。需要一种轻量、可推广且无需昂贵设备的重建方法，将低场图像提升至高场级别以扩大临床可及性。

Method: 提出基于条件流匹配（CFM）的框架，通过直接回归最优速度场，学习从噪声分布到目标数据分布的连续流；区别于需迭代采样或对抗训练的生成模型，CFM一次性预测速度场并可高效重建；在LF-MRI上将低场输入映射为高场类图像以恢复诊断质量。

Result: 在LF-MRI重建任务上，CFM取得了最先进的表现，在定量指标和视觉质量上优于对比方法，同时参数量显著更少，并在训练分布内与外均表现稳健。

Conclusion: CFM在LF-MRI图像质量迁移中表现出色，能够在参数量更少的情况下实现与或优于现有方法的重建效果，且对训练内外分布数据均具有良好泛化能力，适合资源受限环境。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效保持时间连贯性与关键信息，显著提升长视频理解能力，且提供了新的评测EgoMem供未来研究使用。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升对抗样本在未知/黑盒深度伪造检测器上的迁移成功率，同时保持图像的视觉质量，使攻击更实用且难以检测。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 1为双流对抗生成（MNTD-PGD增强梯度计算以适应小扰动预算；SG-PGD在视觉显著区域施加扰动），Stage 2为基于结构相似度（SSIM）与对黑箱模型成功率的度量感知选择模块，联合优化可迁移性与不可察觉性。

Result: 在未见检测器上，MS-GAGA使误分类率比现有最先进攻击方法最高提高约27%。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过双流攻击模块与度量感知选择模块结合，实现了在黑盒深度伪造检测器上生成高可迁移性且视觉不可察觉的对抗样本。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

TL;DR: 为避免常规增强破坏图文空间对齐，提出在增强前进行文本与视觉特征早期融合并用轻量生成器将文本映射为视觉伪图像，从而在医学图像分割中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图像增强（如旋转、翻转）会破坏图文间的空间对应关系，影响文本引导分割模型的性能，因此需要一种在增强过程中保持图文空间对齐的方法。

Method: 在增强前将文本和视觉特征融合（早期融合），并设计一个轻量级生成器将文本嵌入投影到视觉空间以生成伪图像；对伪图像执行常规数据增强以保持空间一致性，然后用于分割训练。

Result: 在三个医学成像任务和四种分割框架上进行评估，方法显著优于现有方法，达到或超过SOTA；生成的伪图像可视化显示了准确的区域定位。

Conclusion: 提出的早期融合框架能够在增强前保持图文空间对齐，从而提高多模态医学图像分割的性能，实验证明在多任务和多框架上均达到了SOTA水平。

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly
available on GitHub: https://github.com/11yxk/MedSeg_EarlyFusion.

*An Zhao,Piaopiao Yu,Zhe Zhu,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双阶段3D Gaussian Splatting（BSGS）框架，从运动模糊图像重建高质量3D场景：先粗略优化相机位姿，再在固定位姿下进行全局刚体变换校正，并引入子帧梯度聚合与时空双阶段优化以防止高斯基元过密与噪声生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D Gaussian Splatting方法对相机位姿高度敏感，且在运动模糊情形下容易产生错误的高斯基元密化，从而影响重建质量；因此需要新的框架同时解决位姿误差与基元密化控制问题。

Method: 方法包含两阶段：1) 相机位姿精化阶段粗略优化相机位姿以减小运动导致的畸变；2) 在固定粗位姿下进行全局刚体变换（Global Rigid Transformation）进一步校正模糊引起的畸变。为缓解多子帧梯度冲突，设计子帧梯度聚合策略；并提出时空双阶段优化以动态调整基元密化阈值，防止模糊区域过早生成噪声高斯基元。

Result: 综合实验表明，BSGS在去模糊重建任务上优于现有最先进方法，能更好地避免噪声高斯生成并恢复更高质量的3D场景细节。

Conclusion: BSGS显著提升了从相机运动导致的模糊图像中恢复高质量3D场景的能力，通过位姿粗校正、全局刚体校正及子帧与时空双阶段优化，能抑制错误高斯密度增长并优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该文提出VAD，一种无网络、轻量级方法从无向点云计算UDF：先用Voronoi能量给点估计双向法线并对齐，再扩散并积分得到UDF。方法对闭合/开放/非流形/非定向形状鲁棒且高效稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于神经网络的方法在学习UDF时常遇到数值不稳定、计算代价高和可控性差的问题；因此作者提出一种直接从点云计算UDF的网络无关方法以提高稳定性与效率。

Method: 1) 为每个点初始化双向法线；2) 设计基于Voronoi的两个几何准则，将其编码为能量函数并求解以实现法线最佳对齐；3) 将对齐后的法线域通过扩散得到近似UDF梯度场；4) 对梯度场积分恢复UDF。全过程无网络、计算轻量。

Result: 实验表明VAD能稳定处理闭合与开放表面、复杂非流形和非定向几何体，且在计算效率和数值稳定性上优于现有神经方法。

Conclusion: VAD在无需神经网络的前提下，能够从未定向点云稳定高效地构建UDF，适用于复杂拓扑结构并具有良好的数值稳定性和计算效率。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

TL;DR: 作者提出一个简单且理论支撑的扩散模型方案，通过特征归一化和解析加权的L2 score-matching损失，直接生成运动与形状，不用额外复杂特征或后处理，实验证明在无条件人体动作生成上达到了SOTA级别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是许多现有方法为提升生成质量使用过度参数化的输入特征和辅助损失，而这些策略对扩散模型来说不应是必需的。作者希望证明简化且理论有据的处理即可使扩散模型匹配真实的人体动作分布，并去除慢速的后处理形状恢复。

Method: 方法包括使用score-based diffusion model（扩散/score匹配模型），在输入特征上进行细致的归一化处理，并对标准L2 score-matching损失引入解析推导的权重调整；模型直接输出运动和形状参数而非仅关节位置。论文逐步构建方法，并通过针对性消融实验验证各组件的有效性。

Result: 结果显示：所提出的基线扩散模型在无条件人体动作生成上达到与最先进方法相当的表现；通过消融实验展示每一项设计（特征归一化、损失加权、直接生成形状等）对性能的独立贡献。

Conclusion: 本论文结论是：通过仅使用精心设计的特征空间归一化和基于解析推导的L2 score-matching损失权重，基于score的扩散模型即可在无条件人体动作生成任务上达到与当前最先进方法相当的性能，同时直接生成运动和形状，避免了从关节慢速恢复形状的后处理步骤。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIRL-AD trains IL and RL agents competitively and interactively, enabling knowledge exchange without gradient conflict, yielding better safety and generalization on autonomous driving benchmarks


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IL generalizes poorly alone; RL explores but is sample-inefficient and unstable; combining both can leverage strengths and mitigate weaknesses

Method: Competitive dual-policy training combining imitation learning and reinforcement learning

Result: On nuScenes, CoIRL-AD reduces collision rate by 18% vs baselines, improves generalization and long-tail performance

Conclusion: Competitive interaction between IL and RL during training yields better policies than two-stage IL->RL, reducing collisions and improving long-tail scenario handling

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

TL;DR: 构建大型多光谱无人机MOT基准MMOT并提出兼容RGB预训练的多光谱方向感知跟踪方法，显著提升小目标与密集场景跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机多目标跟踪在RGB图像下受外观信息退化影响严重，尤其是小目标、遮挡和复杂背景。多光谱图像能提供光谱反射信息，提高目标可辨识性，但缺乏专用的数据集。

Method: 数据集构建（125视频、精确方向框、8类）；设计轻量Spectral 3D-Stem以融入光谱特征且兼容RGB预训练；提出方向感知卡尔曼滤波器用于精确状态估计；开发端到端方向自适应Transformer以利用方向信息进行关联和重识别。

Result: 提出MMOT首个无人机多光谱多目标跟踪基准：125段视频、488.8K标注、8类、带方向框；并提出多光谱与方向感知跟踪方案：Spectral 3D-Stem、方向感知卡尔曼滤波器、方向自适应Transformer。实验表明多光谱显著优于RGB，特别是小目标与高密度场景。

Conclusion: MMOT数据集与方法能推动无人机多光谱MOT研究，多光谱输入在复杂空中视角下大幅改善跟踪可靠性。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Motivation: Improve temporal alignment between conditioning signals and generated human motion, addressing limitations of cross-attention fusion methods.

Method: 在Mamba模块的递归动态中直接融合条件信息（而非仅用cross-attention），形成Temporally Conditional Mamba；在多种任务上进行实验评估。

Result: Temporally Conditional Mamba (TCM), which integrates conditional information into the recurrent Mamba block to produce better temporally aligned motion.

Conclusion: TCM 比现有基线在时间对齐、动作逼真性和条件一致性方面有明显改进，验证于多项人体动作任务。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出一种零样本农业图像分割方法，结合Plantnet（植物分类大模型）、其DinoV2主干以及Segment Anything Model（SAM），通过Plantnet提取的植物特征生成粗略掩码并由SAM精细化，从而避免新数据标注。实验证明在四个数据集上，使用Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基线DinoV2在IoU上有一致提升，表明将通用基础模型与植物专用模型结合可缓解标注瓶颈，在复杂田间场景中实现有效分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业场景标注困难且数据稀缺，现成的植物分类模型（Plantnet）携带丰富植物表征，可以用来零样本生成分割掩码，从而避免昂贵的人工标注并提升分割性能。

Method: 用Plantnet（包含DinoV2主干）在图像上识别植物区域，生成粗略分割掩码；再将这些掩码作为提示交给SAM进行掩码细化，形成最终分割结果。评估在四个公开农业数据集上，用IoU比较Plantnet微调DinoV2 vs 基线DinoV2。

Result: 在四个数据集上实验，Plantnet微调的DinoV2比未微调的DinoV2在Jaccard Index/IoU上均有一致性提升，表明方法有效。

Conclusion: 将Plantnet的植物特化表示与SAM结合能在无需额外标注的前提下，显著提升农业图像分割性能，尤其在数据稀缺或复杂背景下优于仅用通用主干的方案。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种无需预训练模型或额外数据的自监督层间对齐正则化方法，通过让语义丰富的中间层指导较弱层，显著提高扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，且可推广至多种模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 已有工作表明扩散模型的生成质量与其中间表示有关，外部对这些表示的引导能加速训练；LayerSync的动机是探寻能否仅用模型自身的层间表示进行内在引导，减少对外部监督的依赖。

Method: 在训练过程中添加一个轻量级的正则项，促使语义更丰富的层（强表示）对语义较弱的层（弱表示）进行对齐/指导；该正则项为插拔式且不引入训练开销或额外预训练模型。

Result: 在图像生成（如ImageNet）以及音频、视频、动作等其他域的任务上均取得一致提升；示例性结果包括对基于流的transformer在ImageNet上训练速度提升超8.75倍，生成质量提升23.6%。

Conclusion: LayerSync通过利用模型自身语义丰富的中间表示来指导弱表示，从而提升扩散模型的生成质量和训练效率，是一种无需外部模型或数据的自监督正则化方法，且可跨模态应用。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

Result: This paper presents a two-stage training framework for pixel-space diffusion and consistency generative models that closes the performance and efficiency gap with latent-space models.

Conclusion: 通过在像素空间直接训练编码器-解码器结构并端到端微调，作者在ImageNet-256/512上实现了领先的FID与采样效率，并成功在高分辨率上首次训练出高质量的一步一致性模型。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Result: 提出IVT-LR，通过潜在空间交错注入视觉和文本信息，代表推理步骤为潜在文本与潜在视觉组合，性能提升准确率5.45%且推理速度提升5倍

Conclusion: IVT-LR实现了更高效的多模态推理，在无需显式逐步标注的情况下提升准确率并大幅加快推理速度

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

TL;DR: WaterFlow integrates underwater imaging priors and temporal dimension into a rectified flow-based network, boosting USOD performance (S_m +0.072 on USOD10K).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater images suffer degradation and domain gaps; existing methods ignore physical imaging principles and miss useful degradation information

Method: flow-based framework with physical priors and temporal modeling

Result: On USOD10K, WaterFlow improves S_m by 0.072, showing effectiveness

Conclusion: Incorporating physical imaging priors and temporal modeling in a flow-based framework significantly improves underwater salient object detection.

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing zero-shot denoisers are slow and assume noise is independent and zero-mean, which fails for complex real-world noise. Authors leverage cross-frequency consistency of textures vs noise to avoid noise assumptions and speed up training.

Method: Cross-frequency consistency based zero-shot denoising with ultralight network

Result: Proposed ZSCFC: cross-frequency consistency loss + ultralight network; trains on single noisy image without noise-distribution assumptions; outperforms other zero-shot methods in both efficiency and denoising quality on real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Cross-frequency consistency is effective for distinguishing texture from noise; combined with an ultralight network it enables fast, assumption-free zero-shot denoising with superior performance.

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

*Shuhei Tarashima,Yushan Wang,Norio Tagawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 把分层视觉Transformer的早期stage当编码器，能用更少计算达到与全模型相当的HMR/HPE性能，提供更优的轻量化基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的HMR方法依赖大型非分层视觉Transformer，计算代价高且不利于资源受限场景。观察到分层VFM的中间阶段已能产出与非分层模型相当甚至更高分辨率的特征图，激发了将早期stage用于HMR/HPE以实现效率提升的想法。

Method: 构建三种基于ViTPose改造的轻量级HMR2.0变体；引入Swin、GroupMixFormer、VMamba等分层VFM的前两到前三个stage作为编码器；对27个基于分层VFM的HMR/HPE模型进行系统评估，并比较截断模型与全阶段模型及现有轻量化方案的精度-效率权衡。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用分层VFM的前两或前三个stage即可达到与使用全部stage相当的性能；截断模型在精度与计算量之间表现出更优的折衷，相比现有轻量替代方案更高效。

Conclusion: 在保持性能的同时，利用分层视觉基础模型（VFM）的早期阶段作为编码器可以显著降低计算复杂度，为HMR和HPE提供更高效的轻量化基线。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

*Julen Costa-Watanabe,Isabelle Wittmann,Benedikt Blumenstiel,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了 TerraCodec，一组为 EO 设计的学习型编码器和一个时序变换器（TEC-TT），通过 Latent Repacking 支持可变码率，在 Sentinel-2 上显著优于传统编码器，并能进行零样本云修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EO 卫星产生海量多光谱时序影像，现有图像/视频编码器要么忽视时序冗余，要么依赖不适合静态场景的运动先验；且缺乏公开的训练模型。需要为 EO 设计的学习型、可变率压缩方法。

Method: 包括多光谱适配的图像编码器变体；基于 Transformer 的时序模型（TEC-TT）用于捕获时间依赖性；提出 Latent Repacking，用于在变换器上进行可变率训练；在 Sentinel-2 数据上训练并与经典编码器和视频/图像压缩方法比较。

Result: TerraCodec (TEC) 是一套针对地球观测（EO）影像时序的学习型压缩算法，包括适配多光谱输入的图像变体和基于变换器的时序模型（TEC-TT）。提出了 "潜在重打包（Latent Repacking）" 方法，使变换器模型支持可变率训练。结果显示在 Sentinel-2 数据上，相比传统编码器在同等质量下实现 3-10 倍更强压缩，并且 TEC-TT 在零样本云遮挡修复(AllClear基准)上超越 SOTA。作者将开源代码和权重。

Conclusion: 学习型、为 EO 专门设计的压缩方法能显著提升多光谱时序数据的压缩率，同时时序变换器还能提供下游任务（如云修复）的零样本能力，表明此方向具备广泛潜力。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种面向多无人机的协同占据预测框架，保留3D语义与结构并通过高度感知压缩与双掩码机制显著减少通信，实现了更高精度与更低通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于BEV的方法在用边界框表示场景时无法完整表达语义和几何信息，且在未定义或被遮挡物体场景下性能下降，因此需要一种能更完整表达场景且通信高效的协同占据预测方法。

Method: 方法包括：1) 空间感知特征编码器（Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder）用于保持3D空间结构与语义；2) 跨智能体特征整合（Cross-Agent Feature Integration）用于融合多无人机信息；3) 高度感知特征压缩（Altitude-Aware Feature Reduction）用于降维与高效表示场景信息；4) 双掩码感知引导（Dual-Mask Perceptual Guidance）用于自适应选择传输特征并减少通信量。

Result: 通过扩展并构建两个虚拟数据集（Air-to-Pred-Occ, UAV3D-Occ）和一个真实数据集（GauUScene-Occ），实验证明所提方法在准确性上显著优于现有协同方法，同时将通信开销降至过去方法的一小部分，达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种用于多无人机协同占据预测的新框架，通过保留三维空间结构与语义信息，提升协同感知的准确性与鲁棒性，且在通信开销方面有显著优势。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EReLiFM：针对带噪标签的开放集域泛化，采用无监督两阶段证据损失聚类识别可靠样本，并引入残差流匹配建模结构化域与类别条件残差以实现不依赖插值的多样化不确定性传递，元学习更新方向在干净集上最大化对噪声集损失的下降，使用最可信预测类的伪标签监督，实验表明优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是解决OSDG在源域标签噪声下性能下降的问题：噪声标签损害已学知识，影响已知类识别和未知类拒绝；现有超曲率原型引导元学习方法难以跨域差异，且在干净数据有限时效果受限，因此需要同时增强标签可靠性识别和域间传递机制。

Method: 方法包含：1) 无监督两阶段基于证据损失的聚类，用于估计样本标签可靠性并划分为清洁/噪声集；2) 残差流匹配机制，建模域与类别条件的结构化残差，提供多样化且不确定性感知的传输路径，而非简单插值增强；3) 元学习目标：在干净集上更新方向应最大化对噪声集损失的降低，使用最自信预测类作为噪声伪标签进行监督。

Result: 在公开基准上，EReLiFM相较于先前方法表现更好，达成新的SOTA；源码已开源。

Conclusion: EReLiFM在OSDG-NL任务上取得SOTA，能更好识别已知类并拒绝未知类，通过证据感知的可靠样本识别和残差流匹配实现鲁棒、可迁移的特征传递，提高面对标签噪声与域差异的泛化能力。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H-EGL: a hybrid framework merging self-supervised class-distinctive attention and human-guided constraints to improve ViT chest X-ray classification, generalization, and attention alignment, outperforming prior EGL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based models excel in medical imaging but learn spurious correlations, causing biases and poor generalization; human-AI attention alignment helps but needs expensive manual supervision. The paper aims to reduce dependence on manual guidance by combining self-supervised and human-guided attention constraints.

Method: H-EGL integrates a self-supervised module that enforces class-distinctive attention (without restrictive priors) with a human-guided attention constraint; trained on ViT for chest X-ray classification and compared against two EGL baselines; evaluation includes classification accuracy, generalization tests, and attention alignment metrics.

Result: Proposed H-EGL framework combining self-supervised class-distinctive attention with limited human-guided constraints; validated on chest X-ray classification with ViT, outperforming two state-of-the-art EGL methods in accuracy, generalization, and producing attention maps better aligned with human expertise.

Conclusion: H-EGL effectively balances self-supervision and human guidance to reduce spurious correlations, enhance generalization, and yield attention maps more aligned with clinicians, outperforming existing EGL approaches on chest X-ray tasks.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

TL;DR: IRIS是首个评估MLLM“think with images”能力的基准，包含1,204项任务与评分细则，揭示现有模型在图像操控与工具整合方面的显著短板。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中用户提供的图像常有缺陷，解决复杂视觉-文本任务需要模型主动进行图像裁剪、编辑或增强并与工具交互；现有基准仍停留在将图像视为静态输入，不能衡量此类能力。

Method: 构建包含1,204个开放式视觉任务的数据集（603单回合，601多回合），覆盖五个领域，并配套详尽评分细则；对多种主流MLLMs进行评测，分析模型在图像操作与工具整合上的表现与差异。

Result: 当前主流MLLM在需要图像操控与工具整合的任务上表现较差，最佳模型（GPT-5-think）仅达18.68%通过率；OpenAI模型在利用多样图像操作上获益明显，而Gemini-2.5-pro无显著提升。

Conclusion: IRIS提出将视觉从被动输入转为可操作的认知工作区，填补现有基准在“think with images”范式下的评估空白。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种个性化联邦微调方法，通过学习正交的LoRA适配器将通用与客户端特定知识解耦，在医疗影像联邦任务上表现与现有方法相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域数据稀缺且受隐私限制，尽管大模型减少了标注需求，但仍需针对下游任务微调；联邦学习可在不集中数据的前提下共享知识，但需要方法兼顾全局泛化与客户端个性化。

Method: 基于LoRA低秩适配器构建两套参数：一套学习全局共享的低秩子空间，另一套学习客户端特有的低秩子空间，并通过正交约束（或正交化操作）使二者互不干扰；在联邦训练中同步或聚合全局适配器参数，保留并更新本地适配器用于个性化微调。

Result: 在真实世界的联邦医学影像任务上的初步实验表明，该方法与现有联邦微调技术相比具有竞争性，具体指标未给出，但展示了有效性和实用潜力。

Conclusion: 所提方法能在保护隐私的联邦设置下，利用正交LoRA适配器有效分离全局与本地知识，使每个客户端同时受益于自身与他人数据，初步实验在真实医疗影像任务上性能具有竞争力。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将扩散模型应用于实际世界的视频超分辨率，克服高延迟、高计算成本以及对超高分辨率泛化差的问题，使扩散式VSR具备效率、可扩展性和实时性能。

Method: 三项关键创新：1) 训练友好的三阶段蒸馏管线以支持流式超分辨率；2) 本地约束稀疏注意力用于剪除冗余计算并弥合训练-测试分辨率差距；3) 小型条件解码器加速重建同时保持质量。

Result: 提出FlashVSR：首个扩散驱动的一步流式实时VSR框架，结合三阶段蒸馏管线、本地约束稀疏注意力和小型条件解码器，在A100上对768x1408视频实现约17 FPS，构建VSR-120K数据集，达到在超高分辨率下的SOTA性能并比此前模型快最多12倍。

Conclusion: FlashVSR在效率、可扩展性和性能上显著推进了扩散模型在实际视频超分辨率中的可用性，适合超高分辨率实时应用，并将公开代码和数据集推动后续研究。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

TL;DR: SPORTS将VPS、VO、SR迭代整合：注意力几何融合与后匹配提升跨帧分割与跟踪，利用分割增强动态置信估计改进位姿与深度，点基向神经场渲染实现高保真视图合成，实验验证全面优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、传感器数据稀疏和视角限制方面表现不足，需设计一个能协同三项任务、互相促进的统一框架以提升感知、定位与渲染的整体性能。

Method: 在VPS模块，引入自适应注意力几何融合机制，利用位姿、深度和光流对齐跨帧特征并为不同解码阶段自动调整特征图；采用后匹配策略提升实例跟踪一致性。在VO模块，结合VPS的全景分割结果与光流来估计动态物体置信度，从而在学习范式下提升相机位姿估计和深度图完整性。SR模块利用点云转神经场的点基渲染，将稀疏点云合成为高保真RGB视图和双胞全景视图，VO输出辅助提高渲染质量。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的大量实验表明，所提注意力融合方法在里程计、跟踪、分割和新视角合成任务上均优于多数现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该文提出SPORTS框架，通过将Video Panoptic Segmentation、Visual Odometry和Scene Rendering三项任务紧密整合为迭代统一流程，实现更完整的场景理解与重建。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

TL;DR: VQArt-Bench is a new art-focused VQA benchmark generated by a multi-agent pipeline to test deep visual-semantic reasoning; evaluations show major shortcomings in current MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VQA benchmarks focus on surface-level attributes and simple syntactic questions, enabling shortcut exploitation and failing to assess deep visual-semantic understanding needed for complex domains like art.

Method: Proposed a novel multi-agent pipeline to generate and validate linguistically diverse, semantically rich VQA items; structured benchmark along visual understanding dimensions relevant to art analysis.

Result: Built a large-scale VQArt-Bench probing symbolism, narrative, and complex relationships; evaluated 14 MLLMs and found widespread limitations, especially in counting and reasoning; proprietary models outperform open-source ones.

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench demonstrates that current MLLMs lack deep semantic and visual reasoning abilities in cultural heritage imagery, revealing specific weaknesses like counting and a gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

TL;DR: E-MoFlow通过隐式时空和几何正则化，无监督联合优化自运动与光流，摆脱显式深度、在无监督方法中表现领先并接近监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机缺乏强鲁棒的数据关联，单独估计光流或自运动在无监督下病态。通过联合估计并引入隐式时空和几何先验，可以解除病态，提高对齐与泛化能力。

Method: 用连续样条参数化相机6-DoF运动，用隐式神经场表达像素/事件光流，设计基于微分几何的约束项（如基于流与运动的一致性）来替代显式深度，整体通过重投影/事件对齐损失在无监督下联合优化。

Result: 提出一种无监督框架E-MoFlow，联合估计事件相机的6-DoF摄像机运动与光流，使用连续样条表示相机运动、隐式神经表示光流，并通过微分几何约束引入结构与运动先验，从而避免显式深度估计。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow在无需监督的情况下，通过隐式表示与几何约束实现稳健一致的自运动与光流估计，兼顾精度与泛化性，适用于一般6-DoF场景。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

Method: 在监督学习框架下，利用带有金标准HMT运动测量的动态PET扫描数据训练网络。模型设计包含交叉注意力模块以增强不同时间帧或模态间的信息交互，从而提高运动估计精度。评估使用两台PET扫描仪（HRRT和mCT）和四种示踪剂（18F-FDG、18F-FPEB、11C-UCB-J、11C-LSN3172176），并与现有数据驱动的运动估计方法比较。

Result: DL-HMC++在定量和定性评估中均优于现有数据驱动方法，生成的去运动图像与金标准HMT难以区分。ROI标准摄取值（SUV）分析显示DL-HMC++与金标准HMT的平均差异比率：HRRT为1.2±0.5%，mCT为0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习并引入交叉注意力机制的PET头部运动校正方法（DL-HMC++），能够直接从一秒钟的3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，达到与外部硬件运动追踪（HMT）相当的效果。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnyUp: an inference-time, feature-agnostic upsampler that sets new SOTA, generalizes across encoders, preserves semantics, and is efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learned upsamplers require retraining per feature extractor (e.g., DINO, CLIP), limiting generalization. Need a method that can upsample any vision feature at any resolution without encoder-specific training.

Method: Design an upsampling architecture that operates at inference-time without encoder-specific training, likely using learnable modules or adaptive interpolation conditioned on features to preserve semantics and resolution-agnostic behavior.

Result: AnyUp achieves state-of-the-art quality for upsampled features, generalizes across different feature types, preserves semantics, and is efficient and easy to apply to many downstream tasks.

Conclusion: AnyUp provides a general, inference-time, feature-agnostic upsampling method that outperforms prior upsamplers and preserves semantics across feature types.

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

Method: 为每个高斯估计时间依赖的不确定性，基于不确定性构建节点和边的时空图，利用不确定性加权传播可靠运动信息以约束和优化高斯的运动与属性，从而在重建和渲染上获得改进

Result: 提出USplat4D：基于不确定性的动态高斯点撒（Gaussian Splatting）框架，通过估计逐时变高斯不确定性并构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，提升在遮挡与极端视角下的几何稳定性和渲染质量

Conclusion: 显式建模逐时变不确定性并用于时空图优化，能稳定动态高斯点撒在遮挡及视图外推场景中的运动估计和渲染表现

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

TL;DR: FPT models multi-modal local motion conditioned on sparse interactions, providing interpretable distributions and strong performance across tasks like face motion, articulated object motion, and moving part segmentation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need interpretable multi-modal motion distributions responsive to local interactions ('pokes'), overcoming single-realization dense sampling and enabling uncertainty-aware, action-conditioned prediction

Method: Flow Poke Transformer (FPT): predicts distribution of local motion conditioned on sparse pokes using transformer-based flow representation

Result: FPT yields directly accessible motion distributions; outperforms specialized baselines on dense face motion generation; fine-tuning improves articulated object motion estimation in synthetic OOD tasks; competitive on moving part segmentation from pokes

Conclusion: FPT is a versatile framework for predicting explicit, interaction-conditioned motion distributions, improving performance and interpretability across diverse downstream tasks

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SRUM，一种对齐统一多模态模型（UMMs）自我提升的后训练框架，通过让模型的理解模块作为内部评估器，对生成模块进行全局-局部双重奖励反馈，从而在无需人工标注的情况下提升图像生成质量与语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有UMMs中理解能力强但生成能力不足的现象，提出能否利用模型自身理解模块对生成模块进行无监督指导以实现自我提升的问题，并设计框架解决之。

Method: SRUM在原始UMMs基础上加入自我奖励机制：生成模块基于文本提示生成图像；理解模块评估生成结果并输出全球（语义、布局）与局部（对象细节）两级奖励；利用这些无监督奖励信号对生成器进行后训练优化，从而闭环自我改进。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench上从82.18提升到88.37，在T2I-ReasonBench上从43.82提升到46.75，显示出显著性能改进和良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: SRUM通过构建理解—生成的自我奖励闭环，利用全局语义与局部对象级别双重奖励，对现有UMMs进行后训练，显著提升了文本到图像生成在语义一致性和细节保真度上的表现，在多个基准上取得明显提升，证明了用理解模块指导生成模块的可行性与有效性。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

Conclusion: MVP4D在图像质量、时间一致性和3D一致性方面优于既有方法，降低了创建可动画数码人像的门槛，并实现实时渲染。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成模型仍依赖独立的图像和文本编码器，限制跨模态推理与知识迁移。训练大型统一生成模型代价高且需大量数据，故提出基于冻结VLM的轻量化统一编码方案以实现跨模态能力与可编辑性。

Method: 核心方法为Layerwise Attention Pooling（LAP）：对冻结VLM的多层文本与视觉token做层间注意力池化以提取高层语义和低层细节，作为扩散模型（DiT）的条件。引入VERIFI：在模型内提示重写时仅使用VLM生成的文本tokens对DiT进行条件化，结合对齐分布与VLM推理以增强灵活性。对编辑任务进行微调以强化对齐和迁移能力。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐和视觉信息传递（关键于图像编辑）上优于其他浅层融合架构；VERIFI提高了编辑能力与推理灵活性；单图编辑微调后实现对多图参考的零样本泛化，证明统一编码器设计有效。

Conclusion: UniFusion展示了用冻结VLM作为统一编码器，配合LAP和VERIFI，可以在保持VLM推理能力的同时实现更好的文本-图像对齐与视觉信息迁移，且在编辑任务上表现出显著泛化能力，支持从单图编辑训练到多图参考的零样本泛化。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCO trains MLLMs to represent images at multiple semantic-aware compression levels via several MLP connectors and KL consistency; a router selects compression per patch at inference, cutting vision tokens up to 50% with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce inference cost of MLLMs caused by many vision tokens from images by adapting token count to image semantic complexity rather than image resolution.

Method: Introduce multiple MLP connectors with varying downsampling/compression ratios; during training, apply KL divergence losses to align model responses across connectors; at inference, use a Visual Resolution Router to choose compression per patch.

Result: The paper proposes Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO) to reduce inference costs in MLLMs by using multiple MLP connectors with different compression ratios and a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) to select compression per image patch; training minimizes KL divergence among responses to different connectors; achieves up to 50% vision token reduction while preserving perception, reasoning, OCR.

Conclusion: ViCO enables dynamic, semantic-complexity-aware vision token compression in MLLMs, significantly reducing token counts without degrading key capabilities, and can be integrated into future efficient MLLMs.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

TL;DR: CuMPerLay is a differentiable vectorization layer enabling cubical multiparameter persistence in deep networks via decomposing multifiltrations into learnable single-parameter persistences, with stability guarantees and empirical gains on classification/segmentation


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP offers powerful topological representation for images but is hard to integrate due to multifiltration complexity and vectorization challenges

Method: Introduce differentiable cubical multiparameter persistence layer for deep learning

Result: Proposed CuMPerLay: decomposes CMP into learnable single-parameter persistences, joint learning of bifiltration functions, differentiable vectorization, theoretical stability under generalized Wasserstein metrics, improved performance on medical imaging and vision benchmarks especially with limited data

Conclusion: CuMPerLay effectively integrates global topological features into deep models, improving performance particularly in low-data regimes, and provides stability-theoretic foundations for its vectorization approach.

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型受限于“监督缺失”，即高容量模型仅由稀疏低维动作监督，导致表示能力未被充分利用。通过预测未来图像的世界建模，可产生密集自监督信号，促使模型学习环境动力学。

Method: 提出DriveVLA-W0训练范式：对离散视觉token的VLA使用自回归世界模型，对连续视觉特征的VLA使用扩散世界模型；训练后加入轻量级动作专家以降低推理延迟，适合实时部署。

Conclusion: DriveVLA-W0通过在视觉-语言-动作模型训练中引入世界建模（预测未来图像）的自监督任务，有效缓解了监督信号稀疏的问题，从而提升了模型对驾驶环境动力学的理解与泛化能力。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between MLLMs and coordinate regression detectors, addressing low recall, duplicates, and coordinate misalignment by improving token efficiency, data quality, and training objectives to predict accurate bounding boxes.

Method: Key methods are: 1) quantize coordinates into tokens (0–999) and use special tokens for boxes; 2) build multiple data engines to generate grounding/referring/pointing datasets; 3) two-stage training: supervised fine-tuning on 22M samples followed by GRPO-based reinforcement with geometry-aware rewards to refine continuous box accuracy and reduce duplicates.

Result: On COCO and LVIS Rex-Omni matches or exceeds regression-based models like DINO and Grounding DINO in zero-shot. It also supports referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR, and key-pointing, evaluated on dedicated benchmarks.

Conclusion: Rex-Omni is a 3B MLLM that achieves SOTA object perception rivaling regression-based detectors in zero-shot by using tokenized coordinates, multi-source synthetic and real data, and a two-stage training including RL post-training.

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to unify fragmented components in AI-powered data analysis—databases, analysis libraries, tuning services—into a single adaptive, extensible system that meets evolving accuracy, latency, and cost goals.

Method: Paper analysis

Result: Aixel: four-layer architecture (application, task, model, data) with declarative task interface, optimizer for goals, model versioning and adaptive updates, unified data management, reuse and caching improving efficiency.

Conclusion: Aixel通过四层设计解决了多源异构数据、动态目标及预算变化带来的系统碎片化问题，提供可复用、可扩展的执行与管理机制，提升AI数据分析的整体性能与用户体验。

Abstract: A growing trend in modern data analysis is the integration of data management
with learning, guided by accuracy, latency, and cost requirements. In practice,
applications draw data of different formats from many sources. In the
meanwhile, the objectives and budgets change over time. Existing systems handle
these applications across databases, analysis libraries, and tuning services.
Such fragmentation leads to complex user interaction, limited adaptability,
suboptimal performance, and poor extensibility across components. To address
these challenges, we present Aixel, a unified, adaptive, and extensible system
for AI-powered data analysis. The system organizes work across four layers:
application, task, model, and data. The task layer provides a declarative
interface to capture user intent, which is parsed into an executable operator
plan. An optimizer compiles and schedules this plan to meet specified goals in
accuracy, latency, and cost. The task layer coordinates the execution of data
and model operators, with built-in support for reuse and caching to improve
efficiency. The model layer offers versioned storage for index, metadata,
tensors, and model artifacts. It supports adaptive construction, task-aligned
drift detection, and safe updates that reuse shared components. The data layer
provides unified data management capabilities, including indexing,
constraint-aware discovery, task-aligned selection, and comprehensive feature
management. With the above designed layers, Aixel delivers a user friendly,
adaptive, efficient, and extensible system.
