Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出并比较了仿真训练的神经网络与无需训练的模板匹配两种范式，结果表明在真实水下声纳点云中模板匹配更鲁棒，揭示了深度学习在数据稀缺水下场景中的局限性，并提供了首个训练自由检测基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下三维检测受限于恶劣声学环境和标注数据稀缺；获取真实标注声纳数据极其昂贵且受环境限制。论文探讨是否可在无真实训练数据下实现可靠的水下三维目标检测。

Method: 提出双路径方案：1) 物理驱动的声纳仿真流水线，用于生成合成训练数据并训练最先进的神经网络检测器；2) 基于几何先验的模板匹配系统，作为无需训练的模型化检测器。二者在相同基准上进行比较评估。

Result: 在波罗的海真实海底探测数据上：用合成数据训练的神经网络在仿真场景上达到了98% mAP，但在真实声纳数据上降至40% mAP，显示显著域偏移；而模板匹配方法在真实数据上达到83% mAP，无需任何训练，且对噪声和环境变化表现出高度鲁棒性。作者同时发布了首个大规模训练自由水下三维检测基准。

Conclusion: 基于模板匹配的训练自由方法在真实声纳点云上显示出优越的鲁棒性，而基于模拟数据训练的神经网络尽管在仿真中表现优秀，但受域偏移影响在真实数据上性能大幅下降。总体结论是：在数据稀缺的水下三维检测场景，训练自由的模型驱动方法比纯数据驱动方法更可靠。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出 MobileDenseAttn：融合 MobileNetV2 与 DenseNet201 的高效可解释模型，在 6,020 张增强 MRI 上达成 ≈98.35% 测试准确率并提供 GradCAM 可解释性，对比基线提升准确率并降低训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手工分析脑部 MRI 耗时且易出错；现有自动方法在异质肿瘤泛化性、计算效率、可解释性和透明性方面存在不足，限制了临床信任与应用。

Method: 提出双流融合模型 MobileDenseAttn：并行使用 MobileNetV2 与 DenseNet201 提取特征，采用特征级融合策略并在增强后的 6,020 张 MRI 数据集上训练。使用 GradCAM 生成热图以提高可解释性，并在严格的五折交叉验证下评估性能。

Result: 五折交叉验证下训练准确率 99.75%，测试准确率 98.35%，F1=0.9835（95% CI:0.9743–0.9920）；与基线模型（VGG19、DenseNet201、MobileNetV2）相比，准确率提高约 3.67%，训练时间较 VGG19 缩短 39.3%；GradCAM 热图能定位病灶区域。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn 是一种高效且可解释的脑肿瘤 MRI 分类模型，融合 MobileNetV2 与 DenseNet201，通过特征级融合和 GradCAM 可视化，在保持计算效率的同时提升分类性能，有望成为临床实用工具。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM在把实体知识与其图像表示对接时存在明显弱点，但这些失败有可检测的内部表征，利用探针可高精度发现失败并在部署中带来可量化的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是揭示并量化VLM在多模态接地（multimodal grounding）方面的系统性不足——即模型能用文本触发已知事实，但对等价的视觉触发效果大幅下降——并寻找可行的检测与缓解方法。

Method: 作者通过受控实验比较文本引用与视觉引用两种条件下VLM的事实回忆能力，分析模型内部状态以寻找与失败相关的模式，并训练探针在不重训练模型的前提下检测将要失败的案例，随后将探针用于视觉问答任务的选择性预测以评估实际改进效果。

Result: 核心结果包括：用图像引用时回忆事实能力约减半；在模型内部状态上训练的探针能够以超过92%的准确率识别出不可靠回答；将该探针用于视觉问答的选择性预测可使覆盖率提升7.87个百分点，同时将错误风险降低0.9个百分点。

Conclusion: 该论文的结论是：视觉语言模型（VLM）在将内部实体知识与该实体的图像表示连接时存在系统性缺陷——在仅提供视觉引用的情况下，模型回忆事实知识的能力显著下降；且这种失败在模型内部状态中有可检测的模式，利用探针可以高精度标记不可靠回答，并在选择性预测中带来实际收益。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过在隐式重建中引入patch级语义联合优化及几何原语正则化，论文在稀疏视图重建上大幅降低Chamfer误差，并能作为插件提升多种基线性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏图像输入下特征匹配差导致辐射不确定性和形状模糊，使用语义信息提供额外约束以消解模糊并恢复更精确的几何。

Method: 在NeRF/NeuS类的隐式场上额外预测并优化patch-based语义logits，联合训练SDF和辐射场；同时利用几何原语掩模作为约束项对形状模糊进行正则化；可作为插件应用于多种重建基线。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，作为专门方法，平均Chamfer距离相比SparseNeuS下降44%，相比VolRecon下降20%；作为插件加入到NeuS和Neuralangelo时平均误差分别下降69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该论文提出将patch级语义logits与隐式神经表征（SDF与辐射场）联合优化，并引入基于几何原语掩模的正则化，从而在稀疏视图条件下显著提升三维重建精度。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用AerialWaste多源影像数据，轻量级卷积网络与模型集成能有效检测非法垃圾填埋地，最终在二分类任务上达约92%级别的综合指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋地对人类和環境构成威胁，但人工定位困难且公开高质量数据稀缺。AerialWaste数据集提供了可用于大规模研究的多源航拍/卫星影像，促使使用深度学习自动识别填埋地。

Method: 作者在AerialWaste数据集上训练并比较了多种轻量级深度学习模型（包括MobileNetV2、GoogleNet、DenseNet、MobileViT等），避免使用复杂大型模型以减少过拟合。选取表现最好的模型并通过集成与融合技术构建最终分类器。

Conclusion: 本文表明，在AerialWaste数据集上，轻量级卷积神经网络结合集成与融合技术可以在非法垃圾填埋地的二分类任务上取得较高性能，作者最终得到约92.3%准确率和相近的精度/召回/F1/特异度。

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [6] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU fuses modality-specific structure and cross-modal semantic anchor with contrastive learning to improve MSA performance and interpretability


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing fusion ignores modality-specific structures and cross-modal misalignment; need to capture intra-modal relations and harmonize semantics

Method: Graph-based multimodal fusion with semantic anchors

Result: SSU builds modality-specific graphs using linguistic syntax and text-guided attention for other modalities; introduces semantic anchor from text; uses multiview contrastive learning; achieves SOTA on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI with lower compute and better interpretability

Conclusion: Integrating structural dependencies and a textual semantic anchor plus multiview contrastive loss yields better, faster, and more interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FastAvatar：一种基于模板残差预测的前向3DGS人脸生成框架，在<10ms内从单张任意姿态人脸生成高质量3DGS模型，兼顾速度、质量与编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量3DGS面部重建方法要么依赖昂贵的逐人优化（慢），要么前向方法质量不足。目标是在保持实时性或近实时性的同时提升重建质量并支持可控编辑。

Method: 构建一个基于多视图数据训练的3DGS面部模板；设计一个编码器-解码器网络，将输入图像编码为身份特定且姿态不变的潜在向量；解码器预测模板中每个高斯的结构和外观参数残差，从而通过前向残差推断快速生成个体化3DGS模型。

Result: FastAvatar在重建质量上显著优于已有前向方法（如GAGAvatar），并比逐人优化方法（如FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars, GASP）快约1000倍；同时提供了基于潜在空间的实时身份插值与属性编辑功能。

Conclusion: FastAvatar通过在单张任意姿态人脸图像上进行一次前向推断，能在极短时间内（<10ms）生成高质量的3D Gaussian Splatting（3DGS）面部模型，实现了速度与重建质量的兼顾，并支持实时身份插值与属性编辑。

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

### [8] [Securing Face and Fingerprint Templates in Humanitarian Biometric Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18415)
*Giuseppe Stragapede,Sam Merrick,Vedrana Krivokuća Hahn,Justin Sukaitis,Vincent Graf Narbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对人道主义与紧急场景中的生物识别数据风险，提出并实现了适用于移动端的生物识别模板保护（BTP）系统。通过需求分析与BTP方法比较，选择PolyProtect（针对人脸神经网络嵌入）并结合轻量级特征提取器EdgeFace，在真实埃塞俄比亚人道项目数据上评估人脸验证/识别性能及不可逆性与不可链接性，并扩展到指纹模态，首次在识别场景和指纹上评估PolyProtect，结果令人鼓舞，计划开源代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人道主义与紧急情境中生物识别可提高工作效率，但数据主体脆弱性导致隐私和安全风险需特别解决，因此需要轻量、模块化且有效的BTP方案来保护移动端部署中的生物识别数据。

Method: 对场景需求（功能、运行、安全与隐私）进行形式化；广泛比较现有BTP方法并选定PolyProtect；使用EdgeFace提取人脸嵌入，在埃塞俄比亚真实数据集上评估PolyProtect的识别/验证准确率、不可逆性与不可链接性；并将方法扩展并评估于指纹嵌入。

Result: 在真实场景数据上，PolyProtect与EdgeFace结合后表现出较高的验证与识别准确率，同时在不可逆性与不可链接性测试中达到令人接受的水平；该方法也在指纹模态上首次展示适用性，整体计算开销低，适合移动部署，将开源代码。

Conclusion: PolyProtect在保持识别/验证性能的同时，对人脸与指纹嵌入提供了可接受的不可逆性和不可链接性，适合资源受限和高风险的人道主义移动部署，且与EdgeFace配合计算负担较轻。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [9] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文主张将显式关系推理接口（动态关系图）整合到视觉基础模型（FMs）中，以提升需要实体、角色及时空关系推理任务的能力。作者通过人类操作动作识别和脑肿瘤分割两项跨域证据，展示在轻量、上下文自适应的图推理模块辅助下，模型在语义精细度、泛化性、可解释性和资源效率上优于仅使用FM的基线。并提出未来研究方向：学习式动态图构建、多层级关系推理、跨模态融合与专门的评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型尽管具备强迁移性，但在需要明确实体、角色与时空关系推理的细粒度任务上表现不足，因而需要显式的关系建模接口来补强。

Method: 通过在基础模型上外挂轻量、上下文感知的图推理模块（节点代表语义实体，边表示语义/时空关系），并在两个应用场景（人类操作动作识别与医疗影像分割）中进行实验对比，评估语义保真、OOD鲁棒性、解释性与计算/内存效率的提升。

Result: 在所示跨域实例中，FM+动态关系图的混合模型在细粒度语义准确率、OOD泛化、可解释性（可视化节点/边）和内存/计算效率上均优于纯FM基线，同时实现更高的部署可行性。

Conclusion: 将动态关系图作为显式关系接口加入视觉基础模型，可显著改善结构化视觉任务中的关系能力、稀疏推理效率和可解释性，且在资源受限场景下更易部署。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

*Lucas Wojcik,Gabriel E. Lima,Valfride Nascimento,Eduil Nascimento Jr.,Rayson Laroca,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提供了首个大规模细粒度车牌可读性分类数据集并证明任务具有挑战性，为按需图像增强与后续研究提供基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动车牌识别在低质量/不可读车牌上性能严重下降，且对所有图像统一使用预处理（如SR）代价高昂。提出按需预处理需首先判定哪些图像需要增强，因此需要带细粒度可读性标签的数据集并评估基线模型。

Method: 构建含10210张车辆图像、12687个车牌标注的数据集，采用细粒度标注（车牌/车辆遮挡、四档可读性、三个可识别档次的字符标签），并用ViT、ResNet、YOLO三种网络作为可读性分类基线以判断是否需SR或不可恢复。

Result: 公开了LPLC数据集并给出基线实验：三种网络的总体F1均低于80%，表明分类难度大，同时对SR与识别方法的分析显示现有方法在此场景下尚不足以稳定提升识别性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个有价值且细致标注的LP可读性分类数据集(LPLC)，并通过基线实验证明了任务难度，强调了需要专门方法来有条件地应用超分辨率以提高识别效率。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

*Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Ismam Nur Swapnil,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出结合轻量专家分类器与压缩对话VLM、辅以知识图检索的CLARIFY框架，实现在皮肤科VQA上更高准确性和更低计算资源需求，具临床可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用VLM在医疗专业任务上存在专精性不足且模型体量大导致临床部署成本高，需兼顾准确性、可信度与资源效率。

Method: 设计了Specialist-Generalist框架：Specialist提供快速准确的诊断预测并引导Generalist，Generalist基于知识图检索模块生成有事实支撑的自然语言解释；通过层次化设计实现误诊减少与效率提升。

Result: 在作者构建的多模态皮肤科数据集上，CLARIFY比最强基线（微调、未压缩的单模型VLM）诊断准确率提高18%，同时平均显存需求和延迟分别至少降低20%和5%。

Conclusion: CLARIFY通过Specialist（轻量化领域分类器）和Generalist（压缩会话VLM）协同，实现了在皮肤病VQA任务上提升诊断准确性、降低计算开销与延迟的目标。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a

TL;DR: 本工作组织了ICCV 2025 VQualA面部图像质量评估挑战，目标是设计轻量（≤0.5 GFLOPs，≤5M参数）模型预测人类主观评分（MOS），数据为真实退化的任意分辨率人脸图像。共有127名参赛者、1519次提交，评估基于相关性指标。报告总结了方法与发现，推动实用FIQA方法发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中噪声、模糊、压缩等退化严重影响人脸图像质量与下游任务性能，现有FIQA多关注识别驱动或计算量高的模型，缺乏面向轻量级、实际部署环境的主观质量预测方案，因此发起该挑战以促进高效、有效的MOS预测方法。

Method: 参赛团队主要采用轻量级卷积与Transformer混合骨干（MobileNet系列、EfficientNet-lite、TinyViT等），结合多尺度特征融合、通道/空间注意力模块、面部对齐或关键点引导特征提取，以及蒸馏、排序损失和感知损失等监督策略。输入预处理包括人脸检测/裁剪与多分辨率训练，测试时采用模型融合或TTA。

Result: 挑战吸引了127参赛者和1519次提交，顶尖方法在相关性指标上表现优异（显著优于基线），证明在资源受限条件下仍能获得高质量MOS预测。分析揭示多尺度融合、注意力机制、知识蒸馏与合成+真实数据混合训练对性能提升贡献最大。

Conclusion: 通过挑战验证了在严格复杂度限制下也可构建有效的FIQA模型；融合轻量级骨干、多尺度/注意力机制和感知对齐的训练策略能显著提升MOS预测性能。数据多样性与评估协议对模型泛化至关重要，并指出未来需在跨偏差鲁棒性和实际部署效率上进一步研究。

Abstract: Face images play a crucial role in numerous applications; however, real-world
conditions frequently introduce degradations such as noise, blur, and

and 5 million parameters) for the prediction of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) on
face images with arbitrary resolutions and realistic degradations. Submissions
underwent comprehensive evaluations through correlation metrics on a dataset of
in-the-wild face images. This challenge attracted 127 participants, with 1519

*Md. Rashid Shahriar Khan,Md. Abrar Hasan,Mohammod Tareq Aziz Justice*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 文中提出将TimeSformer+DPC与CLIP语义流联合训练并通过上下文门控融合，用以实现零样本监控异常检测，侧重时序与语义的协同泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中异常事件不可预测且强依赖语境，异常样本稀缺或不可用，因而需要一种能泛化到未见行为的零样本检测方法，结合时间预测与语义理解可弥补仅用单一模态的局限。

Method: 混合架构：TimeSformer作为时空视觉骨干提取特征，使用DPC进行未来表征预测以捕捉时间偏差；引入基于CLIP的语义流，利用文本提示进行概念级异常检测；通过InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练时序与语义表示；采用上下文门控机制结合场景感知或全局视频特征来调节决策。

Result: 框架实现了将预测模型与视觉-语言理解相融合，增强了对未见行为的泛化能力并提高决策的场景感知性；作者公开了实现代码（GitHub），不过摘要未给出具体量化指标。

Conclusion: 提出了一种将时序预测与视觉-语言语义结合的上下文感知零样本异常检测框架，能够在不使用异常样本的情况下检测复杂场景中的未知异常行为。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

*Ajinkya Khoche,Qingwen Zhang,Yixi Cai,Sina Sharif Mansouri,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow用4D雷达Doppler生成跨模态伪标签并传递到LiDAR，实现无人工标注的3D目标运动恢复，在MAN TruckScenes上接近全监督性能（10%标签即可达90%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自监督3D场景流在长距与恶劣天气下性能不足以及手工标注代价高的问题，利用雷达的速度测量能力为LiDAR提供可靠的运动伪标签。

Method: 核心方法包括实时从4D雷达Doppler获取运动信息、动态感知的模态间关联策略、以及歧义解析的运动传播机制，最终将雷达生成的伪标签映射到LiDAR点云用于自监督训练。

Result: DoGFlow提出了一种自监督LiDAR场景流估计框架，通过实时利用4D雷达Doppler测量生成运动伪标签并转移到LiDAR域，解决了传统自监督方法在长距和逆境天气下性能不足的问题。实验在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显示，DoGFlow显著优于现有自监督方法，并能使LiDAR骨干网络在仅使用10%带标注数据时达到超过90%的全监督性能。

Conclusion: 通过跨模态标签转移和动态感知关联，DoGFlow能在无需人工标注的情况下恢复完整的3D目标运动，显著缩小自监督与全监督性能差距，并提高标签效率。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

*Zhangyu Jin,Andrew Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出将噪声插值的粗糙先验转为细化几何的3D建筑生成方法，并发布50K建筑数据集以提升细节生成与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有从卫星图像生成建筑的模型缺乏几何引导难以恢复准确结构，而细节化方法又依赖高精度体素输入，作者欲在低成本粗先验下生成高质量细节化建筑。

Method: 通过学习从插值且带噪声的粗几何先验到高分辨率细节几何的变换，结合卫星影像作为外观与结构提示；构建并训练在Skylines-50K上的深度网络以生成最终3D模型。

Result: SatSkylines提出一种从卫星影像与粗略几何先验生成3D建筑的方法，通过将插值噪声的粗糙先验映射为细节化几何体，实现灵活的几何控制并保持计算成本低。作者构建了包含5万余个风格化建筑模型的Skylines-50K数据集，实验证明模型有效且具有较强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在结合卫星影像与粗几何先验时，能在保持计算效率下生成更精细的建筑模型，并在大规模数据集上展示出良好泛化。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

TL;DR: 本文定义了从单帧检测STP并选择MSTP的新问题，提出Faster R-CNN + 轻量选择器的两阶段方法，使用adapter与可选检索增强，并在自建五款游戏数据集上给出基线与迁移学习策略对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏中，玩家依赖视觉线索发现地图转换点。自动识别这些点可提升客户端自动制图并为关卡提示设计提供客观评估依据，因此提出从单帧识别STP与MSTP的新任务。

Method: 提出两阶段深度学习流水线：第一阶段使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，第二阶段用轻量级MSTP选择器融合局部与全局视觉特征进行排序；两阶段采用参数高效的adapter进行迁移学习，并可选引入检索增强融合。

Result: 在五款动作RPG构建的数据集上实验：全网络微调在数据充足时能提高STP检测性能，但在低数据和MSTP选择任务中，adapter-only迁移更鲁棒有效；给出基线性能并揭示性能与数据量/适配策略的折中。

Conclusion: 本文提出并验证了从单帧图像检测可通行的空间过渡点（STP）并识别主过渡点（MSTP）的可行性，提供了基线方法和数据集，为后续研究奠定基础。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Motivation: 解决音频驱动角色动画在电影级场景中表现不足的问题，提升表现力与逼真度，支持复杂互动、肢体动作与摄像机运动。

Method: 在Wan基础上改进模型结构与训练数据/损失，增强对复杂交互、肢体与摄像机运动的建模；通过与Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman的基准对比评估性能提升（具体技术细节未在摘要中给出）。

Result: 提出基于Wan的音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，在电影级动画中显著提升表现力和保真度；通过大量实验对比Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman，显示出显著优越性；展示在长视频生成和精确唇形同步编辑的适用性。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V能显著改善音频驱动的电影级角色动画表现，超越现有SOTA方法，并适用于长视频生成与唇形编辑。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DeReF：通过区域交叉注意力解耦、随机特征重组及MoE动态融合，增强模态间信息交互与融合多样性，显著提升癌症生存分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定融合（拼接/注意力）或在MoE中将专家绑定到独立模态，导致模型过度依赖预定义特征组合与专家间信息隔离，限制动态融合与信息交互。

Method: DeReF包含三部分：模态解耦模块（引入区域交叉注意力以提升解耦特征表示）、随机特征重组策略（在解耦与动态MoE融合之间随机重组不同模态的特征片段以增加组合多样性与粒度）、以及基于MoE的动态融合模块（专家网络在多样化重组特征上学习，减小信息封闭）。

Result: 在内部肝癌数据集与三个人TCGA公开数据集上的大量实验证明，DeReF在生存时间预测上优于多种基线方法，提升了泛化性能并改善了专家网络的信息捕获能力。代码将开源。

Conclusion: 本文提出DeReF框架，通过在模态解耦与MoE融合之间引入随机特征重组，缓解固定融合与信息封闭问题，从而提升肿瘤生存预测的泛化与信息交互能力。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE通过合成配对数据+扩散Transformer模型，并用差分掩码监督，专门处理对象引起的阴影、反射、光照、半透明和镜面五类侧影效应，构建ROSE-Bench评测，表现优于现有视频擦除方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频物体移除方法无法有效处理由物体引起的环境侧影（如阴影、反射等），且缺乏配对监督数据，故设计合成数据和专门模型来解决该问题。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎自动生成多样化的配对视频；基于扩散Transformer的视频修复模型输入整段视频进行参考式擦除；引入差分掩码作为额外监督以显式预测受影响区域。

Result: 提出ROSE方法，使用3D渲染合成大规模有配对视频数据，基于扩散Transformer进行视频遮挡擦除并额外预测侧影区域，通过差分掩码监督可移除阴影、反射、光照、半透明和镜面效果；并构建ROSE-Bench评测基准，实验证明优于现有方法并能泛化到真实视频。

Conclusion: ROSE在合成数据和差分掩码监督下能有效去除物体侧影效应，模型在合成与真实视频上均表现较好，证明方法的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 通过构建HMD-270K数据集和提出CSER奖励训练OwlCap，实现运动与细节平衡的视频描述，显著提升细节和运动指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频字幕生成中运动与细节不平衡的问题，提升描述的完整性和一致性。

Method: 数据构建：MDF（Motion-Detail Fusion）+FGE（Fine-Grained Examination）。优化：Group Relative Policy Optimization结合Caption Set Equivalence Reward（单位到集合匹配与双向验证）。

Result: 构建了HMD-270K数据集（通过MDF和FGE两阶段流水线）并提出CSER优化奖励（基于GRPO）。在HMD-270K监督微调及GRPO后训练的OwlCap模型，在VDC和DREAM-1K两个基准上取得显著提升。

Conclusion: HMD-270K与CSER+GRPO训练的OwlCap显著改善了视频字幕中运动与细节的平衡，未来将公开数据集与模型以推动研究。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

*Xin Tian,Yingtie Lei,Xiujun Zhang,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将SNR先验从空间域迁移到频域，结合谱域注意力和频率自适应融合的Transformer模块，构成SFormer，在配对数据上显著提升水下图像增强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间域的SNR先验存在两点限制：（i）难以有效分离通道间的交叉干扰；（ii）在放大有用结构并抑制噪声方面帮助有限。将SNR先验迁移到频域，并结合频谱分解与注意力机制，可更精细地调制通道与频段，从而改善增强效果。

Method: 在频域将特征分解为幅度谱与相位谱，引入基于频域SNR的调制策略来抑制波长相关衰减与通道干扰。设计FAST以结合谱间交互与SNR线索突出关键频谱成分；设计FAT作为瓶颈用门控注意力融合低/高频分支以提升感知质量。整个模型采用U形结构，包含常规RGB流与SNR引导分支（SFormer），在UIEB、EUVP、LSUI混合数据上训练并评估。

Result: 在4800张配对训练样本上，SFormer比近期方法在平均PSNR上提升约3.1 dB，SSIM提升约0.08；在视觉上能较好恢复水下场景的色彩、细节与对比度，说明频域SNR与谱域注意力对UIE有效。

Conclusion: 提出在频域使用SNR先验，通过将特征分解为幅度和相位谱并结合谱域注意力来更好地调制通道，从而提升水下图像增强效果。结合FAST（Fourier Attention SNR-prior Transformer）和FAT（Frequency Adaptive Transformer）模块，嵌入U形网络形成SFormer，在4800张配对训练集上优于现有方法，PSNR提升约3.1 dB，SSIM提升约0.08，能更好地恢复色彩、纹理与对比度。

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Motivation: 现有心脏超声分割虽然在像素级指标上表现良好，但在关键临床指标EF估算上仍存在偏差，主要因只依赖单帧或短时窗多帧方法要么累积局部误差要么丢失细节；因此需要一种能同时兼顾细节与全局动态的分割方法以改善EF估算。

Method: 网络由低层卷积网路（保留单帧局部细节）和高层Mamba时空模块（建模跨帧时空关系）组成；在此基础上设计Spatio-temporal Cross Scan（STCS）模块，通过跨帧、跨位置的跳跃扫描整合长程上下文，缓解局部时空信息的限制。

Result: 提出方法在视频心脏分割任务上通过层次化结构和平衡单帧与多帧处理，结合STCS引入长程上下文，理论上可减轻超声噪声导致的EF偏差并提升EF估算准确性（摘要未给出具体数值）。

Conclusion: HSTSN通过在层次化架构中融合单帧细节与多帧动态信息，并借助STCS模块引入长程时空上下文，可以减少EF计算偏差，提升基于超声心动图的视频分割在EF估算任务上的性能。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

### [24] [Feature-Space Planes Searcher: A Universal Domain Adaptation Framework for Interpretability and Computational Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18693)
*Zhitong Cheng,Yiran Jiang,Yulong Ge,Yufeng Li,Zhongheng Qin,Rongzhi Lin,Jianwei Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Freeze pretrained encoder; exploit preserved geometric feature structures; optimize decision planes in feature space via offline features to correct boundary misalignment—simple, efficient, and broadly applicable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current UDA approaches rely on fine-tuning feature extractors which is inefficient, hard to interpret, and hard to scale to modern multimodal large models. Pretrained models retain transferable geometric structures, suggesting that boundary realignment could suffice for adaptation.

Method: Identify intra-class clustering and inter-class separation in features of large pretrained models; freeze the encoder; perform offline feature extraction for the entire dataset; search/optimize decision planes (boundaries) in the feature space to align target data; enable single-cycle full-dataset optimization with low compute/memory and improved interpretability.

Result: On public benchmarks FPS attains competitive or better performance than state-of-the-art UDA methods, scales to multimodal large models, and generalizes across domains including protein structure prediction, remote sensing, and earthquake detection.

Conclusion: FPS optimizes decision boundaries in a frozen pretrained feature space by exploiting domain-invariant geometric patterns, addressing domain shift mainly as boundary misalignment rather than feature degradation, and achieves competitive or superior results without fine-tuning encoders.

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

*Wasi Ullah,Yasir Noman Khalid,Saddam Hussain Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid InceptionV3+LSTM with an ensemble genetic feature selector (ADFSA) claims near-perfect HAR accuracy with drastic feature reduction enabling real-time edge deployment; however, methodological details and validation need scrutiny.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high computational cost, redundant features, and limited scalability of HAR systems for real-time and edge deployment by producing a compact, accurate, and efficient pipeline.

Method: Customized InceptionV3 extracts multilevel spatial descriptors; LSTM models temporal frame dependencies; ensemble-based genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA) selects compact, diverse, discriminative feature subsets balancing accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity. Lightweight classifiers used on selected features.

Result: Reported 99.65% recognition accuracy on the UCF-YouTube dataset, reduction to as few as 7 features, improved inference time, and feasible deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi.

Conclusion: The paper proposes an optimized hybrid HAR framework combining a customized InceptionV3 for spatial features, LSTM for temporal modeling, and an ensemble genetic algorithm (ADFSA) for feature selection, claiming high accuracy (99.65%) and extreme feature reduction enabling edge deployment.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

*Qun Ji,Peng Li,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColorGS adds adaptive color anchors and an enhanced deformation model to 3D Gaussian Splatting to better reconstruct deformable surgical scenes, improving PSNR/SSIM while keeping real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting has limited per-Gaussian fixed color representation and linear deformation modeling, which fail in capturing subtle tissue color variations and consistent global deformation in endoscopic videos.

Method: Introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives with dynamic anchors and learnable color parameters for spatially-varying textures; design an Enhanced Deformation Model combining time-aware Gaussian basis functions and learnable time-independent deformations; train/evaluate on DaVinci, EndoNeRF, StereoMIS with metrics PSNR/SSIM and runtime.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on surgical datasets: PSNR 39.85 (+1.5 vs prior 3DGS methods), SSIM 97.25%, maintained real-time rendering efficiency; qualitative improvements in texture fidelity and deformation modeling.

Conclusion: ColorGS improves deformable surgical scene reconstruction by introducing spatially adaptive color encoding (Colored Gaussian Primitives) and an Enhanced Deformation Model (time-aware Gaussian basis + time-independent deformations), yielding better color fidelity and global deformation consistency while keeping real-time rendering.

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 按类频率设定洪泛阈值的正则化方法，可抑制多数类过拟合并提升少数类表现，从而改善不平衡数据上的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在类别不平衡下，模型倾向于偏向多数类导致少数类识别性能显著下降；通过类级别的正则化希望在不同类别间取得更合适的拟合程度分配。

Method: 在原有洪泛（flooding）正则化的基础上，将固定阈值扩展为按类频率设定的类特定洪泛水平；训练时对每个样本按其类别应用对应的洪泛损失，防止训练损失低于该类阈值以减少记忆化。

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务上，相较于传统洪泛正则化，所提方法提升了少数类的分类性能并改善了整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的分类洪泛正则化通过对每一类设定不同的洪泛水平，从而抑制多数类过拟合并允许少数类得到充分学习，能在不平衡数据集上提高少数类表现并改善整体泛化。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

### [28] [Flatness-aware Curriculum Learning via Adversarial Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18726)
*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过用原始与对抗样本的归一化损失差作为难度度量，成功将课程学习与SAM结合，提升了泛化与稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在SAM推动下，模型趋向平坦区域，导致损失值和梯度范数普遍减小，传统基于损失或梯度的难度度量失去判别性，因此需要一种在平坦区域仍能反映样本脆弱性的难度度量。

Method: 通过对每个样本构造对抗样本并计算原始样本与对抗样本的归一化损失差值作为ADM，用该指标对样本难度进行排序并在基于SAM的训练中动态调整课程；即在SAM训练框架下按ADM分配训练样本（或调整采样权重/顺序）。

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和域泛化任务上进行评测，ADM结合CL与SAM后在性能上优于已有的课程式和基于平坦性的方法，证明了其在保持稳健性和提升泛化上的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的ADM（对抗难度度量）能在平坦最小值区域中保持判别性，使得课程学习（CL）可以与Sharpness-Aware Minimization（SAM）有效结合，从而同时保留CL和SAM的优点并提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

### [29] [Are All Marine Species Created Equal? Performance Disparities in Underwater Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18729)
*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scallop under-performance is driven mainly by localization (foreground/background confusion) and intrinsic visual classification challenges; fix localization algorithms and tailor class sampling based on precision/recall priorities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why some marine species are detected worse than others beyond mere data imbalance, and to find systematic ways to improve detection for under-performing classes in underwater imagery.

Method: Manipulated the DUO dataset to decouple localization and classification tasks. Used YOLO11 and TIDE for localization error analysis. Performed classification experiments with balanced and imbalanced class distributions to probe causes of under-performance. Evaluated precision/recall trade-offs under different sampling strategies.

Result: Localization failures—specifically foreground-background discrimination—are the dominant error source regardless of data quantity. Precision gaps for scallops persist even with balanced training, implying feature-based classification difficulty. Recommendations: use imbalanced distributions to favor precision, balanced for recall, and prioritize algorithmic/localization improvements. Code and datasets publicly released.

Conclusion: Under-performing classes (scallops) are primarily limited by localization (foreground-background discrimination) rather than just data scarcity; classification issues persist even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic visual feature challenges. Improvements should focus on algorithmic and localization modules; dataset release available.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

Motivation: 现有从点云、网格、文本生成CAD的方法与传统以2D工程图为起点的工业设计流程不匹配，自动从2D矢量图生成参数化CAD是未充分探索但关键的任务。

Method: 将CAD生成视为序列到序列问题：首先将矢量绘图元件编码为网络友好的表示；采用双解码器Transformer分别生成命令类型和命令参数以保持对应关系；引入软目标分布损失以适应CAD参数的灵活性。

Result: 通过新建的CAD-VGDrawing数据集和一系列实验，验证了Drawing2CAD在生成精确参数化CAD模型上的有效性，并公开了代码和数据。

Conclusion: Drawing2CAD能够在保持几何精度和设计意图的前提下，将工程2D矢量图有效转化为参数化CAD模型，实验表明所提方法优于基线并具实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

*DongHoon Lim,YoungChae Kim,Dong-Hyun Kim,Da-Hee Yang,Joon-Hyuk Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a router that estimates token-wise audio reliability and gates cross-modal attention accordingly, giving large WER gains over AV-HuBERT in noisy conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AVSR systems fail in noisy environments because they cannot accurately estimate audio reliability and cannot dynamically adjust modality reliance at token level.

Method: Introduce an audio-visual feature fusion-based router that computes token-level acoustic corruption scores; use these scores to down-weight audio tokens and apply gated cross-attention in each decoder layer to reinforce visual information.

Result: On LRS3, the method yields 16.51–42.67% relative reduction in WER compared to AV-HuBERT; ablations show both router and gating improve robustness under real-world noise.

Conclusion: Router-gated cross-modal fusion improves robustness of AVSR by dynamically reweighting audio and visual tokens based on token-level audio corruption scores, allowing the decoder to rely more on visual cues when audio is unreliable.

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出将HOI检测改为多答案多选的评测框架，针对生成型VLM的多义输出设计负例以降低惩罚，从而实现对通用VLM和专用HOI方法的公正比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期HOI方法将早期VLM（如CLIP）作为组件引入，但大型生成型VLM的出现带来其可能以独立模型直接解决HOI问题的潜力；然而现有数据集（如HICO-DET）和严格的精确匹配评价会因多义性而错误惩罚合理预测，需要新的评价方式。

Method: 提出一个新的基准和评测协议：将HOI检测表述为多答案多选题，每道题只包含真实的正例选项和经人工/规则挑选以减少歧义的负例（例如避免将‘throwing’作为‘catching’的负例）。该协议允许直接对比通用VLMs与专用HOI方法。

Result: 提出的基准和协议消除了对合理多义预测的惩罚，使得生成型VLM和专用HOI方法可以在同一框架下对比，揭示当前VLM在HOI理解上的能力和局限，提供更公平的性能评估。

Conclusion: 该论文认为通用的生成型视觉-语言模型（VLMs）可能已经具备理解人-物交互（HOI）的能力，现有HOI评测不适合评估这类模型；因此提出了新的评测基准和协议，将HOI检测重构为多答案多选任务，以避免将合理但未注释的答案判为错误。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

TL;DR: CmOS generates MCQs with semantically plausible and visually similar visual options using MCoT and RAG, plus a discrimination module to select candidate content


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MCQ generation neglects visual options and manual distractor creation is costly and unscalable

Method: Cross-modal Options Synthesis (CmOS) with Multimodal Chain-of-Thought and RAG

Result: CmOS outperforms baselines in content discrimination, question generation, and visual option generation across subjects/levels

Conclusion: CmOS effectively produces high-quality educational MCQs with visual options, improving scalability and quality over prior methods

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

### [37] [Embedding Font Impression Word Tags Based on Co-occurrence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18825)
*Yugo Kubota,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过基于标签共现的谱嵌入方法，为印象标签构建专用向量，能更好地支持印象驱动的字体生成与检索，优于通用预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 字体形状会传达特定印象，而现有通用词嵌入不能充分捕捉与字体形状高度相关的印象共现结构；因此需要一种专门的印象标签嵌入方法以改进印象驱动的字体生成与检索任务。

Method: 将印象标签视为图节点，基于标签共现构建图并应用谱嵌入（graph Laplacian eigendecomposition）获得每个标签的低维向量表示，使得频繁共同出现的标签在向量空间中靠近。

Result: 在定性与定量实验中，所提方法在印象引导的字体生成任务表现优于BERT与CLIP，说明谱嵌入更能反映标签之间与字体形状相关的语义相似性。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于字体形状与印象标签共现关系的嵌入方法，通过谱嵌入构建印象向量，替代通用语言模型（如BERT、CLIP）在印象语义上的不足。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

*Takayuki Ishikawa,Carmelo Bonannella,Bas J. W. Lerink,Marc Rußwurm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用开放卫星数据与预训练时序模型微调，在数据有限情形下能显著提升荷兰NFI树种分类准确率，优于以往基于随机森林与手工特征的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NFI现场调查成本高且更新慢；卫星时序结合机器学习能扩展与加速树种制图；现有方法主要依赖随机森林与手工表征，深度预训练模型可在少量标注下提升表现。

Method: 在Google Earth Engine上提取Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5和SRTM的时序/高程数据，使用公开的遥感时序基础模型进行微调，并与传统基于随机森林和手工表征的方法进行对比评估。

Result: 经实验证明，微调的基础模型在多个数据集上均优于传统方法，分类准确率提升可达10%，表明手工谐波特征无法充分表示复杂季节反射谱信息，深度特征更有表现力。

Conclusion: Fine-tuning a pre-trained remote sensing time-series foundation model markedly improves tree-species classification for the Netherlands NFIs, outperforming previous state-of-the-art (RF＋手工谐波特征) by最高约10%。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出先验引导的视频级回归与可扩展区间选择+协同优化，提升微表情定位与识别效果，达到SOTA并开源代码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖固定窗口的窗口级分类或手工定义的窗口式区间解码，这限制了对微表情短时、低幅的复杂时间动态的捕捉，且难以兼顾时长与类分布的多样性。作者旨在通过视频级回归和先验引导的区间选择解决这些问题。

Method: 方法包含两部分：1) 可扩展的区间选择策略（考虑时间演进、时长和类别分布）用于精确地划定起始/顶点/结束区间；2) 协同优化框架，使定位（spotting）与识别共享大部分参数，仅分类头分离，从而利用互补信息并在有限数据下更高效地训练。整体采用先验引导的视频级回归替代传统的固定窗口分类。

Conclusion: 提出了一种基于先验的视频级回归方法，通过可扩展的区间选择策略和协同优化框架，实现了对微表情（起始、顶点、结束）更精确的定位与识别，实验展示了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated geometric image-analysis framework accurately identifies and scores microsurgical anastomosis errors, matching expert ratings across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective expert assessment introduces bias and inefficiency; there is a need for objective, quantitative evaluation for training and competence assessment in microsurgery.

Method: They used image-processing techniques and geometric modeling to detect errors in microsurgical anastomoses across three hospital datasets with participants at various skill levels; developed detection and scoring mechanisms mapping geometric metrics to expert error categories.

Result: Geometric metrics correlated well with expert ratings for considered errors, demonstrating feasibility of automated objective assessment; claimed improved efficiency and reliability.

Conclusion: This paper concludes that geometric image-processing metrics can objectively detect and score microsurgical anastomosis errors, effectively replicating expert raters' scoring and improving assessment efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

*Muhammad Kashif Ali,Eun Woo Im,Dongjin Kim,Tae Hyun Kim,Vivek Gupta,Haonan Luo,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过在测试时对全帧像素级稳定器进行快速自适应，并聚焦高jerk片段的有针对性微调，本文在保持全帧合成优势的同时，显著提高了稳像性能和画质，且仅需极少适配步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 像素级全帧视频稳定方法在合成输出时面临视频间运动分布和内容差异大的挑战，固定参数难以对所有视频泛化。为此，作者希望利用测试时可用的低级视觉信息来对模型进行快速适配，以提升稳像效果和画质，同时保留全帧合成方法的优点并提供类似经典方法的可控性。

Method: 引入快速适应机制：在每个输入视频的测试时对模型进行一到少步的微调；提出jerk定位模块识别高抖动（高"jerk"）段落，并对这些段落进行有针对性的适配，从而用更少的适配步数最大化稳定性提升；利用低级视觉线索（可能包括光流、边缘、亮度一致性等）作为自监督信号来指导适配。

Result: 在多个真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法能一致地提升多种全帧合成稳定器的性能（定性和定量），单次适配就能带来显著改善；在下游应用（可能是视频编辑或跟踪等）上也有性能提升。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种基于测试时快速自适应（test-time adaptation，TTA）的像素级视频稳定方法，通过在推理阶段利用低级视觉线索和定位“jerk”片段的策略，对现有全帧合成（full-frame synthesis）稳定器进行快速微调，从而在稳定性和画质上取得显著提升。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Motivation: 解决医学影像诊断中不同人口统计群体公平性问题，特别是在由成像设备和临床实践差异导致的分布偏移下。利用视觉-语言模型(VLM)的强泛化能力和文本提示中包含的身份属性，以显式识别和移除敏感方向。

Method: 并行双分支架构：分离敏感与目标属性；线性投影构建近正交文本锚点，引导跨注意力产生融合特征；超网络生成实例感知视觉提示以编码双模态线索；视觉分支引入基于原型的正则化以强化敏感特征分离并对齐文本锚点。

Result: 提出DualFairVL：一种多模态提示学习框架，通过并行双分支架构分离敏感和目标属性，构建近正交文本锚点并引导交叉注意力，使用超网络生成实例感知视觉提示，并在视觉分支使用基于原型的正则化。在八个医学影像数据集（四种模态）上，在内外分布下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确率，且仅需3.6M可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualFairVL有效分离并对齐跨模态中的敏感与目标属性，显著改善了在分布转移下的公平性与诊断性能，且参数高效，适用于多种医学影像模态。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过对对象与交互查询进行语义增强（利用编码器特征和CLIP语义），DQEN提升了DETR-based HOI检测的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR-based HOI模型中，具有明确语义的查询对检测效果关键，但先前工作多用随机初始化查询，导致语义模糊。加之人类类别固定而对象与交互多变，因此需要对对象与交互查询分别进行语义增强。

Method: DQEN包含三部分：1) 利用面向对象的编码器特征增强对象查询，使模型更关注与对象交互的人；2) 设计Interaction Semantic Fusion模块，利用CLIP推动的HOI候选提取语义特征以增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元（Auxiliary Prediction Unit）以改进交互特征表示。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性性能，并公开了代码。

Conclusion: 提出了Dual Query Enhancement Network（DQEN），通过增强对象查询与交互查询的初始化与表示，提升DETR-based HOI检测模型的性能，并在HICO-Det和V-COCO上取得竞争性结果。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Motivation: 在真实世界轨迹数据中识别群体与单人，以便分析二者在空间利用与行为模式上的差异，支撑人群动力学研究、仿真模型校验与空间设计优化。

Method: 将轨迹按固定时间窗（60/100/200帧）分段，采用Transformer的pair classification对轨迹对进行群体关联判定，经过序列化过滤得到群体与单人集合；并基于凸包、最小包容圆、热力图等空间指标以及速度变化、运动角偏差、清晰半径、轨迹直线性等行为指标建立度量框架，同时按遭遇类型（单-单、单-群、群-群）进行交互分类。

Result: 当前版本主要完成了分类管道和数据集组织、指标体系设计，尚未给出完整的定量比较结果；将支持不同序列长度（60/100/200帧）的可扩展分析，未来工作将补充指标的量化分析及其对仿真/空间设计的验证意义。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一个基于轨迹序列与Transformer模型的行人群体/单人识别与分析框架，主要贡献在于数据结构化、分组识别管道设计及空间/行为指标集的构建，为后续定量分析与仿真验证奠定基础。

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: enable large-scale coral reef mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation by transferring fine-scale ecological information from underwater imagery

Method: multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation

Result: large-area segmentation of coral morphotypes from drone imagery, flexible to integrate new classes

Conclusion: scalable, cost-effective methodology for high-resolution reef monitoring combining low-cost data collection, weak supervision, and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

*Claudio Affolter,Sidi Wu,Yizi Chen,Lorenz Hurni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Integrate vector data to guide image-diffusion models for creating accurate, style-controlled maps via a web app; user study with professionals shows promise and suggests further technical and role-based considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce manual effort and domain expertise required for map-making by leveraging generative AI, specifically image diffusion models, while addressing their limitations in spatial control and semantic layout.

Method: Combine vector data as structural guidance with text prompts to condition an image diffusion model; implement control mechanisms for spatial composition and semantic layout; build a web interface and evaluate with professional cartographers through a user study.

Result: A system integrating vector data with diffusion-based GenAI to generate accurate, style-controlled maps; first to produce accurate maps in controlled styles and deployed in a web app; user study with professional cartographers shows potential for aiding non-experts and professionals and outlines future improvements and cartographers' evolving roles.

Conclusion: Vector-guided diffusion enables controlled, accurate map generation; the web app improves accessibility; GenAI can augment but not replace cartographers, who will shift toward AI-assisted workflows and tool development.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

TL;DR: 通过令牌混合、序列池化与卷积分词器，作者在CIFAR100上实现显著准确率提升与更高推理效率，且训练简单稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在固定上下文长度的视觉任务中，寻找比标准Scaled Dot Product Attention更高效且同样或更好准确率的模型结构，同时降低训练复杂性和对数据增强及位置编码的依赖。

Method: 通过三个主要设计：token mixing（令牌混合）、sequence-pooling（序列池化）和卷积式分词器（convolutional tokenizers），替代或简化了基于SDPA的注意力机制，在较短上下文长度下减少模型规模与计算开销。

Result: 在CIFAR100上，论文报告将基线的‘top 1%’验证准确率从36.50%提升到46.29%，‘top 5%’从66.33%提升到76.31%；在上下文长度小于嵌入维度的情形下，比SDPA transformer更高效且模型体积仅为其60%。同时声称训练稳定性高，并已公开代码。

Conclusion: 提出的视觉模型在固定上下文长度任务上兼顾了性能和推理效率，取得了显著的基准提升并且训练稳定，不依赖 mixup、位置嵌入或复杂学习率策略。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a vision model that adopts token mixing,
sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and efficient inference in fixed context-length tasks. In the
CIFAR100 benchmark, our model significantly improves the baseline of the top 1%
and top 5% validation accuracy from 36.50% to 46.29% and 66.33% to 76.31%,
while being more efficient than the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)
transformers when the context length is less than the embedding dimension and
only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training
stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup,
positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available
on Github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USO通过三元组数据、解耦训练及风格奖励学习统一优化风格与主题生成，提出USO-Bench，实现了风格相似性与主题一致性上的SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将风格驱动与主题驱动视为对立任务，但两者均涉及内容与风格的解耦与重组，因而可以统一建模。

Method: 构建大规模内容-风格-风格化三元组数据集；设计解耦学习（风格对齐训练 + 内容-风格解耦训练）；引入风格奖励学习（SRL）；并推出USO-Bench评测基准。

Result: 在公开开源模型中，USO在主题一致性与风格相似性两方面均取得了最先进的性能，并发布了代码与模型。

Conclusion: USO将风格驱动与主题驱动生成统一在一个框架下，通过构建三元组数据集、提出解耦学习方案并结合风格奖励学习，实现了在风格相似性和主题一致性上的双重提升。

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

### [52] [Can we make NeRF-based visual localization privacy-preserving?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18971)
*Maxime Pietrantoni,Martin Humenberger,Torsten Sattler,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文发现标准NeRF会在几何中泄露细节带来隐私风险，提出了评估协议并设计了ppNeSF——用自监督分割代替RGB训练的NeRF变体，既保护隐私又能高效做视觉定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF在云端可视化定位服务中的应用，模型隐式存储场景细节可能导致敏感信息被重建并造成隐私泄露，亟需评估与缓解方法。

Method: 作者首先设计了一个隐私评估协议，考察去掉颜色头部后是否仍能从NeRF中恢复细节；发现即使只保留几何，使用光度损失训练的NeRF也能泄露敏感信息。为此提出ppNeSF——一种使用自监督学习获得的语义/分割标签作为训练信号的NeRF变体，只用分割场而非RGB来建模场景，从而降低可识别细节。该方法保持3D判别能力并用于定位。

Result: 实验证明：1) 通过新协议可以成功评估NeRF的隐私泄露风险；2) 传统光度训练的NeRF在几何上确实保留细节，易受隐私攻击；3) ppNeSF能有效抹除可识别细节且仍能用于高精度视觉定位，达到了或接近SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种用于在神经场（NeRF）表示中保护隐私的新方法及评估协议，证明常规基于光度损失训练的NeRF会在几何中存储可恢复的细节，从而带来隐私泄露风险；通过用分割监督替代RGB监督训练NeRF（ppNeSF），可以在抹除可识别细节的同时仍然保持对视觉定位任务的判别性，并在定位任务上取得了最优或接近最优的效果。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

### [53] [Enhancing Document VQA Models via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18984)
*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将RAG用于多页Document VQA能在保留资源友好的前提下显著提升准确率：文本检索最优、视觉检索也有效，检索与重排是关键，布局分块效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多页文档VQA面临内存和计算瓶颈：拼接全部页或依赖超大视觉-语言模型都代价高昂。RAG通过先检索相关片段再生成的方式，有潜力在保留性能的同时大幅节省内存与计算资源。研究动机是系统性地评估RAG在Document VQA中的可行性与表现，并比较文本与视觉检索的利弊。

Method: 在多页Document VQA任务中比较多种检索变体：基于OCR文本的检索、纯视觉检索（无需OCR），并结合重排序与不同的分块策略（包括布局导向分块）。将检索得到的相关段落作为证据输入生成模型，从而避免将所有页面拼接或使用超大模型。对比基线为“连接所有页面”方法，并在多种模型规模与数据集（MP-DocVQA、DUDE、InfographicVQA）上评估。进行了消融实验以评估各组件贡献。

Result: 在MP-DocVQA、DUDE、InfographicVQA上，基于文本的检索变体相较于拼接所有页面基线最多提升+22.5 ANLS，纯视觉检索在不依赖OCR的情况下也能获得约+5.0 ANLS的提升。消融显示检索与重排序贡献最大，而布局引导的分块策略并未带来明显帮助。性能提升在不同模型规模与多数据集上均一致，体现出证据选择的重要性。

Conclusion: 将检索增强生成（RAG）引入多页文档VQA能够显著提升性能，且以文本检索为主的方案效果最好；纯视觉检索在无需OCR的情形下也有稳健提升。布局导向的分块策略并非必需，主要收益来自检索与重排序模块。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GRAS基准与GRAS Bias Score，对五种顶级VLM进行评测，发现严重的人口学偏见，最优模型得分仅2/100，评估时需多种VQA问法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs are widely used; need to detect demographic biases across multiple axes; current benchmarks lack coverage

Method: Benchmarking and metric design

Result: Created GRAS benchmark covering gender, race, age, skin tone; proposed GRAS Bias Score; evaluated five SOTA VLMs and found high bias (best model scored 2/100); noted evaluation requires multiple VQA question formulations

Conclusion: GRAS揭示VLMs在性别、种族、年龄和肤色上存在显著偏见；需要多问法的VQA评估；研究资源已公开

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出RoofSeg：基于Transformer的端到端边缘感知屋顶平面分割网络，通过EAMM、自适应掩码权重和几何损失提升边缘精度与几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有屋顶平面分割方法存在三个主要问题：多数非真正端到端，导致分割次优；靠近边缘的点特征判别力差，边界不精确；训练中未充分利用平面几何特性作为约束，从而影响几何一致性。

Method: 采用Transformer编码器—解码器框架以层次化地预测平面实例掩码，使用一组可学习的平面查询来直接回归实例掩码；设计Edge-Aware Mask Module（EAMM）以融合平面几何先验，提高边缘区域特征判别能力；在损失设计上引入掩码损失的自适应加权策略以弱化误分类点的影响，并增加新的平面几何损失以约束训练。

Result: 方法在屋顶平面分割任务上能直接端到端输出实例掩码，相较传统和部分现有深度方法在整体分割精度和边缘细化上均有提升；EAMM和几何损失改善了边界准确性与几何一致性；自适应加权减少了异常点对训练的负面影响，提高了鲁棒性（论文中应给出具体定量评估证明）。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种名为RoofSeg的端到端边缘感知Transformer网络，用于从航空LiDAR点云中直接分割屋顶平面。通过引入可学习的平面查询、边缘感知掩码模块（EAMM）、自适应加权的掩码损失以及新的平面几何损失，显著提升了平面分割的整体准确性和边缘精度，解决了现有深度学习方法的三大缺陷。

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出的MDN结合Nile Red荧光成像与卷积网络，可在蛤蜊血样图像上高效分割并计数微塑料，取得了较高的性能指标，但样本量与生物学通用性仍需加强验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球微塑料污染普遍且可能对人体健康（肝、肠及肠道菌群等）产生毒性影响，亟需高效、自动化的血液中微塑料检测方法。

Method: 采用Nile Red染色的荧光显微成像与基于卷积神经网络的分割方法（MicroDetect-Net，MDN），包括数据集准备、成像与语义分割来定位并计数小于5mm的微塑料碎片。

Result: 在276张Nile Red染色的荧光血液图像上，MDN达到了准确率92%、IoU 87.4%、F1 92.1%、Precision 90.6%、Recall 93.7%，表明模型在该数据集上的检测与分割效果良好。

Conclusion: MDN模型在Nile Red染色的血液荧光图像上能有效定位和计数微塑料，显示出较高的检测性能；尽管采用蛤蜊血作为样本存在局限，但方法有潜力推广到人类血样进行早期数据采集。

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

TL;DR: 提出基于CLIP的ProPy，通过Prompt Pyramid与Ancestor-Descendant Interaction捕捉多粒度事件语义并实现动态交互，显著提升部分相关视频检索性能（SOTA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRVR要求基于查询找到只与视频特定片段相关的视频，现有方法多处理单模态特征，未充分利用强大的视觉-语言预训练模型（如CLIP）。

Method: 以CLIP为基础，构建多层次的Prompt Pyramid来生成不同粒度的事件语义表示，并在金字塔上引入Ancestor-Descendant Interaction机制以实现层间语义动态交互；将这些语义嵌入用于段级相关性匹配和检索。

Result: ProPy在三个公开PRVR数据集上超过此前方法，取得显著提升，并已开源代码。

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性地将CLIP结构改造用于部分相关视频检索（PRVR），提出Prompt Pyramid和Ancestor-Descendant Interaction机制，能捕捉多粒度事件语义并进行动态交互，从而在三个公开数据集上达到SOTA表现。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

TL;DR: 通过在大规模几何血管数据上用热核签名做自监督预训练，能在小样本冠状动脉数据上显著改善壁剪切应力的三类分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接从医学影像用机器学习评估血流动力学生物标志物（如壁剪切应力）需要大量带标签的数据，但真实临床/仿真标签难以获得。借助自监督学习和大规模几何形状数据可以缓解数据稀缺问题并构建更通用的几何表征。

Method: 构建8449个三维血管几何模型数据集，以热核签名（Heat Kernel Signature，基于Laplacian特征向量）作为自监督目标学习几何表征；将预训练的表征迁移到冠状动脉TAWSS分割任务（低/中/高三类），在小样本临床数据上微调并评估性能提升。

Result: 在有限的临床样本上，利用在8449形状上学习到的几何表征比从零训练明显提升了TAWSS三类分割的性能，证明了几何自监督预训练对血流动力学生物标志物评估的可行性与有效性。

Conclusion: 在大规模几何血管形状数据上进行基于热核签名（Laplacian特征）的自监督预训练，所学到的几何表征能够提升在小样本冠状动脉数据（49例）上评估时均壁剪切应力（TAWSS）的分割性能。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测要求高精度、低延迟并能适应生产中多样化的数据标注形式（从未标注到完全标注），现有方法多受限于单一监督假设或效率不足，难以直接满足工业落地需求。

Method: 在 SimpleNet 基础上引入了新的合成异常生成流程以扩展负样本、改良的分类头用于更准确的判别/定位以及改进的训练流程以同时支持四种监督模式，允许利用不同标注稀疏度的数据进行联合训练。

Result: 在四个挑战性基准数据集上达到新的性能标准，同时实现了低于 10 ms 的推理时间（论文宣称），并公开了代码以便复现。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet 成功提出了一种统一多种监督形式（无监督、弱监督、混合监督、全监督）并兼顾高效性的判别模型，基于 SimpleNet，通过合成异常生成、改进分类头与学习流程，实现了在四类监督场景下的高性能与低延迟推理。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

*Serban C. Tudosie,Alexander Denker,Zeljko Kereta,Simon Arridge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于双层优化、使用STE和TDV正则的二值照明模式学习方法，显著提高单像素荧光显微成像在极端欠采样下的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单像素成像依赖于编码光模式的设计以恢复图像；在实际荧光显微场景中，二值光场可由数字微镜器件（DMD）直接实现。为提高在低测量次数（高度欠采样）下的恢复质量，需要为具体任务学习最优二值模式，而非采用通用或随机模式。

Method: 构建双层优化框架：外层优化二值照明模式，内层为给定模式下的重建网络或算法。为应对二值模式的不可微性，使用Straight-Through Estimator（STE）进行梯度近似；并在目标函数中引入Total Deep Variation（TDV）正则项以促进模式的结构性和稳定性。模型在CytoImageNet显微数据集上训练与验证，并与若干基线（如随机模式、传统编码基等）比较。

Result: 在CytoImageNet上实验证明，所学二值模式在不同欠采样率下均优于基线方法，尤其在高度欠采样（测量数远少于像素数）时表现提升明显。使用STE和TDV的组合在训练稳定性与最终重建质量上表现良好。

Conclusion: 本论文提出一种双层优化方法，用于学习任务特定的二值照明模式，以提升单像素成像（特别是荧光显微镜）在极限欠采样条件下的重建性能。

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector
through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a
bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination
patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过在事件相机上安装旋转不平衡质量块产生周期振动，并用运动补偿移除注入运动，本文实现了持续事件生成并提升了重建与边缘检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态或低运动场景下事件相机因无强度变化而无法生成事件的问题，通过人为引入周期振动以持续产生事件，从而使事件相机可用于更多应用场景。

Method: 设计并搭建旋转不平衡质量块硬件以产生周期性振动；开发估计振动参数并对事件做运动补偿的算法管线；基于真实采集数据进行评估，比较有/无注入运动的感知任务表现。

Result: 构建了一个带不平衡旋转质块的轻量级硬件原型，并配套运动补偿管线，能可靠恢复注入的运动参数、去除注入运动并生成干净的事件流，实验证明在图像重建和边缘检测任务上优于不施加运动时的事件数据。

Conclusion: 简单的机械振动加上有效的运动补偿可显著缓解事件相机在静态/低动态场景下的失效问题，使其在实际感知任务中更可靠且成本低。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

### [62] [Few-Shot Connectivity-Aware Text Line Segmentation in Historical Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19162)
*Rafael Sterzinger,Tingyu Lin,Robert Sablatnig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出在历史文档文本行分割中，使用小型UNet++网络配合连通性感知损失（penalize结构错误），并在每个手稿仅用三页标注、小补丁训练的少样本设定下，显著优于现有方法，在线交并比和识别准确率上大幅提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要昂贵的标注，且数据稀缺，因而少样本学习是降低数据需求的可行方向；另外保证拓扑正确性（不碎断、不合并）对后续识别很关键。

Method: 方法为使用轻量级UNet++作为分割骨干，采用来自神经形态学的连通性/拓扑感知损失（惩罚行断裂与非期望合并），并通过从有限标注页中提取小图像补丁来扩充训练样本。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上，本文方法使识别准确率提升200%，行IoU提升75%；在DIVA-HisDB基线检测任务上，使用仅三页标注也达到了或超过竞赛优胜者的F-Measure。

Conclusion: 小而简单的网络加上拓扑感知损失和补丁式训练，在少量标注（仅三页）条件下能超越更复杂模型，显著提高文本行分割的准确性与连通性评价指标，并在DIVA-HisDB基线检测任务上达到或超过竞赛优胜者的F-Measure。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

*Yuzhen Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Xueping Wang,Zhaoyang Li,Gen Li,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过文本单位/表示增强和文本引导的几何特征投影，解决了语言模型对测量单位不敏感的问题，从而显著提升单目3D视觉定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到预训练语言模型对数值量级敏感但对测量单位不敏感，导致文本特征不能正确反映等价的几何信息，进而妨碍3D视觉理解与定位性能。

Method: 提出两步方案：1) 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE)：在预处理阶段通过增加距离描述的多样性（例如对单位和表示方式进行扩充/变换）来强化语言模型对不同量纲映射关系的理解；2) Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE)：将文本特征投影到与几何一致的空间，用增强后的文本引导几何特征的注意力，以改进3D感知融合。

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上进行广泛对比与消融实验，取得新的SOTA，尤其在“Far”场景上准确率提升约11.94%。

Conclusion: 通过针对文本中单位和数值不敏感的问题进行文本增强与文本引导的几何特征增强，该方法显著提升了单目3D视觉定位任务的性能，尤其在远距离场景取得了明显进步。

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 用 Weierstrass 椭圆函数在复域构造二维位置编码，理论结合实验证明可更好地保留几何信息并提升 ViT 性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统一维位置编码在 patch 展平后破坏二维结构，且缺乏几何约束，不能单调反映欧氏空间距离到序列索引距离的关系，限制模型利用空间邻近先验。作者希望设计一个自然表达二维平移不变性和距离关系的编码方案。

Method: 将二维像素/patch 坐标映射到复平面，使用 Weierstrass 椭圆函数生成绝对位置编码；利用椭圆函数的代数加法公式计算任意 patch 对的相对位置编码；将该编码替换 ViT 中的标准位置编码，进行从头训练和微调实验，并用注意力可视化与数学证明支持方法性断言。

Result: 在 CIFAR-100（ViT-Tiny 从头训练 63.78%；ViT-Base 微调 93.28%）和 VTAB-1k 派生任务上均有提升；理论给出距离衰减性质证明；注意力可视化显示更连贯的几何/语义聚焦。

Conclusion: WEF-PE 提出用 Weierstrass 椭圆函数为视觉 Transformer 提供二维位置编码，通过复域双周期性和代数加法公式实现从绝对编码直接导出相对编码，理论证明了距离衰减特性并在若干基准上取得一致性能提升。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: The SoccerNet 2025 Challenges mark the fifth annual edition of the SoccerNet
open benchmarking effort, dedicated to advancing computer vision research in
football video understanding. This year's challenges span four vision-based
tasks: (1) Team Ball Action Spotting, focused on detecting ball-related actions
in football broadcasts and assigning actions to teams; (2) Monocular Depth
Estimation, targeting the recovery of scene geometry from single-camera
broadcast clips through relative depth estimation for each pixel; (3)
Multi-View Foul Recognition, requiring the analysis of multiple synchronized
camera views to classify fouls and their severity; and (4) Game State
Reconstruction, aimed at localizing and identifying all players from a
broadcast video to reconstruct the game state on a 2D top-view of the field.
Across all tasks, participants were provided with large-scale annotated
datasets, unified evaluation protocols, and strong baselines as starting
points. This report presents the results of each challenge, highlights the
top-performing solutions, and provides insights into the progress made by the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过将顶点与面分离生成、只自回归生成顶点并用双向变换器一次性预测邻接矩阵，论文大幅减少令牌冗余，实现约8×的加速并提升网格质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有把三角网格序列化为面/顶点混合令牌的方法导致顶点被重复编码（因顶点被多面共享），引发序列过长、生成低效的问题，限制了速度与质量的提升。作者旨在通过消除冗余表示来提高生成效率和结果质量。

Method: 1) 将网格表示为独立的顶点序列和由顶点间关系定义的邻接矩阵；2) 仅对顶点使用自回归模型生成，从而将令牌数量降至现有最紧致分词器的约23%；3) 使用双向变换器（bidirectional transformer）基于已生成顶点在一次前向中完成邻接矩阵预测并构造面；4) 引入fidelity enhancer对顶点位置进行细化，以及后处理模块去除不良边连接。

Result: 方法在实验中比最先进方法在网格生成上快超过8倍，同时产生更高质量的网格；令牌数量显著减少（约为最紧致分词器的23%），并通过顶点细化与后处理进一步提升自然性与拓扑合理性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种将顶点与面分开生成的高效网格生成框架，通过仅对顶点使用自回归生成并用双向变换器一次性完成面（邻接矩阵）构建，显著减少了序列冗余，提升了生成速度与质量。

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I属性操控方法为每属性训练独立滑条，导致参数冗余、扩展性差，难以细粒度控制复杂内容如人脸，需一种轻量且可扩展的通用操控模块。

Method: 在文本嵌入空间学习稀疏语义方向的轻量模块（All-in-One Slider），通过重组合方向实现零样本与多属性复合操控；可与反演框架结合用于真实图像

Result: Introduces All-in-One Slider for T2I diffusion models enabling decomposed text embedding space into sparse attribute directions for scalable, interpretable manipulation; supports zero-shot unseen attributes and real-image inversion

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider有效解决了One-for-One滑条的参数冗余与扩展性问题，提供可解释、细粒度且可扩展的属性操控能力，并能应用于真实图像

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

Motivation: Need scalable, controllable, and geometry-grounded 3D driving scene generation for robot learning; existing neural reconstruction is static and limited by captures, diffusion models lack geometry and causality.

Method: 生成代理几何和环境表示，并利用从二维图像先验学到的得分进行蒸馏（score distillation）；通过提示和地图布局进行条件控制，结合显式三维几何估计，实现可因果生成与新视点合成。

Result: A method that generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, enabling causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry estimation; combines proxy geometry/environment representation with score distillation from 2D image priors; allows prompt-guided geometry, high-fidelity texture and structure, conditioned on map layouts.

Conclusion: 方法在保持几何一致性与对象永存性的同时，实现高可控、可条件于地图布局的真实感3D驾驶场景生成，弥合了重建方法与扩散生成方法的差距。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Motivation: 提取动机与创新点

Result: 高质量文本结构化分析

Conclusion: 总结贡献与局限

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么是离线静态分析，要么需人工初始化且无法对单粒子连续轨迹进行分解，限制了CNT动态生长的原位量化与实时优化需求。

Method: 提出VFTrack框架，将手工特征或深度特征检测器与匹配器集成到粒子跟踪流程中；使用13,540条人工标注轨迹系统性评估多种检测器/匹配器组合；确定ALIKED检测器配合LightGlue匹配器为最优组合；通过运动向量分解得到轴向生长、横向漂移与振荡分量并用于形貌重建和生长速率计算。

Result: 在大量人工标注轨迹的评估中，ALIKED+LightGlue组合取得F1=0.78，α-score=0.89；VFTrack能自动跟踪微柱并生成可用于区域生长速率分析和形貌重建的运动分量。

Conclusion: VFTrack能实现SEM图像中碳纳米管（CNT）微柱的实时自动检测与跟踪，分解运动为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，从而重建形貌并计算分区生长速率，推动自动化纳米材料表征与CNT合成优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

TL;DR: 把流式视频分割改造成自回归掩码序列建模，AUSM用状态空间维持固定空间表示并支持并行训练，从而实现统一的提示/无提示分割且在精度与训练速度上均有提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景往往需要无提示（unprompted）分割：发现并跟踪视频中所有对象，但当前研究分散在任务特定模型/流水线。借助把掩码作为通用原语，目标是统一提示型和无提示型视频分割。

Method: 将流式视频分割视作自回归（序列）掩码预测，设计Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM)。AUSM基于现代状态空间模型，维护固定尺寸的空间状态，可扩展到任意长度的视频流；并把所有组件设计为可跨帧并行训练，从而在训练速度上获得显著加速。

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS 2018/2019、MOSE、YouTube-VIS 2019/2021、OVIS等标准基准上，AUSM超越之前的通用流式视频分割方法；在16帧序列的训练上实现最高2.5×的速度提升。

Conclusion: AUSM提出将流式视频分割重塑为序列化掩码预测，提出一个统一架构以同时处理带提示和不带提示的视频分割问题。该模型在多个公开基准上优于先前的通用流式视频分割方法，并在16帧序列上训练速度提升至最多2.5倍。

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏专门用于4D（动态3D）风格化评估的基准，阻碍该领域标准化评估与进步

Method: 4D Gaussian Splatting + style transfer

Result: 提出Style4D-Bench基准、Style4D框架及强基线；在多个高分辨率动态场景上实现了在时空一致性和多视角一致性方面的最先进风格化结果

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench与Style4D为动态3D场景风格化提供了评测基准与有效方法，推动该领域研究发展

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D lets users pose 3D meshes via text without training, using a self-attention rewiring in an image generator and keypoint-based optimization to align meshes to generated target images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address language-driven 3D pose manipulation without training by combining image generation and mesh optimization.

Method: Modify an image generator with self-attention rewiring (RSActrl) to decouple structure and pose, generate target images conditioned on input image and text, then perform multi-view keypoint-based pose optimisation to align mesh to targets; avoid differentiable rendering.

Result: A training-free pipeline (Articulate3D) with RSActrl for image-conditioned pose generation and keypoint-based multi-view pose optimisation, outperforming baselines and preferred by users.

Conclusion: Articulate3D successfully manipulates 3D poses while preserving mesh identity across diverse objects and prompts, achieving strong quantitative and user-preference results.

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

TL;DR: VoxHammer通过缓存与替换反演潜在与键值特征，在3D潜在空间实现训练免费且能保持未编辑区域一致性的精确编辑，且在新建的Edit3D-Bench上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多先编辑多视图渲染图像再重建3D，难以精确保持未编辑区域和整体连贯性。受结构化3D生成模型启发，提出在3D潜在空间中直接编辑以提高一致性与精度。

Method: 对输入3D模型先进行反演，得到每一步的反演潜在向量与键值tokens；在去噪与编辑阶段，将需保留区域的去噪特征替换为对应的反演潜在向量与缓存的键值tokens，从而在保持上下文特征的同时进行编辑。

Result: 在作者构建的Edit3D-Bench（包含上百个人工标注的3D编辑区域）上，VoxHammer在保存区域的一致性与整体质量上显著优于现有方法，并能生成高质量的编辑配对数据。

Conclusion: VoxHammer是一种训练免费、在3D潜在空间中进行精确一致编辑的方法，通过在反演和去噪阶段保留已保存区域的潜在表达与缓存的键值特征，从而保持未编辑区域的一致性并实现编辑部分的连贯融合。

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

Abstract: Data valuation and data monetisation are complex subjects but essential to
most organisations today. Unfortunately, they still lack standard procedures
and frameworks for organisations to follow. In this survey, we introduce the
reader to the concepts by providing the definitions and the background required
to better understand data, monetisation strategies, and finally metrics and
KPIs used in these strategies. We have conducted a systematic literature review
on metrics and KPIs used in data valuation and monetisation, in every aspect of
an organisation's business, and by a variety of stakeholders. We provide an
expansive list of such metrics and KPIs with 162 references. We then categorise
all the metrics and KPIs found into a large taxonomy, following the Balanced
Scorecard (BSC) approach with further subclustering to cover every aspect of an
organisation's business. This taxonomy will help every level of data management
understand the complex landscape of the domain. We also discuss the difficulty
in creating a standard framework for data valuation and data monetisation and
the major challenges the domain is currently facing.

*Yanqi Chen,Xiao Yan,Alexandra Meliou,Eric Lo*

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: DiskJoin enables efficient billion-scale similarity joins on one machine by optimizing disk access, caching, and using probabilistic pruning, achieving large speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior distributed methods incur high inter-machine communication and need clusters; existing disk-based methods hit disk I/O bottlenecks. DiskJoin aims to make disk-based similarity join practical and efficient for billion-scale vector data on a single machine.

Method: DiskJoin tailors data access patterns to avoid repetitive reads and read amplification, manages an in-memory dynamic cache with eviction policies to improve hit rates, and employs probabilistic pruning to eliminate many candidate pairs before expensive computation.

Result: DiskJoin is a disk-based similarity join algorithm for billion-scale vector datasets on a single machine. It reduces disk I/O via tailored access patterns, uses main memory as dynamic cache with careful eviction, and applies probabilistic pruning to skip many pair computations. Evaluations show 50x–1000x speedups over alternatives.

Conclusion: DiskJoin makes single-machine, disk-based similarity join practical and orders-of-magnitude faster than prior disk-based methods through IO-aware layout, cache management, and pruning.

Abstract: Similarity join--a widely used operation in data science--finds all pairs of
items that have distance smaller than a threshold. Prior work has explored
distributed computation methods to scale similarity join to large data volumes
but these methods require a cluster deployment, and efficiency suffers from
expensive inter-machine communication. On the other hand, disk-based solutions
are more cost-effective by using a single machine and storing the large dataset
on high-performance external storage, such as NVMe SSDs, but in these methods
the disk I/O time is a serious bottleneck. In this paper, we propose DiskJoin,
the first disk-based similarity join algorithm that can process billion-scale
vector datasets efficiently on a single machine. DiskJoin improves disk I/O by
tailoring the data access patterns to avoid repetitive accesses and read
amplification. It also uses main memory as a dynamic cache and carefully
manages cache eviction to improve cache hit rate and reduce disk retrieval
time. For further acceleration, we adopt a probabilistic pruning technique that
can effectively prune a large number of vector pairs from computation. Our
evaluation on real-world, large-scale datasets shows that DiskJoin
significantly outperforms alternatives, achieving speedups from 50x to 1000x.

Motivation: 解决高并发工作负载下的热点问题，减少因冲突导致的事务中止和死锁，提高并发控制性能。

Method: Paper analysis

Result: 设计 Brook-2PL：基于静态分析的 SLW-Graph 实现无死锁的预定锁获取，并通过部分事务切分实现早期释放锁；在合成工作负载和 TPC-C 上显著优于现有协议，平均加速 2.86x，p95 延迟降低 48%。

Conclusion: Brook-2PL 能在高争用场景下有效减少中止和死锁，提升性能和延迟表现，具有较好的实用价值。

Abstract: The problem of hotspots remains a critical challenge in high-contention
workloads for concurrency control (CC) protocols. Traditional concurrency
control approaches encounter significant difficulties under high contention,
resulting in excessive transaction aborts and deadlocks. In this paper, we
propose Brook-2PL, a novel two-phase locking (2PL) protocol that (1) introduces
SLW-Graph for deadlock-free transaction execution, and (2) proposes partial
transaction chopping for early lock release. Previous methods suffer from
transaction aborts that lead to wasted work and can further burden the system
due to their cascading effects. Brook-2PL addresses this limitation by
statically analyzing a new graph-based dependency structure called SLW-Graph,
enabling deadlock-free two-phase locking through predetermined lock
acquisition. Brook-2PL also reduces contention by enabling early lock release
using partial transaction chopping and static transaction analysis. We overcome
the inherent limitations of traditional transaction chopping by providing a
more flexible chopping method. Evaluation using both our synthetic online game
store workload and the TPC-C benchmark shows that Brook-2PL significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art CC protocols. Brook-2PL achieves an average
speed-up of 2.86x while reducing tail latency (p95) by 48% in the TPC-C
benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: (α,β)-dense subgraph model captures intrinsic bipartite density but lacks efficient query and dynamic update support for large-scale use

Method: Indexing and dynamic maintenance for (α,β)-dense subgraph queries

Result: BD-Index answers queries in optimal time using linear space O(|E|); two maintenance strategies: space-efficient O(p·|E|^{1.5}) per update with O(|E|) space, and time-efficient O(p·|E|) per update with O(p·|E|) space; experiments on 10 datasets show efficiency and scalability

Conclusion: BD-Index通过索引结构和两种动态维护策略有效弥补了(α,β)-模型在查询与更新方面的不足，适合不同资源约束的实际应用。

Abstract: Dense subgraph search in bipartite graphs is a fundamental problem in graph
analysis, with wide-ranging applications in fraud detection, recommendation
systems, and social network analysis. The recently proposed $(\alpha,
\beta)$-dense subgraph model has demonstrated superior capability in capturing
the intrinsic density structure of bipartite graphs compared to existing
alternatives. However, despite its modeling advantages, the $(\alpha,
\beta)$-dense subgraph model lacks efficient support for query processing and
dynamic updates, limiting its practical utility in large-scale applications. To
address these limitations, we propose BD-Index, a novel index that answers
$(\alpha, \beta)$-dense subgraph queries in optimal time while using only
linear space $O(|E|)$, making it well-suited for real-world applications
requiring both fast query processing and low memory consumption. We further
develop two complementary maintenance strategies for dynamic bipartite graphs
to support efficient updates to the BD-Index. The space-efficient strategy
updates the index in time complexity of $O(p \cdot |E|^{1.5})$ per edge
insertion or deletion, while maintaining a low space cost of $O(|E|)$ (the same
as the index itself), where $p$ is typically a small constant in real-world
graphs. In contrast, the time-efficient strategy significantly reduces the
update time to $O(p \cdot |E|)$ per edge update by maintaining auxiliary
orientation structures, at the cost of increased memory usage up to $O(p \cdot
|E|)$. These two strategies provide flexible trade-offs between maintenance
efficiency and memory usage, enabling BD-Index to adapt to diverse application
requirements. Extensive experiments on 10 large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate high efficiency and scalability of our proposed solutions.

TL;DR: 提出层次window graph的增量RFANNS索引，通过插入算法和按选择性优化的窗口搜索兼顾构建效率与任意范围过滤器的查询性能，实验显示构建快、占空间少、查询快且精度可接受。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RFANNS索引难以增量构建及难以泛化到任意范围过滤器以实现优越查询性能的问题。

Method: 在分层的window graph上设计了插入算法，将新的向量-属性对按不同窗口大小加入；通过按范围选择性优化相关窗口搜索，减少属性过滤检查和距离计算。

Result: 实验在真实数据集上表明：构建时，索引时间与最省建造时间的索引相当，比最省查询时间的索引快4.9倍且占用空间为其0.4-0.5倍；查询时，比最有效的增量索引快4倍，并能匹配最佳静态索引的性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种基于window graph的RFANNS索引，支持增量构建并能对任意范围过滤器实现良好查询性能。

Abstract: Given a hybrid dataset where every data object consists of a vector and an
attribute value, for each query with a target vector and a range filter,
range-filtering approximate nearest neighbor search (RFANNS) aims to retrieve
the most similar vectors from the dataset and the corresponding attribute
values fall in the query range. It is a fundamental function in vector database
management systems and intelligent systems with embedding abilities. Dedicated
indices for RFANNS accelerate query speed with an acceptable accuracy loss on
nearest neighbors. However, they are still facing the challenges to be
constructed incrementally and generalized to achieve superior query performance
for arbitrary range filters. In this paper, we introduce a window graph-based
RFANNS index. For incremental construction, we propose an insertion algorithm
to add new vector-attribute pairs into hierarchical window graphs with varying
window size. To handle arbitrary range filters, we optimize relevant window
search for attribute filter checks and vector distance computations by range
selectivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that for index
construction, the indexing time is on par with the most building-efficient
index, and 4.9x faster than the most query-efficient index with 0.4-0.5x
smaller size; For RFANNS query, it is 4x faster than the most efficient
incremental index, and matches the performance of the best statically-built
index.

Main category: cs.DB

TL;DR: SISO is a new semantic cache for LLM serving using centroids, locality-aware replacement, and dynamic thresholding to boost hit rates and SLO compliance, outperforming prior systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve efficiency and SLO attainment for serving LLMs under tight compute/memory constraints by addressing limitations of existing caching (exact/prefix/semantic).

Method: Centroid-based caching to represent multiple queries compactly; locality-aware replacement to keep high-value entries; dynamic thresholding to adjust similarity thresholds based on workload and latency/accuracy trade-offs; evaluated on diverse datasets comparing hit ratio and SLO metrics to state-of-the-art.

Result: SISO, a semantic caching system with centroid-based caching, locality-aware replacement, and dynamic thresholding; achieves up to 1.71x higher hit ratios and better SLO attainment across datasets.

Conclusion: Centroid-based representation plus locality-aware replacement and dynamic thresholds significantly improve cache coverage and SLO fulfillment for LLM serving under resource constraints.

Abstract: Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) at scale requires meeting strict Service
Level Objectives (SLOs) under severe computational and memory constraints.
Nevertheless, traditional caching strategies fall short: exact-matching and
prefix caches neglect query semantics, while state-of-the-art semantic caches
remain confined to traditional intuitions, offering little conceptual
departure. Building on this, we present SISO, a semantic caching system that
redefines efficiency for LLM serving. SISO introduces centroid-based caching to
maximize coverage with minimal memory, locality-aware replacement to preserve
high-value entries, and dynamic thresholding to balance accuracy and latency
under varying workloads. Across diverse datasets, SISO delivers up to
1.71$\times$ higher hit ratios and consistently stronger SLO attainment
compared to state-of-the-art systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有 Text-to-SQL 方法继承了 SQL 在大数据处理和复杂分析方面的不足，且对非程序员不友好。需要一种既能用自然语言交互又能高效处理大规模和复杂分析的新方法。

Method: 在数据库外实现一个基于大模型（LLM）的迭代解释器，逐步构建并执行操作序列；通过按需在数据上执行操作来避免将整表输入模型，支持增量计算以控制复杂度；扩展操作集以包含 PCA、异常检测等分析函数。

Result: 在标准数据库和大型科学表上的实验表明，该框架能有效处理大数据并完成复杂分析，克服上下文长度限制且较传统 SQL 更灵活。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种将自然语言查询转换为可执行查询计划的框架，绕开传统 SQL 的局限，并支持复杂分析操作，适用于大规模表格数据。

Abstract: Efficient querying and analysis of large tabular datasets remain significant
challenges, especially for users without expertise in programming languages
like SQL. Text-to-SQL approaches have shown promising performance on benchmark
data; however, they inherit SQL's drawbacks, including inefficiency with large
datasets and limited support for complex data analyses beyond basic querying.
We propose a novel framework that transforms natural language queries into
query plans. Our solution is implemented outside traditional databases,
allowing us to support classical SQL commands while avoiding SQL's inherent
limitations. Additionally, we enable complex analytical functions, such as
principal component analysis and anomaly detection, providing greater
flexibility and extensibility than traditional SQL capabilities. We leverage
LLMs to iteratively interpret queries and construct operation sequences,
addressing computational complexity by incrementally building solutions. By
executing operations directly on the data, we overcome context length
limitations without requiring the entire dataset to be processed by the model.
We validate our framework through experiments on both standard databases and
large scientific tables, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling extensive
datasets and performing sophisticated data analyses.

TL;DR: 论文提出将分析者定义的过程范围嵌入OCEL，解决过程边界主观性问题，提供工具并在公开日志上验证可行性，能实现跨过程聚合与多粒度分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OCED/OCEL缺乏显式过程范围定义，使分析往往局限于单一过程、粒度较低；现实中事件通过共享对象跨多个相互关联的过程连接，过程边界具有主观性且无法完全自动发现，因此需要一种能表达分析者意图的范围机制。

Method: 提出一种将分析者定义的过程范围编码入OCEL的方案，包括范围描述格式、与OCEL的集成方式、用于范围定义和基于范围的聚合分析的工具，并在一个公开OCEL日志上演示其适用性。

Result: 在公开OCEL日志上完成了方法演示并发布了支持范围定义与分析的工具，证明了方法在组织价值链场景下对解释力和聚合能力的提升。

Conclusion: 在OCEL中嵌入由分析者定义的“过程范围”可以有效表示并行共存的多个过程，支持跨范围事件聚合并实现多粒度分析，从而弥补现有OCED在过程边界不明确时的解释缺陷。

Abstract: Object-Centric Process Mining enables the analysis of complex operational
behavior by capturing interactions among multiple business objects (e.g.,
orders, items, deliveries). These interactions are recorded using
Object-Centric Event Data (OCED) formats, such as the Object-Centric Event Log
(OCEL). However, existing formats lack explicit definitions of process scopes,
which restricts analysis to individual processes and limits insights to a low
level of granularity. In practice, OCED often spans multiple interrelated
processes, as shared objects connect events across organizational functions.
This structure reflects how value is created along the organizational value
chain, but introduces challenges for interpretation when process boundaries are
not clearly defined. Moreover, process definitions are typically subjective and
context-dependent; they vary across organizations, roles, and analytical goals,
and cannot always be discovered automatically. To address these challenges, we
propose a method for embedding analyst-defined process scopes into OCEL. This
enables the structured representation of multiple coexisting processes,
supports the aggregation of event data across scopes, and facilitates analysis
at varying levels of abstraction. We demonstrate the applicability of our
approach using a publicly available OCEL log and provide supporting tools for
scope definition and analysis.

TL;DR: 通过联邦学习共享中心无关表征，作者在多中心DWI缺血性脑卒中分割任务上获得了比集中式和其他联邦策略更稳健的泛化性能，FedAvg表现最佳，且在OOD中心也能保持合理效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床上DWI/ADC为梗死定位与量化的金标准，但病灶分析受患者群体、扫描厂商和专家标注差异影响大；单中心训练的模型难以泛化，且许多中心缺乏标注数据，需一种能跨中心共享知识且保护数据私密性的分割方案。

Method: 构建14个仿真医疗中心、包含2031例DWI研究，通过联邦学习（以FedAvg为主）在本地训练模型并聚合中心无关的深度表征来学习病灶分割；对比集中式和其它联邦汇聚规则，评价指标包括DSC、AVD、ALD和LF1，并测试对不同病灶类别及外部分布中心的泛化能力。

Result: FedAvg在14个仿真中心上的总体平均DSC=0.71±0.24、AVD=5.29±22.74、ALD=2.16±3.60、LF1=0.70±0.26；对未见分布中心仍能保持较好性能（DSC=0.64±0.29、AVD=4.44±8.74）。模型在不同病灶类别上表现均匀，显示良好泛化。

Conclusion: 基于联邦学习的中心无关表征共享能显著提升缺血性脑卒中DWI病灶分割的泛化能力，FedAvg在多中心仿真环境下优于集中式和其它联邦规则，并在未知（OOD）中心表现稳健。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少高昂的像素级标注成本，提升弱监督异常检测方法在黄斑水肿（ME）视网膜层光学相干断层扫描（SD-OCT）中水肿区域（EA）分割性能。

Method: 基于已有的对抗异常检测弱监督模型，先预测密集EA热图；然后利用视网膜层分割结果，将EA分割任务转换为检测EA轮廓与各视网膜层的交点以校正形状，并在测试阶段施加TTA（例如在线微调或数据增强适配）以处理训练-测试分布差异。

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Result: 实验表明，考虑数据一致性的简单两阶段流程在分割性能上领先于专门为该任务设计的复杂一体化方法，说明在任务导向的加速MRI处理中，稳健的重建先验非常关键。

Conclusion: 在加速MRI的分割任务中，简单的两阶段方法（先基于数据一致性的重建，再做分割）优于复杂的一体化专用方法。该论文通过统一基准和多线圈k空间数据的实验，得出此结论。

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

### [88] [RDDM: Practicing RAW Domain Diffusion Model for Real-world Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19154)
*Yan Chen,Yi Wen,Wei Li,Junchao Liu,Yong Guo,Jie Hu,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM is an end-to-end RAW-domain diffusion framework (RVAE + PTP + synthetic degradations + CMB LoRA) that surpasses sRGB diffusion baselines by restoring images directly from sensor RAW, improving fidelity and reducing artifacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing diffusion-based restoration methods operate in the sRGB domain, suffering from information loss and a trade-off between fidelity and realism. Many devices can access sensor RAW data, motivating a direct RAW-domain restoration to preserve sensor-level detail and improve results across capture scenarios.

Method: Introduce an end-to-end RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM) with three key components: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) to learn compact latent representations for RAW data; (2) a differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) module to bridge RAW and sRGB spaces and enable joint optimization; (3) a scalable synthetic degradation pipeline to generate RAW LQ-HQ pairs from sRGB datasets for large-scale training; and (4) a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module to adapt to different RAW Bayer patterns. Pre-trained diffusion backbones are adapted while mitigating OOD issues with these modules.

Result: Extensive experiments show RDDM outperforms state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, delivering higher-fidelity reconstructions with fewer artifacts. The synthetic degradation pipeline enables effective large-scale training, and CMB LoRA handles diverse RAW patterns effectively.

Conclusion: RDDM demonstrates that end-to-end RAW-domain diffusion restoration can outperform sRGB-domain diffusion approaches by leveraging sensor-native data and jointly optimizing RAW and sRGB spaces, yielding higher-fidelity, less-artifact images.

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电磁信号在频时结构、噪声强度和异构性上与文本/图像差异显著，现有模型难以直接应用；下游任务多样且缺乏跨任务泛化与迁移效率，且高质量大规模数据集稀缺，阻碍通用多任务学习框架的建立。

Result: 实验显示 EMind 在多种下游任务上取得强性能与广泛泛化能力，验证了其跨任务迁移效果，并公开了代码以促进研究复现。

Conclusion: EMind 将大规模预训练范式与电磁信号的模态特性结合，提出了统一的电磁信号基础模型，实现了从任务专用模型向统一电磁智能框架的迁移。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:
https://github.com/GabrielleTse/EMind.
