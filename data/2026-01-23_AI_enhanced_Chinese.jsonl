In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.\n  First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6db5\u6d1e\u548c\u6c61\u6c34\u7ba1\u9053\u7f3a\u9677\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u542b\u52a8\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\u3001\u65b0\u578b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7f51\u7edcFORTRESS\uff08\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef+\u81ea\u9002\u5e94KAN+\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff09\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3002\u4e09\u8005\u5728IoU\u548cF1\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6db5\u6d1e\u548c\u6c61\u6c34\u7ba1\u9053\u7f3a\u9677\u6807\u6ce8\u96be\u3001\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u89c4\u6a21\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u3001\u4f4e\u6807\u6ce8\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u9884\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u4f20\u7edf\u589e\u5f3a+\u52a8\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\u6ce8\u5165\uff09\uff1b2) FORTRESS\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027Kolmogorov-Arnold\u7f51\u7edc\uff08KAN\uff09\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b3) \u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff1a\u53cc\u5411\u5e26\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u539f\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u6d1e\u4e0e\u7ba1\u9053\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86IoU\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\uff0cFORTRESS\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53d6\u5f97\u4ee4\u4eba\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6807\u7b7e\u6ce8\u5165\u3001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684FORTRESS\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5411\u539f\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6db5\u6d1e\u4e0e\u7ba1\u9053\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5de5\u7a0b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume.

Representative queries over such data include range queries, nearest neighbor queries, and join queries. However, formulating those queries usually requires domain-specific expertise and familiarity with executable query languages, which would be a challenging task for non-expert users. It leads to a great demand for well-supported natural language queries (NLQs) in spatio-temporal databases. To bridge the gap between non-experts and query plans in databases, we present NL4ST, an interactive tool that allows users to query spatio-temporal databases in natural language.

Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of learnable prompts, deviation-based scoring, and the Top-K MIL strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u8bc4\u5206\u7684FNSAD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Top-K MIL\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u504f\u5dee\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eCLIP\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5408\u7406\u7684patch\u7ea7\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u51c6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5f02\u5e38\u3002", "method": "\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u524d\u7f00\u63d0\u793a\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u540e\u7f00token\u6784\u5efa\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u635f\u5931\u4e0eTop-K MIL\uff0c\u5c06patch\u7279\u5f81\u89c6\u4e3a\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6b63\u5e38\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u5224\u5b9a\u5f02\u5e38\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTecAD\u548cVISA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8ePromptAD\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u8bc4\u5206\u548cTop-K MIL\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u504f\u5dee\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6b63\u5e38\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u6027\u3002"}}

Current mainstream solutions rely on cloud-based data management architectures, but often suffer from performance bottle- necks in environments with limited bandwidth or high system load. To address this issue, this paper explores for the first time the integration of edge computing to move graph data storage and processing to edge environments, thereby improving query performance. This approach requires offloading query processing to edge servers, which involves addressing two challenges: data localization and network scheduling. First, the data localization challenge lies in computing the subgraphs maintained on edge servers to quickly identify the servers that can handle specific queries. To address this challenge, we introduce a new concept of pattern-induced subgraphs. Second, the network scheduling challenge involves efficiently assigning queries to edge and cloud servers to optimize overall system performance. We tackle this by constructing a overall system model that jointly captures data distribution, query characteristics, network communication, and computational resources. Accordingly, we further propose a joint formulation of query assignment and computational resource allocation, modeling it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and solve this problem using a modified branch-and-bound algorithm.

Although existing methods employ event data to address this issue, they ignore the sensor-physics mismatches between the camera output and physical world radiance, resulting in suboptimal HDR and deblurring results. To cope with this problem, we propose a unified sensor-physics grounded NeRF framework for sharp HDR novel view synthesis from single-exposure blurry LDR images and corresponding events. We employ NeRF to directly represent the actual radiance of the 3D scene in the HDR domain and model raw HDR scene rays hitting the sensor pixels as in the physical world. A pixel-wise RGB mapping field is introduced to align the above rendered pixel values with the sensor-recorded LDR pixel values of the input images.

While static algorithms are inefficient due to full re-execution, incremental algorithms suffer from severe performance and memory bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes EAIFD, a novel algorithm for incremental FD discovery. EAIFD maintains the partial hypergraph of difference sets and reframes the incremental FD discovery problem into minimal hitting set enumeration on hypergraph, avoiding full re-runs. EAIFD introduces two key innovations. First, a multi-attribute hash table ($MHT$) is devised for high-frequency key-value mappings of valid FDs, whose memory consumption is proven to be independent of the dataset size. Second, two-step validation strategy is developed to efficiently validate the enumerated candidates, which leverages $MHT$ to effectively reduce the validation space and then selectively loads data blocks for batch validation of remaining candidates, effectively avoiding repeated I/O operations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of EAIFD. Compared to existing algorithms, EAIFD achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in runtime while reducing memory usage by over two orders-of-magnitude, establishing it as a highly efficient and scalable solution for incremental FD discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "EAIFD\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u96c6\u8d85\u56fe\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u6253\u9776\u96c6\u679a\u4e3e\u3001MHT\u4e0e\u4e24\u6b65\u6821\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u7684\u589e\u91cfFD\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9759\u6001FD\u53d1\u73b0\u9700\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8dd1\uff0c\u4f4e\u6548\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u589e\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5185\u5b58\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u907f\u514d\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8dd1\u53c8\u80fd\u8282\u7701\u5185\u5b58\u4e0eI/O\u7684\u589e\u91cfFD\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEAIFD\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7ef4\u62a4\u5dee\u96c6\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8d85\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u6253\u9776\u96c6\u679a\u4e3e\u8fdb\u884c\u5019\u9009\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u54c8\u5e0c\u8868(MHT)\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u9891\u952e\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u4ee5\u538b\u7f29\u5185\u5b58\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u6821\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u7528MHT\u7f29\u51cf\u6821\u9a8c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u518d\u6309\u6570\u636e\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u52a0\u8f7d\u8fdb\u884c\u6279\u91cf\u6821\u9a8c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590dI/O\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cEAIFD\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u53ef\u8fbe\u6700\u591a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "EAIFD\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u62a4\u5dee\u96c6\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8d85\u56fe\u5e76\u5c06\u589e\u91cfFD\u53d1\u73b0\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8d85\u56fe\u4e0a\u6700\u5c0f\u6253\u9776\u96c6\u679a\u4e3e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8dd1\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u4e0a\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Previous pixel-space attribute neutralizers, which rely on convolutional encoders, lessen but do not fully remove this attribute leakage at clinically usable edit strengths. This study evaluates whether substituting the U-Net convolutional encoder with a Vision Transformer backbone in the Attribute-Neutral Framework can reduce demographic attribute leakage while preserving diagnostic accuracy. A data-efficient Image Transformer Small (DeiT-S) neutralizer was trained on the ChestX-ray14 dataset. Its edited images, generated across eleven edit-intensity levels, were evaluated with an independent AI judge for attribute leakage and with a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) for disease prediction. At a moderate edit level (alpha = 0.5), the Vision Transformer (ViT) neutralizer reduces patient sex-recognition area under the curve (AUC) to approximately 0.80, about 10 percentage points below the original framework's convolutional U-Net encoder, despite being trained for only half as many epochs. Meanwhile, macro receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC) across 15 findings stays within five percentage points of the unedited baseline, and the worst-case subgroup AUC remains near 0.70. These results indicate that global self-attention vision models can further suppress attribute leakage without sacrificing clinical utility, suggesting a practical route toward fairer chest X-ray AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528DeiT-S\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u548c\u5668\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684ViT\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u522b\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eU-Net\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u80f8\u7247AI\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u50cf\u6027\u522b\u548c\u5e74\u9f84\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u4f1a\u88ab\u80f8\u7247\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5f53\u4f5c\u6377\u5f84\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6f0f\u8bca\uff1b\u4e4b\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e2d\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08U-Net\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff09\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4e0b\u672a\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u6545\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u64c5\u957f\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u7684ViT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u3002", "method": "\u5728ChestX-ray14\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eDeiT-S\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u4e2d\u548c\u5668\uff08Attribute-Neutral Framework\uff09\uff0c\u572811\u4e2a\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7ea7\u522b\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u5f71\u50cf\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u72ec\u7acb\u7684AI\u8bc4\u5224\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\uff08\u6027\u522b\u8bc6\u522bAUC\uff09\u5e76\u7528ConvNet\u8bc4\u4f3015\u79cd\u5f71\u50cf\u6240\u89c1\u7684\u75be\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\uff08ROC AUC\u3001\u6700\u5dee\u5b50\u7fa4AUC\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u7f16\u8f91\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff08alpha=0.5\uff09\u4e0b\uff0cViT\u4e2d\u548c\u5668\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u6027\u522b\u8bc6\u522bAUC\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u7ea60.80\uff0c\u8f83\u539f\u59cbU-Net\u7ea6\u4f4e10\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f615\u9879\u6240\u89c1\u7684\u5b8fROC AUC\u5728\u672a\u7f16\u8f91\u57fa\u7ebf\u9644\u8fd1\uff08\u57285\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u4ee5\u5185\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u5dee\u5b50\u7fa4AUC\u7ef4\u6301\u5728\u7ea60.70\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e14\u8bca\u65ad\u6548\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u8868\u660e\u5c06U-Net\u5377\u79ef\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u66ff\u6362\u4e3aVision Transformer\uff08ViT\uff09\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u6027\u522b\u7b49\u4eba\u53e3\u5c5e\u6027\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u80f8\u7247AI\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002"}}

Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing.

While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels.

In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities.

Existing approaches typically improve spatial modeling, temporal modeling, or generalization strategies in isolation, which limits their ability to align representations across subjects while capturing multi-scale dynamics and suppressing subject-specific bias within a unified framework. To address these gaps, we propose a Region-aware Spatiotemporal Modeling framework with Collaborative Domain Generalization (RSM-CoDG) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. RSM-CoDG incorporates neuroscience priors derived from functional brain region partitioning to construct region-level spatial representations, thereby improving cross-subject comparability. It also employs multi-scale temporal modeling to characterize the dynamic evolution of emotion-evoked neural activity. In addition, the framework employs a collaborative domain generalization strategy, incorporating multidimensional constraints to reduce subject-specific bias in a fully unseen target subject setting, which enhances the generalization to unknown individuals. Extensive experimental results on SEED series datasets demonstrate that RSM-CoDG consistently outperforms existing competing methods, providing an effective approach for improving robustness.

With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach.

However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay.

Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency.

Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm.

A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Camera-ready Version", "summary": "Active learning (AL) strategies aim to train high-performance models with minimal labeling efforts, only selecting the most informative instances for annotation. Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward.

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, \"outer fabric\" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u5c42\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0VLMs\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u5f3a\u4f46\u5728\u5224\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u662f\u5426\u9002\u7528\uff08NA\uff09\u4e0a\u5f31\uff0c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u5c1a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u76ee\u5f55\u4e30\u5bcc\u5316\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709VLM\u5728\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e14\u5e26\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982NA\uff09\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DeepFashion-MultiModal\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u663e\u5f0f\u5305\u542bNA\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\uff0c\u57285,000\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u300118\u4e2a\u5c5e\u6027\u4e0a\u5bf99\u4e2aVLM\uff08\u8986\u76d6\u65d7\u8230\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d85\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u7ea7\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Fashion-CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u5c42\uff1a\u6574\u4f53\uff08\u542bNA\uff09\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u53ef\u5224\u65ad\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLM\u5728\u5b8f\u89c2F1\u4e0a\u8fbe64.0%\uff0c\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u5347\u8fd1\u4e09\u500d\uff1b\u5728Tier3\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7bF1\u4e3a70.8%\uff0c\u800c\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff08NA\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ec534.1% NA-F1\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\uff1b\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u65d7\u8230\u6a21\u578b90%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u5c1a\u591a\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e09\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u5728\u53ef\u7ec6\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u9002\u7528\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u63a5\u8fd1\u65d7\u8230\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use.

However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation.

We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics.

Ellen Grant", "Davood Karimi"], "title": "Atlas-Assisted Segment Anything Model for Fetal Brain MRI (FeTal-SAM)", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper presents FeTal-SAM, a novel adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored for fetal brain MRI segmentation. Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages.

However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning.

However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain.

To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced.

Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism.

We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness.

However, accessing experts at any time and in any location may not always be feasible. In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score.

We enable ecologists to experiment with ML models independently, thus they can move beyond off-the-shelf models and generate insights tailored to local datasets and specific classification tasks and target variables. Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies.

However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training.

However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x.

Class-imbalance-aware sampling and cosine annealing with warm restarts are adopted to mimic rhythmic regulation and attention allocation mechanisms observed in biological neural systems.Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight brain-inspired model achieves strong and stable performance in binary coronary angiography classification, yielding competitive accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics while maintaining high computational efficiency.Conclusion: This study validates the effectiveness of brain-inspired learning mechanisms in lightweight medical image analysis and provides a biologically plausible and deployable solution for intelligent clinical decision support under limited computational resources.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e14\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3CNN\u6784\u5efa\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c03\u5236\uff08Focal Loss+\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\uff09\u3001\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u96be\u4f8b\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5e76\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u5f71\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u590d\u6742\u75c5\u53d8\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6784\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u795e\u7ecf\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u53ea\u66f4\u65b0\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5c06Focal Loss\u4e0e\u6807\u7b7e\u5e73\u6ed1\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c03\u5236\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u96be\u4f8b\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5e26\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u7269\u8282\u5f8b\u6027\u7684\u8c03\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5927\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001F1\u5206\u6570\u548cAUC\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u7a33\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u8111\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c03\u5236\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u7c7b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u611f\u77e5\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u8282\u5f8b\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\uff09\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u51a0\u72b6\u52a8\u8109\u9020\u5f71\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u6027\u3002"}}

However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation. We release the dataset and benchmark to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis, with direct relevance to multi-organ oncology imaging workflows.

By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u7528MMD\u8bc4\u4f30\u5bf9\u9f50\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u4e0b\u6e38\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u8c03\u67e5\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(VFMs)\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u524d\u5217\u817a\u591a\u53c2\u6570MRI\u4e94\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5fae\u8c03\u524d\u540e\u7279\u5f81\u7684MMD\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cdVFM\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684ProFound\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684ProViCNet\uff09\u5728\u524d\u5217\u817a\u591a\u53c2\u6570MRI\u7684\u4e94\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\uff08\u7528MMD\u8861\u91cf\uff09\u8d8a\u9ad8\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8d8a\u5927\u4e14\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u8c03\u5c06\u4e0b\u6e38\u9002\u7528\u6027\u7eb3\u5165\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347VFM\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, extending 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to multi-spectral scenarios remains challenging. Current approaches often struggle to fully leverage the complementary information of multi-modal data, typically relying on mechanisms that either tend to neglect cross-modal correlations or leverage shared representations that fail to adaptively handle the complex structural correlations and physical discrepancies between spectrums. To address these limitations, we propose ThermoSplat, a novel framework that enables deep spectral-aware reconstruction through active feature modulation and adaptive geometry decoupling. First, we introduce a Cross-Modal FiLM Modulation mechanism that dynamically conditions shared latent features on thermal structural priors, effectively guiding visible texture synthesis with reliable cross-modal geometric cues. Second, to accommodate modality-specific geometric inconsistencies, we propose a Modality-Adaptive Geometric Decoupling scheme that learns independent opacity offsets and executes an independent rasterization pass for the thermal branch. Additionally, a hybrid rendering pipeline is employed to integrate explicit Spherical Harmonics with implicit neural decoding, ensuring both semantic consistency and high-frequency detail preservation.

Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\\texttt{gate\\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \\texttt{gate\\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency.

The pipeline integrates reliable person detection, whole-body pose estimation, and state-of-the-art 2D hand keypoint prediction on tracked hand crops, followed by a constrained 3D optimization.

Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits.

Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features.

While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvolSplat4D\u7528\u4e09\u6761\u4e13\u95e8\u5206\u652f\u7edf\u4e00\u4f53\u79ef\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7Gaussian\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u505a\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u57ce\u5e02\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u5206\u652f\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a1) \u8fd1\u666f\u9759\u6001\u5206\u652f\u4ece3D\u7279\u5f81\u4f53\u79ef\u9884\u6d4b\u8de8\u5e27\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D Gaussians\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u5916\u89c2\uff1b2) \u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u652f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6821\u6b63\u6e32\u67d3\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u566a\u58f0\uff1b3) \u8fdc\u666f\u5206\u652f\u91c7\u7528\u6bcf\u50cf\u7d20Gaussian\u4ee5\u9ad8\u6548\u8986\u76d6\u8fdc\u573a\u3002\u4e09\u5206\u652f\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u4fdd\u771f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faEvolSplat4D\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e09\u5206\u652f\u524d\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f53\u7d20/\u50cf\u7d20\u6df7\u5408\u76843D Gaussian\u9884\u6d4b\uff1a\u5bf9\u8fd1\u666f\u9759\u6001\u533a\u57df\u75283D\u7279\u5f81\u4f53\u79ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D Gaussians\u5e76\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6e32\u67d3\u9884\u6d4b\u5916\u89c2\uff1b\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u7528\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89c4\u8303\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc14D\u7a33\u5b9a\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b\u5bf9\u8fdc\u666f\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6bcf\u50cf\u7d20Gaussian\u5206\u652f\u8986\u76d6\u5168\u573a\u666f\u3002", "conclusion": "EvolSplat4D\u5728KITTI-360\u3001KITTI\u3001Waymo\u548cPandaSet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5168\u666f\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency.

Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models.

However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO.

However, this task is particularly challenging: H\\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis.

It has been accepted by IEEE ISBI", "summary": "Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProGiDiff\u901a\u8fc7ControlNet\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u5272\u3001\u591a\u4e2a\u63d0\u8bae\u4e0e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u5728CT\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u826f\u5e76\u80fd\u8fc1\u79fb\u81f3MR\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7528\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u662f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u8bae\u3001\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u6216\u6613\u4e8e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\uff1b\u800c\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4ee5\u5f25\u8865\u4e0a\u8ff0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u7c7b\u4f3cControlNet\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u5b9a\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u6ce8\u5165\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff1b\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u5272\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u76ee\u6807\u5668\u5b98\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1b\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f4e\u79e9\uff08low-rank\uff09\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728CT\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cProGiDiff\u8f83\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u8f83\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u6848\u5e76\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u5728\u73af\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7528\u4e8eMR\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aProGiDiff\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7ControlNet\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u5272\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CT\u5668\u5b98\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u591a\u4e2a\u63d0\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u9002\u914d\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230MR\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model.

To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios.

To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks.

This paper therefore presents CSSMamba (Clustering-guided Spatial-Spectral Mamba) framework to better address the challenges, with the following contributions. First, to achieve efficient and adaptive token sequences for improved Mamba performance, we integrate the clustering mechanism into a spatial Mamba architecture, leading to a cluster-guided spatial Mamba module (CSpaMamba) that reduces the Mamba sequence length and improves Mamba feature learning capability. Second, to improve the learning of both spatial and spectral information, we integrate the CSpaMamba module with a spectral mamba module (SpeMamba), leading to a complete clustering-guided spatial-spectral Mamba framework.

Last, to seamlessly integrate clustering into the Mamba model in a coherent manner, we design a Learnable Clustering Module that learns the cluster memberships in an adaptive manner.

Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage.

Our approach works by training post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models.

We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes \"in action\" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed \"temporal 3D diffusion\". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting.

However, current methods often suffer from \"blind\" feature interaction, where the model struggles to discern key visual information from background noise due to the sparsity of textual queries. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from human cognitive behavior and propose the Human Vision-Driven (HVD) model. Our framework establishes a coarse-to-fine alignment mechanism comprising two key components: the Frame Features Selection Module (FFSM) and the Patch Features Compression Module (PFCM). FFSM mimics the human macro-perception ability by selecting key frames to eliminate temporal redundancy.

Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space. Yet, this requires known camera metadata, obscuring the application to in-the-wild data where such calibration is typically absent or noisy. We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360\u00b0 generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21T2I\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u540e\u7684RAE\u4f18\u4e8eVAE\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u66f4\u7a33\u3001\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8c\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7684RAE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5426\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0fT2I\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83RAE\u4e0eVAE\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684SigLIP-2\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55RAE\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5305\u542b\u7f51\u7edc\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5RAE\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6269\u6563Transformer\uff080.5B-9.8B\uff09\uff0c\u4e0eFLUX VAE\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5b9a\u57df\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\uff09\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u8bb8\u591a\u590d\u6742\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u76ca\u5904\uff1bRAE\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eVAE\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6VAE\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u707e\u96be\u6027\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "RAE\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eVAE\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u548c\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u7b80\u5316\u3002"}}

We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "PyraTok\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u79bb\u6563\u89c6\u9891\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u8d85\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891tokenizer\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u8f83\u5c0f\u8bcd\u8868\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5165\u8bed\u8a00\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f31\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891VAE\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLaPQ\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u5927\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7801\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u91d1\u5b57\u5854\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u9891token\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cPyraTok\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u5272\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u521b\u4e0b\u65b0SOTA\uff0c\u80fd\u7a33\u5065\u6269\u5c55\u52304K/8K\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PyraTok\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891VAE\u7684tokenizer\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Mitigating Object-Driven Shortcuts in Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition", "comment": "The code is available at https://github.com/KHU-VLL/RCORE", "summary": "We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709 ZS-CAR \u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u201c\u7269\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u8bcd\u6377\u5f84\u201d\uff0c\u7531\u76d1\u7763\u7a00\u758f/\u504f\u659c\u4e0e\u52a8\u8bcd/\u7269\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u5bfc\u81f4\u3002\u63d0\u51fa RCORE\uff1a\u7ec4\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a+\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u7684\u52a8\u8bcd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u672a\u89c1\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709 ZS-CAR \u5728\u672a\u89c1\u52a8\u5bbe\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u504f\u659c\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u4f53\u800c\u975e\u52a8\u8bcd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5171\u73b0\u7edf\u8ba1\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "method": "RCORE \u5305\u542b\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a(1) \u7ec4\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u589e\u5f3a\uff1a\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u52a8\u5bbe\u7ec4\u5408\uff1b(2) \u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\uff1a\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u4f53\u5171\u73b0\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "RCORE \u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7ec4\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u52a8\u5bbe\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5171\u73b0\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u4f53\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u89c6\u9891\u7ec4\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u52a8\u8bcd\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5171\u73b0\u6377\u5f84\uff0cRCORE \u5728\u672a\u89c1\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
