Recent studies have demonstrated that learned cardinality estimation techniques can surpass traditional methods in accuracy. However, a significant barrier to their adoption in production systems is their tendency to violate fundamental logical principles such as monotonicity. In this paper, we explore how learned models specifically MSCN, a query driven deep learning algorithm can breach monotonicity constraints. To address this, we propose a metric called MonoM, which quantitatively measures how well a cardinality estimator adheres to monotonicity across a given query workload. We also propose a monotonic training framework which includes a workload generator that produces directly comparable queries (one query's predicates are strictly more relaxed than another's, enabling monotonicity inference without actual execution) and a novel regularization term added to the loss function. Experimental results show that our monotonic training algorithm not only enhances monotonicity adherence but also improves cardinality estimation accuracy. This improvement is attributed to the regularization term, which reduces overfitting and improves model generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMonoM\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0e\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d+\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8fdd\u53cd\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "Learned cardinality estimators can be more accurate than traditional methods but often violate logical constraints such as monotonicity, hindering production adoption.", "method": "\u5206\u6790MSCN\u5982\u4f55\u8fdd\u53cd\u5355\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4e25\u683c\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u9879\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u7528MonoM\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5e76\u7528\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "Propose MonoM metric to quantify monotonicity adherence, and a monotonic training framework with workload generator and regularization to enforce monotonicity; shows improved monotonicity and accuracy for MSCN.", "conclusion": "\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u7684\u9075\u5b88\uff0c\u8fd8\u901a\u8fc7\u7f13\u89e3\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u66f4\u5177\u751f\u4ea7\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing encoder-only language models achieve high accuracy when fine-tuned on labeled columns, but their applicability is limited to in-domain settings, as distribution shifts in tables or label spaces require costly re-training from scratch. Recent work has explored prompting generative large language models (LLMs) by framing CTA as a multiple-choice task, but these approaches face two key challenges: (1) model performance is highly sensitive to subtle changes in prompt wording and structure, and (2) annotation F1 scores remain modest. A natural extension is to fine-tune large language models. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs due to their scale, and the sensitivity to prompts is not eliminated. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient framework for CTA that trains models over prompt-augmented data via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach mitigates sensitivity to prompt variations while drastically reducing the number of necessary trainable parameters, achieving robust performance across datasets and templates. Experimental results on recent benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our prompt augmentation strategy maintain stable performance across diverse prompt patterns during inference and yield higher weighted F1 scores than those fine-tuned on a single prompt template.

Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u5916\u89c2-\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u6269\u6563\u9000\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u6bb5\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u9000\u566a\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0a\u7f16\u7801\u5e76\u5206\u914d\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u5916\u89c2\u4fe1\u606f\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u6670\uff1b\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u8d1f\u8d23\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u540e\u671f\u8d1f\u8d23\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u7cfb\u7edf\u523b\u753b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6ce8\u5165\u65b0\u6761\u4ef6\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0b\u6cbf\u9000\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7ed8\u5236\u8fd0\u52a8-\u5916\u89c2\u7ade\u4e89\u7684\u6620\u5c04\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e34\u754c\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4ec5\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3b\u5bfc\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u4e00\u955c\u5934\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b9a\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u4e00\u81f4\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u65e9\u671f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3b\u5bfc\u4e0e\u540e\u671f\u5916\u89c2\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3/\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f20\u9012\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u53bb\u504f\u6a21\u5757\u6216\u4e13\u95e8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e00\u955c\u5934\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0a\u6ce8\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7406\u91cf\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u65e9\u671f\u4ee5\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u3001\u540e\u671f\u4ee5\u5916\u89c2\u4e3a\u4e3b\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u5206\u533a\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u6bb5\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u5757\u6216\u7279\u6b8a\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002"}}

Given a query with a starting bus stop and a set of Points of Interest (POIs) to visit, our goal is to find an optimal route on the bus network that allows the user to visit all specified POIs from the starting stop with minimal travel time, which includes both bus travel time and waiting time at bus stops. Although this problem resembles a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem, it cannot be effectively solved using existing solutions due to the complex nature of bus networks, particularly the constantly changing bus travel times and user waiting times. In this paper, we first propose a modified graph structure to represent the bus network, accommodating the varying bus travel times and their arrival schedules at each stop. Initially, we suggest a brute-force exploration algorithm based on the Dijkstra principle to evaluate all potential routes and determine the best one; however, this approach is too costly for large bus networks. To address this, we introduce the EA-Star algorithm, which focuses on computing the shortest route for promising POI visit sequences. The algorithm includes a terminal condition that halts evaluation once the optimal route is identified, avoiding the need to evaluate all possible POI sequences. During the computation of the shortest route for each POI visiting sequence, it employs the A* algorithm on the modified graph structure, narrowing the search space toward the destination and improving search efficiency. Experiments using New York bus network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u516c\u4ea4\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eEA-Star\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u679a\u4e3e\u6709\u5e0c\u671b\u7684POI\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u5728\u6539\u9020\u56fe\u4e0a\u7528A*\u8ba1\u7b97\u6700\u77ed\u542b\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u542b\u7ec8\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5168\u5e8f\u5217\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u5728\u7ebd\u7ea6\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "Handle route planning with scheduled buses and varying waiting/travel times for visiting a set of POIs from a start stop", "method": "EA-Star on modified time-expanded bus graph", "result": "Proposed modified graph structure; brute-force Dijkstra-like baseline; EA-Star algorithm that enumerates promising POI sequences and uses A* on modified graph with early termination; tested on NY bus data showing effectiveness", "conclusion": "EA-Star\u5728\u8003\u8651\u52a8\u6001\u5230\u8fbe\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u7b49\u5f85\u7684\u516c\u4ea4\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u627e\u5230\u8bbf\u95ee\u6240\u6709\u6307\u5b9aPOI\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u65f6\u95f4\u8def\u7ebf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u66b4\u529b\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our architecture leverages 3D convolutions to capture spatial-temporal features from video frames, followed by LSTM layers that model sequential dependencies inherent in sign language gestures. Trained on the WLASL dataset (2,000 common words), ASL-LEX lexical database (~2,700 signs), and a curated set of 100 expert-annotated ASL signs, the system achieves F1-scores ranging from 0.71 to 0.99 across sign classes.

Our survey examines the historical OS-DBMS architectural divergence, production system implementations in PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Linux, and emerging trends including eBPF-based kernel extensibility, NVM-aware tiering strategies, and RDMA-enabled memory disaggregation. Through analysis of over 50 seminal papers from leading conferences (SIGMOD, VLDB, OSDI, FAST), we identify key architectural patterns, performance trade-offs, and open research challenges. We conclude by outlining a research direction that integrates machine learning with kernel extensibility mechanisms to enable adaptive, cross-layer buffer management for heterogeneous memory hierarchies in modern database systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u9886\u57df\u56db\u5341\u5e74\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ece\u7ecf\u5178\u66ff\u6362\u7b97\u6cd5\u5230\u57fa\u4e8eML\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u79bb\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u65b0\u5174\u8d8b\u52bf\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u878d\u5408ML\u4e0e\u5185\u6838\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5904\u7406\u5668\u901f\u5ea6\u8fdc\u8d85\u5b58\u50a8\u8bbf\u95ee\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f25\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5dee\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5176\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u5927\uff1b\u65b0\u786c\u4ef6\uff08NVM\u3001RDMA\uff09\u4e0e\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u5206\u79bb\u8d8b\u52bf\u4fc3\u4f7f\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7efc\u8ff0\u548c\u5bf9\u8d85\u8fc750\u7bc7\u5173\u952e\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\uff1b\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08PostgreSQL\u3001Oracle\u3001Linux\uff09\u6848\u4f8b\u8ba8\u8bba\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u603b\u7ed3\u8d8b\u52bf\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e86\u7ecf\u5178\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7f13\u51b2\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u751f\u4ea7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u6298\u8877\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86ML\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5185\u6838\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u5982eBPF\uff09\u3001NVM\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5c42\u548cRDMA\u5185\u5b58\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5217\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5efa\u8bae\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5185\u6838\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8de8\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u7ba1\u7406\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5f02\u6784\u5185\u5b58\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u82e5\u5e72\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u6027\u80fd\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff09\u3002"}}

Existing graph analysis systems, mostly based on static snapshots, struggle to effectively capture information flows along the temporal dimension. To address this challenge, we introduce ChronoConnect, a novel system that enables tracking temporal pathways in temporal graph, especially beneficial to downstream mining tasks, e.g., understanding what are the critical pathways in propagating information towards a specific group of vertices. Built on ChronoConnect, users can conveniently configure and execute a variety of temporal traversal algorithms to efficiently analyze information diffusion processes under time constraints. Moreover, ChronoConnect utilizes parallel processing to tackle the explosive size-growth of evolving graphs. We showcase the effectiveness and enhanced performance of ChronoConnect through the implementation of algorithms that track pathways along highly dynamic vertices in temporal graphs. Furthermore, we offer an interactive user interface for graph visualization and query result exploration. We envision ChronoConnect to become a powerful tool for users to examine how information spreads over a temporal graph.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa ChronoConnect \u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u904d\u5386\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u5206\u6790\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u5feb\u7167\u7684\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u904d\u5386\u7684\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u904d\u5386\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff1b\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u754c\u9762\u7528\u4e8e\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0e\u7ed3\u679c\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "ChronoConnect \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u56fe\uff08temporal graph\uff09\u4e2d\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u914d\u7f6e\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u904d\u5386\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u89c4\u6a21\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u754c\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "ChronoConnect \u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u6316\u6398\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u5173\u952e\u4f20\u64ad\u8def\u5f84\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u4e0e\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u754c\u9762\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce VISTA (Visual-Information Separation for Text-based Analysis), a modular framework that decouples perception from reasoning via an explicit information bottleneck. A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures.

In location based services, many users probably submit R$k$NN queries simultaneously. However, existing methods largely overlook how to efficiently process multiple such queries together, missing opportunities to share redundant computations and thus reduce overall processing costs. To address this, this work is the first to explore batch processing of multiple R$k$NN queries, aiming to minimize total computation by sharing duplicate calculations across queries. To tackle this issue, we propose the BR$k$NN-Light algorithm, which uses rapid verification and pruning strategies based on geometric constraints, along with an optimized range search technique, to speed up the process of identifying the R$k$NNs for each query. Furthermore, it proposes a dynamic distance caching mechanism to enable computation reuse when handling multiple queries, thereby significantly reducing unnecessary computations. Experiments on multiple real-world road networks demonstrate the superiority of the BR$k$NN-Light algorithm on the processing of batch queries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u591aRkNN\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6279\u5904\u7406\uff0cBRkNN-Light\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u526a\u679d\u4e0e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8def\u7f51\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u67e5\u8be2\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0a\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684RkNN\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\uff0c\u591a\u7528\u6237\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4ea4\u67e5\u8be2\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6279\u91cfRkNN\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5feb\u901f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u56f4\u641c\u7d22\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u8ddd\u79bb\u7f13\u5b58\u4ee5\u590d\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8def\u7f51\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51faBRkNN-Light\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u526a\u679d\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u641c\u7d22\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u8ddd\u79bb\u7f13\u5b58\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u7528\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5904\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "BRkNN-Light\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5171\u4eab\u591a\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u526a\u679d\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8def\u7f51\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u6279\u91cfRkNN\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

We introduce SAMM2D, a dual-encoder framework that achieves an AUC of 0.686 on the RSNA intracranial aneurysm dataset; an improvement of 32% over the clinical baseline. In a comprehensive ablation across six augmentation regimes, we made a striking discovery: any form of data augmentation degraded performance when coupled with a strong pretrained backbone. Our unaugmented baseline model outperformed all augmented variants by 1.75--2.23 percentage points (p < 0.01), overturning the assumption that \"more augmentation is always better\" in low-data medical settings. We hypothesize that ImageNet-pretrained features already capture robust invariances, rendering additional augmentations both redundant and disruptive to the learned feature manifold. By calibrating the decision threshold, SAMM2D reaches 95% sensitivity, surpassing average radiologist performance, and translates to a projected \\$13.9M in savings per 1,000 patients in screening applications. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm that 85% of true positives attend to relevant vascular regions (62% IoU with expert annotations), demonstrating the model's clinically meaningful focus.

LLMs provide generally reasonable suggestions, but often fail to generate optimal plans that account for detailed user requirements, given the vast number of potential POIs and possible routes based on POI combinations within a real-world road network. In this case, a route-planning API could serve as an external tool, accepting a sequence of keywords and returning the top-$k$ best routes tailored to user requests. To address this need, this paper introduces the Keyword-Aware Top-$k$ Routes (KATR) query that provides a more flexible and comprehensive semantic to route planning that caters to various user's preferences including flexible POI visiting order, flexible travel distance budget, and personalized POI ratings. Subsequently, we propose an explore-and-bound paradigm to efficiently process KATR queries by eliminating redundant candidates based on estimated score bounds from global to local levels.

However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

We first replicate TinySAM on COCO val2017 using official checkpoints, matching the reported AP within 0.03%, establishing a reliable experimental baseline. Building on this, we propose Tiny-YOLOSAM, a fast hybrid pipeline that uses a recent YOLO detector (YOLOv12) to generate box prompts for TinySAM on salient foreground objects, and supplements uncovered regions with sparse point prompts sampled only where YOLO-guided masks provide no coverage. On COCO val2017, the hybrid system substantially improves class-agnostic coverage (AR from 16.4% to 77.1%, mIoU from 19.2% to 67.8%) while reducing end-to-end runtime from 49.20s/image to 10.39s/image (4.7x) on an Apple M1 Pro CPU.

In this paper, we introduce the notion of s-reachability, where two vertices are s-reachable if there exists a sequence of hyperedges (i.e., a walk) connecting them, such that each pair of consecutive hyperedges shares at least s vertices. Moreover, we define the max-reachability query as a generalized form of the s-reachability problem, which aims to find the largest value of s that allows one vertex to reach another. To answer max-reachability queries in hypergraphs, we first analyze limitations of the existing vertex-to-vertex and hyperedge-to-hyperedge indexing techniques. We then introduce the HL-index, a compact vertex-to-hyperedge index tailored for the max-reachability problem.

Limited access to physicians often leaves DR undiagnosed. To address this, AI models utilize lesion segmentation for interpretability; however, manually annotating lesions is impractical for clinicians. Physicians require a model that explains the reasoning for classifications rather than just highlighting lesion locations. Furthermore, current models are one-dimensional, relying on a single imaging modality for explainability and achieving limited effectiveness. In contrast, a quantitative-detection system that identifies individual DR lesions in natural language would overcome these limitations, enabling diverse applications in screening, treatment, and research settings. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel multimodal explainability model utilizing a VLM with few-shot learning, which mimics an ophthalmologist's reasoning by analyzing lesion distributions within retinal quadrants for fundus images. The model generates paired Grad-CAM heatmaps, showcasing individual neuron weights across both OCT and fundus images, which visually highlight the regions contributing to DR severity classification.

To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy.

In the era of Big Data, traditional batch ER is often infeasible due to volume and velocity constraints, necessitating Progressive ER methods that maximize recall within a limited computational budget. However, existing progressive approaches fail to scale to high-velocity streams because they rely on deterministic sorting to prioritize candidate pairs, a process that incurs prohibitive super-linear complexity and heavy initialization costs. To address this scalability wall, we introduce SPER (Stochastic Progressive ER), a novel framework that redefines prioritization as a sampling problem rather than a ranking problem. By replacing global sorting with a continuous stochastic bipartite maximization strategy, SPER acts as a probabilistic high-pass filter that selects high-utility pairs in strictly linear time. Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate that SPER achieves significant speedups (3x to 6x) over state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable recall and precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u4ece\u6392\u5e8f\u53d8\u4e3a\u91c7\u6837\uff0cSPER\u7528\u968f\u673a\u53cc\u8fb9\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5019\u9009\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5927\u6570\u636e/\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0fER\u4f9d\u8d56\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u6765\u4f18\u5148\u5316\u5019\u9009\u5bf9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d85\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u9ad8\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u9ad8\u901f\u6d41\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u6700\u5927\u5316\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStochastic Progressive ER (SPER)\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u968f\u673a\u53cc\u8fb9\u6700\u5927\u5316\u66ff\u6362\u5168\u5c40\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u628a\u4f18\u5148\u9009\u53d6\u9ad8\u4ef7\u503c\u5019\u9009\u5bf9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u770b\u4f5c\u6982\u7387\u9ad8\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7ef4\u62a4\u9ad8-\u6548\u7528\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSPER\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u83b7\u5f973x\u52306x\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SPER\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u95ee\u9898\u4ece\u6392\u5e8f\uff08ranking\uff09\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u91c7\u6837\uff08sampling\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5019\u9009\u5bf9\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7a81\u7834\u4f20\u7edf\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u5b9e\u4f53\u89e3\u6790\u5728\u9ad8\u901f\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "Signal-SGN++\uff1a\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u65f6\u9891\u8109\u51b2\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u62d3\u6251\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfGCN\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\uff1bSNN\u80fd\u6548\u9ad8\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u9891\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u6545\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u70b9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa1D-SGC\u548cFSC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u7a7a\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff1b\u5728\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165TSSA\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b\u5f15\u5165MWTF\u5206\u652f\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c0f\u6ce2\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u7528TATF\u5728\u878d\u5408\u4e2d\u4fdd\u7559\u62d3\u6251\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cSignal-SGN++\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u80fd\u8017\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SNN\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684GCN\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSignal-SGN++\uff0c\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8109\u51b2\u56fe\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\u65f6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u80fd\u6548\u4e0b\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u3002"}}

These results underscore the efficacy of integrating large-scale vision-language pretraining with targeted cross-modal refinement to overcome imbalance and generalization challenges in PAR.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVLM-PAR\uff1a\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u7d27\u51d1\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u57df\u79fb\u4f4d\uff0c\u5728PA100K\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u548c\u5747\u8861\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u884c\u4eba\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u53d7\u7c7b\u522b\u6781\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u52a0\u4ee5\u8f7b\u91cf\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u7f55\u89c1\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u8fa8\u8bc6\u4e0e\u603b\u4f53\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684SigLIP 2\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\u5e76\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u7c7b\u5934\u9884\u6d4b\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5c5e\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0d\u53d8\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "VLM-PAR\u5728PA100K\u3001PETA\u3001Market-1501\u7b49\u884c\u4eba\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684SigLIP 2\u591a\u8bed\u79cd\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0a\u52a0\u5165\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8de8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\uff08prompt\uff09\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86PA100K\u7684\u65b0SOTA\uff0c\u5e76\u5728PETA\u548cMarket-1501\u4e0a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7cbe\u70bc\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u884c\u4eba\u5c5e\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6574\u4e2a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds.

However, their performance is frequently constrained by the overly simplistic front-end designs employed in models like ViTPose. This naive patchification mechanism struggles to effectively handle multi-scale variations and results in irreversible information loss during the initial feature extraction phase. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel KAN-enhanced FPN-Stem architecture. Through rigorous ablation studies, we first identified that the true bottleneck for performance improvement lies not in plug-and-play attention modules (e.g., CBAM), but in the post-fusion non-linear smoothing step within the FPN. Guided by this insight, our core innovation is to retain the classic \"upsample-and-add\" fusion stream of the FPN, but replace its terminal, standard linear 3x3 smoothing convolution with a powerful KAN-based convolutional layer. Leveraging its superior non-linear modeling capabilities, this KAN-based layer adaptively learns and rectifies the \"artifacts\" generated during the multi-scale fusion process. Extensive experiments on the COCO dataset demonstrate that our KAN-FPN-Stem achieves a significant performance boost of up to +2.0 AP over the lightweight ViTPose-S baseline. This work not only delivers a plug-and-play, high-performance module but, more importantly, reveals that: the performance bottleneck in ViT front-end often lies not in 'feature refinement' (Attention), but in the quality of 'feature fusion' (Fusion). Furthermore, it provides an effective path to address this bottleneck through the introduction of the KAN operator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6307\u51faViT\u524d\u7aef\u74f6\u9888\u5728\u4e8e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u8d28\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7528KAN\u5377\u79ef\u66ff\u6362FPN\u672b\u7aef\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u5e73\u6ed1\u5c42\u4ee5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u6b63\u878d\u5408\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728COCO\u4e0a\u5bf9ViTPose-S\u63d0\u5347\u7ea62.0 AP\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ViT\u524d\u7aef\uff08\u5982ViTPose\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u7b80\u5355patchification\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u6362\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\u5e76\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u9636\u6bb5\u9020\u6210\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u524d\u7aef\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u53bb\u4f2a\u5f71\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edfFPN\u4fdd\u7559\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u76f8\u52a0\u7684\u878d\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ec5\u5c06\u7ec8\u7aef\u5e73\u6ed1\u64cd\u4f5c\u66ff\u6362\u4e3aKAN\u5377\u79ef\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u5728FPN\u7684\u878d\u5408\u540e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5e73\u6ed1\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53ef\u63d2\u62d4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\u5728COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ee5ViTPose-S\u4e3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1KAN-FPN-Stem\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "result": "\u5728COCO\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cKAN-FPN-Stem\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7ViTPose-S\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u5e26\u6765\u7ea6+2.0 AP\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u524d\u7aef\u6539\u8fdb\u624b\u6bb5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684KAN\u589e\u5f3aFPN-Stem\u901a\u8fc7\u5728FPN\u7684\u201cupsample-and-add\u201d\u878d\u5408\u6d41\u672b\u7aef\u66ff\u6362\u6807\u51c6\u76843x3\u7ebf\u6027\u5e73\u6ed1\u5377\u79ef\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u7684KAN\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fee\u6b63\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ViT\u524d\u7aef\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u5bc6\u96c6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Specifically, a meta-information encoding module transforms clinical parameters into semantic prompts by considering patient characteristics, dose-related information, and semi-quantitative parameters, enabling cross-modal alignment between textual meta-information and image reconstruction. Additionally, the cross-domain architecture combines projection-domain and image-domain processing. In the projection domain, a specialized sinogram adapter captures global physical structures through convolution operations equivalent to global image-domain filtering.

To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy.

However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant.

This reflects a broader semantic gap between human perception and current generative models. We investigate whether geometric understanding can be introduced without specialized training by using lightweight, off-the-shelf discriminators as external guidance signals. We propose a Human Perception Embedding (HPE) teacher trained on the THINGS triplet dataset, which captures human sensitivity to object shape. By injecting gradients from this teacher into the latent diffusion process, we show that geometry and style can be separated in a controllable manner. We evaluate this approach across three architectures: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with a U-Net backbone, the flow-matching model SiT-XL/2, and the diffusion transformer PixArt-\u03a3. Our experiments reveal that flow models tend to drift back toward their default trajectories without continuous guidance, and we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of complex three-dimensional shapes, such as an Eames chair, onto conflicting materials such as pink metal. This guided generation improves semantic alignment by about 80 percent compared to unguided baselines. Overall, our results show that small teacher models can reliably guide large generative systems, enabling stronger geometric control and broadening the creative range of text-to-image synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faHPE\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\u6ce8\u5165\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u7ea680%\u63d0\u5347\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f62\u72b6\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7ec6\u8282\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u9762\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6697\u793a\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5916\u90e8\u5224\u522b\u5668\u5728\u4e0d\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\u4ee5\u7f29\u5c0f\u8be5\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728THINGS\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684HPE\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u8be5\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5bf9Stable Diffusion v1.5\uff08U-Net\uff09\u3001\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578bSiT-XL/2\u548c\u6269\u6563Transformer PixArt-\u03a3\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fde\u7eed\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u53ca\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u56de\u5f52\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f62\u72b6\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u51b2\u7a81\u6750\u8d28\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u7ed3\u679c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165HPE\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u51e0\u4f55\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u53d1\u73b0\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u82e5\u65e0\u6301\u7eed\u6307\u5bfc\u4f1a\u56de\u5f52\u9ed8\u8ba4\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u4e09\u7ef4\u5f62\u72b6\uff08\u5982Eames\u6905\uff09\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u51b2\u7a81\u6750\u8d28\uff08\u5982\u7c89\u8272\u91d1\u5c5e\uff09\uff1b\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u6307\u5bfc\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea680%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u5224\u522b\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08Human Perception Embedding\uff0cHPE\uff09\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u98ce\u683c\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u6587\u751f\u56fe\u7684\u521b\u9020\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles.

Deep learning has the potential to enhance sonographers' efficiency and support the training of new practitioners. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are particularly promising for ultrasound interpretation, as they can jointly process images and text to perform multiple clinical tasks within a single framework. However, despite the expansion of VLMs, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate their performance in fetal ultrasound imaging. This gap is primarily due to the modality's challenging nature, operator dependency, and the limited public availability of datasets. To address this gap, we present Fetal-Gauge, the first and largest visual question answering benchmark specifically designed to evaluate VLMs across various fetal ultrasound tasks. Our benchmark comprises over 42,000 images and 93,000 question-answer pairs, spanning anatomical plane identification, visual grounding of anatomical structures, fetal orientation assessment, clinical view conformity, and clinical diagnosis. We systematically evaluate several state-of-the-art VLMs, including general-purpose and medical-specific models, and reveal a substantial performance gap: the best-performing model achieves only 55\\% accuracy, far below clinical requirements. Our analysis identifies critical limitations of current VLMs in fetal ultrasound interpretation, highlighting the urgent need for domain-adapted architectures and specialized training approaches.

We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware.

The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores.

However, current methods face two challenges: scale inconsistency, where variations in subject size lead to unnatural generation, and permutation sensitivity, where the order of reference inputs causes subject distortion. In this paper, we propose MoFu, a unified framework that tackles both challenges. For scale inconsistency, we introduce Scale-Aware Modulation (SMO), an LLM-guided module that extracts implicit scale cues from the prompt and modulates features to ensure consistent subject sizes. To address permutation sensitivity, we present a simple yet effective Fourier Fusion strategy that processes the frequency information of reference features via the Fast Fourier Transform to produce a unified representation.

Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks.

SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on forward modeling, e.g., learning holistic mappings from text to motion or composing a complex motion from a set of motion concepts. In this paper, we consider the inverse perspective: decomposing a holistic motion into semantically meaningful sub-components. We propose DeMoGen, a compositional training paradigm for decompositional learning that employs an energy-based diffusion model. This energy formulation directly captures the composed distribution of multiple motion concepts, enabling the model to discover them without relying on ground-truth motions for individual concepts. Within this paradigm, we introduce three training variants to encourage a decompositional understanding of motion: 1. DeMoGen-Exp explicitly trains on decomposed text prompts; 2. DeMoGen-OSS performs orthogonal self-supervised decomposition; 3. DeMoGen-SC enforces semantic consistency between original and decomposed text embeddings. These variants enable our approach to disentangle reusable motion primitives from complex motion sequences. We also demonstrate that the decomposed motion concepts can be flexibly recombined to generate diverse and novel motions, generalizing beyond the training distribution. Additionally, we construct a text-decomposed dataset to support compositional training, serving as an extended resource to facilitate text-to-motion generation and motion composition.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u6587\u63d0\u51faDeMoGen\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u6574\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u91cd\u7528\u52a8\u4f5c\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u4e09\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u53d8\u4f53\uff08Exp, OSS, SC\uff09\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5206\u89e3\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5206\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4fa7\u91cd\u6b63\u5411\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u6587\u672c\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u6216\u4ece\u6982\u5ff5\u96c6\u7ec4\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u6574\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u9006\u5411\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u539f\u8bed\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u80fd\u91cf\u57fa\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u591a\u4e2a\u52a8\u4f5c\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1aDeMoGen-Exp\uff08\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u89e3\u6587\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u3001DeMoGen-OSS\uff08\u6b63\u4ea4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u89e3\uff09\u3001DeMoGen-SC\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u6587\u672c\u5206\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u6210\u529f\u5b66\u4e60\u8bed\u4e49\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b50\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u72ec\u6982\u5ff5\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u5206\u79bb\u52a8\u4f5c\u539f\u8bed\uff1b\u5206\u89e3\u540e\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53ef\u4efb\u610f\u91cd\u7ec4\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u65b0\u9896\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u4e0a\u8d85\u51fa\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5206\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "DeMoGen\u80fd\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5355\u72ec\u6982\u5ff5\u771f\u5b9e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80fd\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u89e3\u5e76\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u7ec4\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration. The resulting latent embeddings are subsequently used for MGMT promoter methylation classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u89c6\u89d2VAE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9T1Gd\u4e0eFLAIR\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u5e76\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584MGMT\u542f\u52a8\u5b50\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u7684MRI\u65e0\u521b\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6216\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5efa\u6a21\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001MRI\u5728\u9884\u6d4bGBM\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u578b\uff08\u5982MGMT\u7532\u57fa\u5316\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u6982\u7387\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u5206\u522b\u7f16\u7801\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\u3002", "method": "\u9488\u5bf9\u4e24\u79cdMRI\u6a21\u6001\uff08T1Gd\u4e0eFLAIR\uff09\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u8bbe\u8ba1\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ef4\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8868\u5f81\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u4e0b\u754c\uff08ELBO\uff09\u7ea6\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u5197\u4f59\uff1b\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u7684MGMT\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5bf9MGMT\u542f\u52a8\u5b50\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65e9\u671f\u878d\u5408\u548c\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff09\uff1b\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08VAE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9T1Gd\u548cFLAIR\u5f71\u50cf\u7684\u653e\u5c04\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3aMGMT\u542f\u52a8\u5b50\u7532\u57fa\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u65e0\u521b\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists.

This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data.\n  We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats.

In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines.

Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model.

Diffusion models achieve high accuracy by formulating detection as a multi-step stochastic denoising process, but their reliance on numerous sampling steps ($T \\gg 60$) makes them impractical for time-sensitive clinical applications like Crohn's Disease detection in Magnetic Resonance Enterography (MRE). DeFloMat replaces this slow stochastic path with a highly direct, deterministic flow field derived from Conditional Optimal Transport (OT) theory, specifically approximating the Rectified Flow. This shift enables fast inference via a simple Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) solver. We demonstrate the superiority of DeFloMat on a challenging MRE clinical dataset. Crucially, DeFloMat achieves state-of-the-art accuracy ($43.32\\% \\text{ } AP_{10:50}$) in only $3$ inference steps, which represents a $1.4\\times$ performance improvement over DiffusionDet's maximum converged performance ($31.03\\% \\text{ } AP_{10:50}$ at $4$ steps). Furthermore, our deterministic flow significantly enhances localization characteristics, yielding superior Recall and stability in the few-step regime. DeFloMat resolves the trade-off between generative accuracy and clinical efficiency, setting a new standard for stable and rapid object localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDeFloMat\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u66ff\u6362\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u6570\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u867d\u7136\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u654f\u611f\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5982MRE\u4e2d\u7684\u514b\u7f57\u6069\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u9700\u5feb\u901f\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06DiffusionDet\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u968f\u673a\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u7531\u6761\u4ef6\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7406\u8bba\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6d41\u573a\uff08\u8fd1\u4f3cRectified Flow\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355ODE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08CFM\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u573a\u3002", "result": "\u5728MRE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDeFloMat\u5728\u4ec53\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4e0b\u8fbe\u621043.32% AP_{10:50}\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4DiffusionDet\u57284\u6b65\u6700\u9ad8\u4ec531.03%\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5c11\u6b65\u6570\u4e0b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "DeFloMat\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684MRE\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4ee5\u4ec53\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b043.32% AP_{10:50}\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eDiffusionDet\u57284\u6b65\u65f6\u768431.03%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5c11\u6b65\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ec\u56de\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Current event camera calibration methods typically involve using flashing patterns, reconstructing intensity images, and utilizing the features extracted from events. Existing methods are generally time-consuming and require manually placed calibration objects, which cannot meet the needs of rapidly changing scenarios. In this paper, we propose a line-based event camera calibration framework exploiting the geometric lines of commonly-encountered objects in man-made environments, e.g., doors, windows, boxes, etc. Different from previous methods, our method detects lines directly from event streams and leverages an event-line calibration model to generate the initial guess of camera parameters, which is suitable for both planar and non-planar lines.

However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u8003token\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u878d\u5408\uff08QDFNet\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5149\u5b66\u4e0eSAR\u878d\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5149\u5b66\u4e0eSAR\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u53ca\u6a21\u6001\u7f3a\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u878d\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u8003token\u8fed\u4ee3\u8bc4\u4f30\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff08DMQA\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u6001\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5206\u914d\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6743\u91cd\uff08OCNF\uff09", "result": "Proposes QDFNet for robust optical-SAR object detection under missing/corrupted modalities", "conclusion": "QDFNet\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08DMQA\uff09\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u878d\u5408\uff08OCNF\uff09\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u90e8\u5206\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u9000\u5316\u65f6\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

This simply means, if an object is on the right or left side of a user, the app makes a sinusoidal sound in a user's respective ear through ear/headphones. However, to indicate objects located directly in front, both the left and right earphones are rung simultaneously. These sound cues could easily help a visually impaired individual locate objects with the help of their smartphones and reduce the reliance on people in their surroundings, consequently making them more independent.

Indeed, the assets at these substations (e.g., transformers) are prone to disruption from many hazards, including hurricanes, flooding, earthquakes, and geomagnetically induced currents (GICs). As electrical grids are considered critical national infrastructure, any failure can have significant economic and public safety implications. To help prevent and mitigate these failures, it is thus essential that we identify key substation components to quantify vulnerability. Unfortunately, traditional manual mapping of substation infrastructure is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Therefore, an autonomous solution utilizing computer vision models is preferable, as it allows for greater convenience and efficiency. In this research paper, we train and compare the outputs of 3 models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, RF-DETR) on a manually labeled dataset of US substation images.

Pose-code-based frameworks such as CoMo map quantifiable pose attributes into discrete pose codes that support interpretable motion control, but their frame-wise representation struggles to capture subtle temporal dynamics and high-frequency details, often degrading reconstruction fidelity and local controllability. To address this limitation, we introduce pose-guided residual refinement for motion (PGR$^2$M), a hybrid representation that augments interpretable pose codes with residual codes learned via residual vector quantization (RVQ). A pose-guided RVQ tokenizer decomposes motion into pose latents that encode coarse global structure and residual latents that model fine-grained temporal variations. Residual dropout further discourages over-reliance on residuals, preserving the semantic alignment and editability of the pose codes. On top of this tokenizer, a base Transformer autoregressively predicts pose codes from text, and a refine Transformer predicts residual codes conditioned on text, pose codes, and quantization stage. Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show that PGR$^2$M improves Fr\u00e9chet inception distance and reconstruction metrics for both generation and editing compared with CoMo and recent diffusion- and tokenization-based baselines, while user studies confirm that it enables intuitive, structure-preserving motion edits.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91capose code\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6b8b\u5deecode\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5Transformer\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a83D\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709pose-code\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982CoMo\uff09\u56e0\u9010\u5e27\u8868\u793a\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u817b\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fapose-guided RVQ tokenizer\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u4f5c\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u7c97\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7684pose latents\u4e0e\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684residual latents\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528residual dropout\u9632\u6b62\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b\u5728\u5176\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5Transformer\uff1abase Transformer\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4bpose code\uff0crefine Transformer\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u3001pose code\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u6d4bresidual code\u3002", "result": "\u5728HumanML3D\u4e0eKIT-ML\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cPGR^2M\u5728FID\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8eCoMo\u53ca\u8fd1\u671f\u6269\u6563/\u5206\u8bcd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5176\u652f\u6301\u76f4\u89c2\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u7559\u826f\u597d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "conclusion": "PGR^2M\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684pose code\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u5f15\u5165\u6b8b\u5deecode\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7ea7\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u4e22\u5f03\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ec6\u8282\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u76843D\u52a8\u4f5c\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u3002"}}

However, significant challenges are posed by the fast, uneven propagation of shock waves and unstable testing conditions. To address these challenges, a novel framework is proposed that utilizes multiple event cameras to estimate the asymmetry of shock waves, leveraging its high-speed and high-dynamic range capabilities. Initially, a polar coordinate system is established, which encodes events to reveal shock wave propagation patterns, with adaptive region-of-interest (ROI) extraction through event offset calculations. Subsequently, shock wave front events are extracted using iterative slope analysis, exploiting the continuity of velocity changes. Finally, the geometric model of events and shock wave motion parameters is derived according to event-based optical imaging model, along with the 3D reconstruction model. Through the above process, multi-angle shock wave measurement, motion field reconstruction, and explosive equivalence inversion are achieved. The results of the speed measurement are compared with those of the pressure sensors and the empirical formula, revealing a maximum error of 5.20% and a minimum error of 0.06%.

These models rely mainly on text prompts for instruction-based editing and generation, but language often fails to capture users intended edit locations and fine-grained visual details. To this end, we propose two tasks: scribble-based editing and generation, that enables more flexible creation on graphical user interface (GUI) combining user textual, images, and freehand sketches. We introduce DreamOmni3, tackling two challenges: data creation and framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline includes two parts: scribble-based editing and generation. For scribble-based editing, we define four tasks: scribble and instruction-based editing, scribble and multimodal instruction-based editing, image fusion, and doodle editing. Based on DreamOmni2 dataset, we extract editable regions and overlay hand-drawn boxes, circles, doodles or cropped image to construct training data. For scribble-based generation, we define three tasks: scribble and instruction-based generation, scribble and multimodal instruction-based generation, and doodle generation, following similar data creation pipelines. For the framework, instead of using binary masks, which struggle with complex edits involving multiple scribbles, images, and instructions, we propose a joint input scheme that feeds both the original and scribbled source images into the model, using different colors to distinguish regions and simplify processing. By applying the same index and position encodings to both images, the model can precisely localize scribbled regions while maintaining accurate editing. Finally, we establish comprehensive benchmarks for these tasks to promote further research.

Our work introduces the first-ever radiomics-enhanced fused residual multiparametric 3D network (ReFRM3D) for brain tumor characterization, which is based on a 3D U-Net architecture and features multi-scale feature fusion, hybrid upsampling, and an extended residual skip mechanism.

Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance across the BraTS2019, BraTS2020, and BraTS2021 datasets, achieving high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 94.04%, 92.68%, and 93.64% for whole tumor (WT), enhancing tumor (ET), and tumor core (TC) respectively in BraTS2019; 94.09%, 92.91%, and 93.84% in BraTS2020; and 93.70%, 90.36%, and 92.13% in BraTS2021.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u589e\u5f3a\u76843D\u6b8b\u5dee\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ReFRM3D\uff09\u53ca\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5728BraTS\u591a\u9879\u6bd4\u8d5b\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u7ea690%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8DSC\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u8bca\u65ad\u5b58\u5728\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u53d8\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e3D U-Net\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u6784\u5efaReFRM3D\uff1a\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u6269\u5c55\u6b8b\u5dee\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\uff1b\u5206\u5272\u540e\u4ece\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\u63d0\u53d6\u5f71\u50cf\u7ec4\u5b66\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u80bf\u7624\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728BraTS2019/2020/2021\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5206\u5272DSC\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523094.04/92.68/93.64\uff08BraTS2019\u7684WT/ET/TC\uff09\uff0c94.09/92.91/93.84\uff08BraTS2020\uff09\uff0c93.70/90.36/92.13\uff08BraTS2021\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ReFRM3D\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u80bf\u7624\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684\u591a\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001MRI\u4e0a\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u80f6\u8d28\u7624\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728BraTS2019/2020/2021\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u9ad8DSC\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining.

In this work, we present a novel framework for personalized 3D talking head animation, namely \"PTalker\". This framework preserves speaking style through style disentanglement from audio and facial motion sequences and enhances lip-synchronization accuracy through a three-level alignment mechanism between audio and mesh modalities. Specifically, to effectively disentangle style and content, we design disentanglement constraints that encode driven audio and motion sequences into distinct style and content spaces to enhance speaking style representation. To improve lip-synchronization accuracy, we adopt a modality alignment mechanism incorporating three aspects: spatial alignment using Graph Attention Networks to capture vertex connectivity in the 3D mesh structure, temporal alignment using cross-attention to capture and synchronize temporal dependencies, and feature alignment by top-k bidirectional contrastive losses and KL divergence constraints to ensure consistency between speech and mesh modalities.

Existing methods employ the Jaccard similarity coefficient instead of the cosine distance to enhance the measurement accuracy. However, these methods introduce too many irrelevant nodes, producing Jaccard coefficients with limited discriminative power and adversely affecting clustering performance. To address this issue, we propose a prediction-driven Top-K Jaccard similarity coefficient that enhances the purity of neighboring nodes, thereby improving the reliability of similarity measurements. Nevertheless, accurately predicting the optimal number of neighbors (Top-K) remains challenging, leading to suboptimal clustering results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a Transformer-based prediction model that examines the relationships between the central node and its neighboring nodes near the Top-K to further enhance the reliability of similarity estimation. However, vanilla Transformer, when applied to predict relationships between nodes, often introduces noise due to their overemphasis on irrelevant feature relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a Sparse Differential Transformer (SDT), instead of the vanilla Transformer, to eliminate noise and enhance the model's anti-noise capabilities. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, such as MS-Celeb-1M, demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, outperforming existing methods and providing a more robust solution for face clustering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9884\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Top-K Jaccard\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5dee\u5206Transformer\uff08SDT\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u90bb\u5c45\u7eaf\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6d88\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u6539\u5584\u4eba\u8138\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f7f\u7528Jaccard\u7cfb\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f15\u5165\u8fc7\u591a\u65e0\u5173\u90bb\u5c45\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8fa8\u8bc6\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u8fdb\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u8138\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u90bb\u5c45\u7eaf\u5ea6\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u8138\u5d4c\u5165\u6784\u5efa\u521d\u59cb\u8fd1\u90bb\u96c6\u5408\uff1b2. \u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684Top-K Jaccard\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u90bb\u5c45\u7eaf\u5ea6\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1Transformer\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8282\u70b9\u4e0eTop-K\u90bb\u5c45\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b4. \u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u5dee\u5206Transformer\uff08SDT\uff09\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6297\u566a\u6027\uff1b5. \u5728MS-Celeb-1M\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4eba\u8138\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8Top-K Jaccard\u76f8\u4f3c\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5dee\u5206Transformer\uff08SDT\uff09\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u6297\u566a\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Top-K\u90bb\u5c45\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u5e76\u7b5b\u9009\u66f4\u7eaf\u51c0\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u65e0\u5173\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528SDT\u66ff\u4ee3vanilla Transformer\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u5bf9\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u6548\u679c\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728MS-Celeb-1M\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u6d4b\u9a71\u52a8Top-K Jaccard\u4e0eSDT\u8054\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u8138\u5d4c\u5165\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u90bb\u5c45\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u805a\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u3002"}}

Some results are being finalized and may be updated in a future revision.}", "summary": "\\noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

Video diffusion models, through their image-to-video generation capability, provide a promising foundation for such visual imagination. However, existing approaches are largely forward predictive, generating trajectories conditioned on the initial observation without explicit goal modeling, thus often leading to spatial drift and goal misalignment. To address these challenges, we propose Envision, a diffusion-based framework that performs visual planning for embodied agents. By explicitly constraining the generation with a goal image, our method enforces physical plausibility and goal consistency throughout the generated trajectory. Specifically, Envision operates in two stages. First, a Goal Imagery Model identifies task-relevant regions, performs region-aware cross attention between the scene and the instruction, and synthesizes a coherent goal image that captures the desired outcome.

Motivated by this, adapting RLHF for Image Super-Resolution (ISR) tasks has shown promise in optimizing perceptual quality with Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model as reward models. However, the traditional IQA model usually output a single global score, which are exceptionally insensitive to local and fine-grained distortions. This insensitivity allows ISR models to produce perceptually undesirable artifacts that yield spurious high scores, misaligning optimization objectives with perceptual quality and results in reward hacking. To address this, we propose a Fine-grained Perceptual Reward Model (FinPercep-RM) based on an Encoder-Decoder architecture. While providing a global quality score, it also generates a Perceptual Degradation Map that spatially localizes and quantifies local defects. We specifically introduce the FGR-30k dataset to train this model, consisting of diverse and subtle distortions from real-world super-resolution models. Despite the success of the FinPercep-RM model, its complexity introduces significant challenges in generator policy learning, leading to training instability. To address this, we propose a Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) mechanism, where both the reward model and the ISR model undergo synchronized curricula. The reward model progressively increases in complexity, while the ISR model starts with a simpler global reward for rapid convergence, gradually transitioning to the more complex model outputs. This easy-to-hard strategy enables stable training while suppressing reward hacking. Experiments validates the effectiveness of our method across ISR models in both global quality and local realism on RLHF methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578bFinPercep-RM\u4e0eFGR-30k\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u8fdb\u5316\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CCL\uff09\u7f13\u89e3\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e0e\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\uff0c\u63d0\u5347ISR\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "Adapt RLHF to Image Super-Resolution (ISR) to optimize perceptual quality, addressing limitations of global-scoring IQA reward models that miss local distortions leading to reward hacking.", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1Encoder-Decoder\u7684FinPercep-RM\u8f93\u51fa\u5168\u5c40\u5206\u6570\u4e0ePerceptual Degradation Map\uff1b\u6784\u5efaFGR-30k\u542b\u7ec6\u5fae\u771f\u5b9e\u5931\u771f\uff1b\u63d0\u51faCCL\u673a\u5236\u4f7f\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5668\u540c\u6b65\u4ece\u6613\u5230\u96be\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "Propose FinPercep-RM encoder-decoder reward model producing global score and Perceptual Degradation Map; introduce FGR-30k dataset; propose Co-evolutionary Curriculum Learning (CCL) to stabilize training and suppress reward hacking; experiments show improved global quality and local realism.", "conclusion": "FinPercep-RM\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5c40\u90e8\u7f3a\u9677\uff0cCCL\u901a\u8fc7\u6613\u5230\u96be\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u7a33\u5b9aRLHF\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u52ab\u6301\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728ISR\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies.

However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively.

To evaluate our model, we develop benchmarks for evaluating the ability of motion prediction models to predict human and robot motion.

Nonrigid registration algorithms exhibit tradeoffs between their accuracy, the computational complexity of their deformation model, and its proper regularization. In addition, they also assume intensity correlation in anatomically homologous regions of interest among image pairs, limiting their applicability to the monomodal setting. Unlike learning-based models, we propose an instance-specific framework that is not subject to high scan requirements for training and does not suffer performance degradation at inference time on modalities unseen during training. Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries.

With better training data that is diverse and covers a wide range of situations, including long-tailed driving scenarios, autonomous driving models can become more robust and safer. This motivates a unified simulation framework that can jointly handle realistic integration of inserted 3D assets and NVS. Recent 3D asset reconstruction methods enable reconstruction of dynamic actors from video, supporting their re-insertion into simulated driving scenes. While the overall structure and appearance can be accurate, it still struggles to capture the realism of 3D assets through lighting or shadows, particularly when inserted into scenes. In parallel, recent advances in NVS methods have demonstrated promising results in synthesizing viewpoints beyond the originally recorded trajectories. However, existing approaches largely treat asset insertion and NVS capabilities in isolation. To allow for interaction with the rest of the scene and to enable more diverse creation of new scenarios for training, realistic 3D asset insertion should be combined with NVS. To address this, we present SCPainter (Street Car Painter), a unified framework which integrates 3D Gaussian Splat (GS) car asset representations and 3D scene point clouds with diffusion-based generation to jointly enable realistic 3D asset insertion and NVS. The 3D GS assets and 3D scene point clouds are projected together into novel views, and these projections are used to condition a diffusion model to generate high quality images.

Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map.

Although effective, we observe that such similarity distributions across grades usually exhibit multimodal patterns. For instance, an image embedding may show high similarity to both \"excellent\" and \"poor\" grade descriptions while deviating from the \"good\" one. We refer to this phenomenon as \"semantic drift\", where semantic inconsistencies between text embeddings and their intended descriptions undermine the reliability of text-image shared-space learning. To mitigate this issue, we draw inspiration from psychometrics and propose an improved Graded Response Model (GRM) for AGIQA. The GRM is a classical assessment model that categorizes a subject's ability across grades using test items with various difficulty levels. This paradigm aligns remarkably well with human quality rating, where image quality can be interpreted as an image's ability to meet various quality grades. Building on this philosophy, we design a two-branch quality grading module: one branch estimates image ability while the other constructs multiple difficulty levels. To ensure monotonicity in difficulty levels, we further model difficulty generation in an arithmetic manner, which inherently enforces a unimodal and interpretable quality distribution. Our Arithmetic GRM based Quality Grading (AGQG) module enjoys a plug-and-play advantage, consistently improving performance when integrated into various state-of-the-art AGIQA frameworks.

Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face significant image quality degradation under a low-latency budget, primarily due to accumulated truncation errors arising from the inability to capture high-curvature trajectory segments. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel Direction solver (dubbed as EPD-Solver), a novel ODE solver that mitigates these errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in each step. Motivated by the geometric insight that sampling trajectories are largely confined to a low-dimensional manifold, EPD-Solver leverages the Mean Value Theorem for vector-valued functions to approximate the integral solution more accurately. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling nature. We introduce a two-stage optimization framework. Initially, EPD-Solver optimizes a small set of learnable parameters via a distillation-based approach. We further propose a parameter-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) fine-tuning scheme that reformulates the solver as a stochastic Dirichlet policy. Unlike traditional methods that fine-tune the massive backbone, our RL approach operates strictly within the low-dimensional solver space, effectively mitigating reward hacking while enhancing performance in complex text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks.

Existing methods, however, are typically limited to local search, making them prone to failures under viewpoint changes, occlusions, and rapid target movements. In this work, we introduce the first global tracking framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (VPTracker), exploiting their powerful semantic reasoning to locate targets across the entire image space. While global search improves robustness and reduces drift, it also introduces distractions from visually or semantically similar objects. To address this, we propose a location-aware visual prompting mechanism that incorporates spatial priors into the MLLM. Specifically, we construct a region-level prompt based on the target's previous location, enabling the model to prioritize region-level recognition and resort to global inference only when necessary.

However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation.

However, while extensively studied in indoor settings, its zero-shot generalization to open-world domains lags far behind perspective images, which benefit from abundant training data. This disparity makes transferring capabilities from the perspective domain an attractive solution. To bridge this gap, we present Depth Anything in $360^\\circ$ (DA360), a panoramic-adapted version of Depth Anything V2. Our key innovation involves learning a shift parameter from the ViT backbone, transforming the model's scale- and shift-invariant output into a scale-invariant estimate that directly yields well-formed 3D point clouds.

Evaluated on standard indoor benchmarks and our newly curated outdoor dataset, Metropolis, DA360 shows substantial gains over its base model, achieving over 50\\% and 10\\% relative depth error reduction on indoor and outdoor benchmarks, respectively.

Existing interpretable SR approaches, whether based on prior learning or deep unfolding optimization frameworks, typically rely on black-box deep networks to model latent variables, which leaves the degradation process largely unknown and uncontrollable. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem (KAT), we for the first time propose a novel interpretable operator, termed Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), with the application to image SR. KANO provides a transparent and structured representation of the latent degradation fitting process. Specifically, we employ an additive structure composed of a finite number of B-spline functions to approximate continuous spectral curves in a piecewise fashion. By learning and optimizing the shape parameters of these spline functions within defined intervals, our KANO accurately captures key spectral characteristics, such as local linear trends and the peak-valley structures at nonlinear inflection points, thereby endowing SR results with physical interpretability. Furthermore, through theoretical modeling and experimental evaluations across natural images, aerial photographs, and satellite remote sensing data, we systematically compare multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) in handling complex sequence fitting tasks.

The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets.

However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRCM-cache\uff08\u76f8\u5bf9\u5750\u6807\u56fe\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u63a7\u52366-DoF\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6e10\u8fdb\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u624b\u7f51\u683c\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5728ID\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709HOI\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5dee\u548c\u5bf9\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u6807\u6ce8\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528DiT\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u9aa8\u5e72\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u4e3aRCM-cache\uff1a\u7528Relative Coordinate Maps\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u6ce8\u5165\u7269\u4f53\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u5e76\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u52366-DoF\u7269\u4f53\u4f4d\u59ff\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u548c3D\u7269\u4f53\u8f93\u5165\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4ee5\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u653e\u5bbd\u5bf9\u624b\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "ByteLoom\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDiffusion Transformer (DiT) \u7684HOI\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165RCM-cache\u673a\u5236\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4eba\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e73\u6ed1\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u624b\u90e8\u7f51\u683c\u6ce8\u91ca\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u80fd\u5728HOI\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, existing social navigation datasets often lack explicit reasoning supervision and exhibit highly long-tailed action distributions, limiting models' ability to learn safety-critical behaviors. To address these issues, we introduce MUSON, a multimodal dataset for short-horizon social navigation collected across diverse indoor and outdoor campus scenes. MUSON adopts a structured five-step Chain-of-Thought annotation consisting of perception, prediction, reasoning, action, and explanation, with explicit modeling of static physical constraints and a rationally balanced discrete action space. Compared to SNEI, MUSON provides consistent reasoning, action, and explanation. Benchmarking multiple state-of-the-art Small Vision Language Models on MUSON shows that Qwen2.5-VL-3B achieves the highest decision accuracy of 0.8625, demonstrating that MUSON serves as an effective and reusable benchmark for socially compliant navigation.

Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes, or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g., simplicity of bias). However, these methods may yield unsatisfactory performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper, we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently, we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spurious features based on a simple grouping strategy. Then, we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spurious features by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally, we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on erasing concepts from text prompts, overlooking other input modalities that are increasingly critical in real-world applications such as image editing and personalized generation. These modalities can become attack surfaces, where erased concepts re-emerge despite defenses. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-ErasureBench, a novel multimodal evaluation framework that systematically benchmarks concept erasure methods across three input modalities: text prompts, learned embeddings, and inverted latents. For the latter two, we evaluate both white-box and black-box access, yielding five evaluation scenarios. Our analysis shows that existing methods achieve strong erasure performance against text prompts but largely fail under learned embeddings and inverted latents, with Concept Reproduction Rate (CRR) exceeding 90% in the white-box setting. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose IRECE (Inference-time Robustness Enhancement for Concept Erasure), a plug-and-play module that localizes target concepts via cross-attention and perturbs the associated latents during denoising. Experiments demonstrate that IRECE consistently restores robustness, reducing CRR by up to 40% under the most challenging white-box latent inversion scenario, while preserving visual quality. To the best of our knowledge, M-ErasureBench provides the first comprehensive benchmark of concept erasure beyond text prompts. Together with IRECE, our benchmark offers practical safeguards for building more reliable protective generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u9996\u4e2a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6982\u5ff5\u62b9\u9664\u57fa\u51c6M-ErasureBench\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63d2\u4ef6IRECE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e76\u6270\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u62b9\u9664\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u62b9\u9664\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u7b49\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u653b\u51fb\u9762\u4f7f\u62b9\u9664\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM-ErasureBench\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e94\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u8106\u5f31\u70b9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63d2\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757IRECE\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u5bf9\u5e94\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u65bd\u52a0\u6270\u52a8\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u73b0\u3002", "result": "M-ErasureBench\u663e\u793a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u767d\u76d2\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u4e0bCRR>90%\uff1b\u5f15\u5165IRECE\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u573a\u666fCRR\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u591a40%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6982\u5ff5\u62b9\u9664\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u62b9\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u88ab\u62b9\u9664\u6982\u5ff5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u6001\u4e0b\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6M-ErasureBench\uff0c\u8986\u76d6\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u53cd\u6f14\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u53ca\u4e94\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u767d\u76d2\uff09\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u6982\u5ff5\u91cd\u73b0\u7387\uff08CRR\uff09\u8d85\u8fc790%\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51faIRECE\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u5e76\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6270\u52a8\u76f8\u5173\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5c06CRR\u5728\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u7684\u767d\u76d2\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u964d\u6700\u591a40%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": ""}}

However, their effectiveness is critically limited when combined with standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). We identify a fundamental limitation: CFG's extrapolative nature systematically pushes the sampling path off the data manifold, causing the approximation error to diverge and undermining the refinement process. To address this, we propose Guided Path Sampling (GPS), a new paradigm for iterative refinement. GPS replaces unstable extrapolation with a principled, manifold-constrained interpolation, ensuring the sampling path remains on the data manifold. We theoretically prove that this correction transforms the error series from unbounded amplification to strictly bounded, guaranteeing stability. Furthermore, we devise an optimal scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts guidance strength, aligning semantic injection with the model's natural coarse-to-fine generation process.

Traditional modular pipelines separate perception, prediction, and planning, while recent end-to-end (E2E) systems learn them jointly.

We propose ColaVLA, a unified vision-language-action framework that transfers reasoning from text to a unified latent space and couples it with a hierarchical, parallel trajectory decoder. The Cognitive Latent Reasoner compresses scene understanding into compact, decision-oriented meta-action embeddings through ego-adaptive selection and only two VLM forward passes. The Hierarchical Parallel Planner then generates multi-scale, causality-consistent trajectories in a single forward pass.

Existing detection methods typically allocate computational resources uniformly, failing to adaptively focus on these density-concentrated regions, which hinders feature learning effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Dense Region Mining Network (DRMNet), which leverages density maps as explicit spatial priors to guide adaptive feature learning. First, we design a Density Generation Branch (DGB) to model object distribution patterns, providing quantifiable priors that guide the network toward dense regions. Second, to address the computational bottleneck of global attention, our Dense Area Focusing Module (DAFM) uses these density maps to identify and focus on dense areas, enabling efficient local-global feature interaction.

However, its inherent sparsity and limited semantic richness significantly constrain perception capability. Recently, fusing camera data with 4D radar has emerged as a promising cost effective solution, by exploiting the complementary strengths of the two modalities. Nevertheless, point-cloud-based radar often suffer from information loss introduced by multi-stage signal processing, while directly utilizing raw 4D radar data incurs prohibitive computational costs.

We further introduce a two-stage query-based, modality-agnostic fusion mechanism termed Geometry-guided Progressive Fusion to efficiently integrate multi-view features from both modalities.

Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faYOLO-IOD\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3YOLO-World\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u589e\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u6807\u6ce8\u7cbe\u70bc\u3001\u91cd\u8981\u5377\u79ef\u6838\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u8de8\u9636\u6bb5\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u84b8\u998f\u7f13\u89e3\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u7684LoCo COCO\u57fa\u51c6", "motivation": "alleviate catastrophic forgetting in real-time YOLO-based incremental object detection by identifying and addressing three conflict types: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation", "method": "stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained YOLO-World model", "result": "proposed YOLO-IOD with CPR, IKS, CAKD components and LoCo COCO benchmark; shows superior performance and minimal forgetting on conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks", "conclusion": "YOLO-IOD\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51b2\u7a81\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u6807\u6ce8\u7cbe\u70bc\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u6838\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u8de8\u9636\u6bb5\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11YOLO\u589e\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose ReamCamo, a unified out-painting based framework for realistic camouflaged image generation. ReamCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multi-modal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images.

To address this gap, we propose PoseStreamer, a robust multi-modal 6DoF pose estimation framework designed specifically on high-speed moving scenarios. Our approach integrates three core components: an Adaptive Pose Memory Queue that utilizes historical orientation cues for temporal consistency, an Object-centric 2D Tracker that provides strong 2D priors to boost 3D center recall, and a Ray Pose Filter for geometric refinement along camera rays. Furthermore, we introduce MoCapCube6D, a novel multi-modal dataset constructed to benchmark performance under rapid motion.

However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text \"in the left lower lung\", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks.

Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

In contrast, most computational object recognition systems operate on isolated image regions, devoid of meaning in isolation, thus ignoring this vital contextual information. This paper argues for the critical role of context and introduces a novel framework for contextual object classification. We first construct a Geo-Semantic Contextual Graph (GSCG) from a single monocular image. This rich, structured representation is built by integrating a metric depth estimator with a unified panoptic and material segmentation model. The GSCG encodes objects as nodes with detailed geometric, chromatic, and material attributes, and their spatial relationships as edges. This explicit graph structure makes the model's reasoning process inherently interpretable. We then propose a specialized graph-based classifier that aggregates features from a target object, its immediate neighbors, and the global scene context to predict its class.

We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON.

In this work, we propose Co2S, a stable semi-supervised RS segmentation framework that synergistically fuses priors from vision-language models and self-supervised models. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous dual-student architecture comprising two distinct ViT-based vision foundation models initialized with pretrained CLIP and DINOv3 to mitigate error accumulation and pseudo-label drift. To effectively incorporate these distinct priors, an explicit-implicit semantic co-guidance mechanism is introduced that utilizes text embeddings and learnable queries to provide explicit and implicit class-level guidance, respectively, thereby jointly enhancing semantic consistency. Furthermore, a global-local feature collaborative fusion strategy is developed to effectively fuse the global contextual information captured by CLIP with the local details produced by DINOv3, enabling the model to generate highly precise segmentation results. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, which consistently achieves leading performance across various partition protocols and diverse scenarios.

In this work, we investigate whether 3D representations can be learned from unlabeled videos recorded without any real 3D sensors. We present Laplacian-Aware Multi-level 3D Clustering with Sinkhorn-Knopp (LAM3C), a self-supervised framework that learns from video-generated point clouds from unlabeled videos. We first introduce RoomTours, a video-generated point cloud dataset constructed by collecting room-walkthrough videos from the web (e.g., real-estate tours) and generating 49,219 scenes using an off-the-shelf feed-forward reconstruction model.

However, while textual and static multimodal agents have seen rapid progress, a significant modality gap remains in processing the web's most dynamic modality: video. Existing video benchmarks predominantly focus on passive perception, feeding curated clips to models without requiring external retrieval. They fail to evaluate agentic video research, which necessitates actively interrogating video timelines, cross-referencing dispersed evidence, and verifying claims against the open web. To bridge this gap, we present \\textbf{Video-BrowseComp}, a challenging benchmark comprising 210 questions tailored for open-web agentic video reasoning. Unlike prior benchmarks, Video-BrowseComp enforces a mandatory dependency on temporal visual evidence, ensuring that answers cannot be derived solely through text search but require navigating video timelines to verify external claims. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals a critical bottleneck: even advanced search-augmented models like GPT-5.1 (w/ Search) achieve only 15.24\\% accuracy. Our analysis reveals that these models largely rely on textual proxies, excelling in metadata-rich domains (e.g., TV shows with plot summaries) but collapsing in metadata-sparse, dynamic environments (e.g., sports, gameplay) where visual grounding is essential.

Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context.

Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes.

However, learning-based models are widely believed to be sensitive to domain shift, with robustness typically pursued through large and diverse training datasets, without explaining the underlying mechanisms. In this work, we show that domain-shift immunity is an inherent property of deep deformable registration models, arising from their reliance on local feature representations rather than global appearance for deformation estimation. To isolate and validate this mechanism, we introduce UniReg, a universal registration framework that decouples feature extraction from deformation estimation using fixed, pre-trained feature extractors and a UNet-based deformation network. Despite training on a single dataset, UniReg exhibits robust cross-domain and multi-modal performance comparable to optimization-based methods. Our analysis further reveals that failures of conventional CNN-based models under modality shift originate from dataset-induced biases in early convolutional layers.

Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.

Existing image-based approaches face two critical challenges: methods achieving high accuracy typically require dense 3D supervision, while those operating without such supervision struggle to extract accurate geometry from images alone. In this paper, we present GVSynergy-Det, a novel framework that enhances 3D detection through synergistic Gaussian-Voxel representation learning. Our key insight is that continuous Gaussian and discrete voxel representations capture complementary geometric information: Gaussians excel at modeling fine-grained surface details while voxels provide structured spatial context. We introduce a dual-representation architecture that: 1) adapts generalizable Gaussian Splatting to extract complementary geometric features for detection tasks, and 2) develops a cross-representation enhancement mechanism that enriches voxel features with geometric details from Gaussian fields. Unlike previous methods that either rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization or utilize Gaussian representations solely for depth regularization, our synergistic strategy directly leverages features from both representations through learnable integration, enabling more accurate object localization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GVSynergy-Det achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging indoor benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods on both ScanNetV2 and ARKitScenes datasets, all without requiring any depth or dense 3D geometry supervision (e.g., point clouds or TSDF).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGVSynergy-Det\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u9ad8\u65af-\u4f53\u7d20\u53cc\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u5347\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u5efa\u6a21\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u878d\u5408\u4e92\u8865\u63d0\u5347\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216\u7a20\u5bc6\u4e09\u7ef4\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5728ScanNetV2\u548cARKitScenes\u4e0a\u8fbeSOTA\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u4ec5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u7a20\u5bc63D\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u7cbe\u786e\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u800c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a20\u5bc6\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u7a20\u5bc6\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u8868\u793a\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u5c06\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u70b9\u6269\u6563\uff08Gaussian Splatting\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u4eceRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u6784\u5efa\u4f53\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8de8\u8868\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u573a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u6ce8\u5165\u4f53\u7d20\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u7279\u5f81\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7528\u4e8e3D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u5728ScanNetV2\u4e0eARKitScenes\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cGVSynergy-Det\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u70b9\u4e91\u6216TSDF\u7b49\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e09\u7ef4\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u78403D\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u63a5\u8fd1SOTA\u3002", "conclusion": "GVSynergy-Det\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u6216\u7a20\u5bc6\u4e09\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0e\u4f53\u7d20\u53cc\u8868\u793a\u4e92\u8865\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5ba4\u5185\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7840\u76843D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728ScanNetV2\u4e0eARKitScenes\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

However, existing DWMs lack 3D scene understanding capabilities and can only generate content conditioned on input data, without the ability to interpret or reason about the driving environment. Moreover, current approaches represent 3D spatial information with point cloud or BEV features do not accurately align textual information with the underlying 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel unified DWM framework based on 3D Gaussian scene representation, which enables both 3D scene understanding and multi-modal scene generation, while also enabling contextual enrichment for understanding and generation tasks. Our approach directly aligns textual information with the 3D scene by embedding rich linguistic features into each Gaussian primitive, thereby achieving early modality alignment. In addition, we design a novel task-aware language-guided sampling strategy that removes redundant 3D Gaussians and injects accurate and compact 3D tokens into LLM. Furthermore, we design a dual-condition multi-modal generation model, where the information captured by our vision-language model is leveraged as a high-level language condition in combination with a low-level image condition, jointly guiding the multi-modal generation process. We conduct comprehensive studies on the nuScenes, and NuInteract datasets to validate the effectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting.

Current diffusion model-based applications exploit the power of learned visual representations from multistep forward-backward Markovian processes for single-task prediction tasks by attaching a task-specific decoder. However, the heuristic selection of diffusion timestep features still heavily relies on empirical intuition, often leading to sub-optimal performance biased towards certain tasks. To alleviate this constraint, we investigate the significance of versatile diffusion timestep features by adaptively selecting timesteps best suited for the few-shot dense prediction task, evaluated on an arbitrary unseen task. To this end, we propose two modules: Task-aware Timestep Selection (TTS) to select ideal diffusion timesteps based on timestep-wise losses and similarity scores, and Timestep Feature Consolidation (TFC) to consolidate the selected timestep features to improve the dense predictive performance in a few-shot setting. Accompanied by our parameter-efficient fine-tuning adapter, our framework effectively achieves superiority in dense prediction performance given only a few support queries.

We argue that these two tasks should be unified within a single framework, as logical reasoning and imaginative thinking are both fundamental qualities of a film director. In this work, we propose UniMAGE, a unified director model that bridges user prompts with well-structured scripts, thereby empowering non-experts to produce long-context, multi-shot films by leveraging existing audio-video generation models. To achieve this, we employ the Mixture-of-Transformers architecture that unifies text and image generation. To further enhance narrative logic and keyframe consistency, we introduce a ``first interleaving, then disentangling'' training paradigm. Specifically, we first perform Interleaved Concept Learning, which utilizes interleaved text-image data to foster the model's deeper understanding and imaginative interpretation of scripts. We then conduct Disentangled Expert Learning, which decouples script writing from keyframe generation, enabling greater flexibility and creativity in storytelling.

Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance.

By mitigating noise induced errors during the critical early and middle sampling stages, SGPS enables more accurate posterior sampling and reduces error accumulation.

We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet). First, we introduce the Gas Block, a diffusion-convection unit modeling gas transport: a local branch captures short-range variations, while a large-kernel branch captures long-range propagation. An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries.

However, these models rely on large amounts of globally representative data, which often contain redundancy, noise, and class imbalance, reducing training efficiency and preventing convergence. Existing RS diffusion foundation models typically aggregate multiple classification datasets or apply simplistic deduplication, overlooking the distributional requirements of generation modeling and the heterogeneity of RS imagery. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free, two-stage data pruning approach that quickly select a high-quality subset under high pruning ratios, enabling a preliminary foundation model to converge rapidly and serve as a versatile backbone for generation, downstream fine-tuning, and other applications. Our method jointly considers local information content with global scene-level diversity and representativeness. First, an entropy-based criterion efficiently removes low-information samples. Next, leveraging RS scene classification datasets as reference benchmarks, we perform scene-aware clustering with stratified sampling to improve clustering effectiveness while reducing computational costs on large-scale unlabeled data. Finally, by balancing cluster-level uniformity and sample representativeness, the method enables fine-grained selection under high pruning ratios while preserving overall diversity and representativeness. Experiments show that, even after pruning 85\\% of the training data, our method significantly improves convergence and generation quality. Furthermore, diffusion foundation models trained with our method consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks, including super-resolution and semantic image synthesis.

To address the deficiencies of existing methods, including the failure of fixed resolutions to balance efficiency and detail, as well as the lack of semantic hierarchy in single-scale alignment, this study proposes a Vision-language Model (VLM) framework integrated with two key innovations: the Dynamic Resolution Input Strategy (DRIS) and the Multi-scale Vision-language Alignment Mechanism (MS-VLAM).Specifically, the DRIS adopts a coarse-to-fine approach to adaptively allocate computational resources according to the complexity of image content, thereby preserving key fine-grained features while reducing redundant computational overhead. The MS-VLAM constructs a three-tier alignment mechanism covering object, local-region and global levels, which systematically captures cross-modal semantic consistency and alleviates issues of semantic misalignment and granularity imbalance.Experimental results on the RS-GPT4V dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the accuracy of semantic understanding and computational efficiency in tasks including image captioning and cross-modal retrieval. Compared with conventional methods, it achieves superior performance in evaluation metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr for image captioning, as well as R@10 for cross-modal retrieval.

Although recent multimodal and vision-language model (VLM)-based approaches enhance semantic understanding of change regions by incorporating textual descriptions, they still suffer from challenges such as inaccurate spatial localization, imprecise pixel-level boundary delineation, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map.

However, generating a sequence of images while preserving consistent character identity across diverse scene descriptions remains a challenging task. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between maintaining identity consistency and ensuring per-image prompt alignment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, ASemconsist, that addresses this challenge through selective text embedding modification, enabling explicit semantic control over character identity without sacrificing prompt alignment. Furthermore, based on our analysis of padding embeddings in FLUX, we propose a semantic control strategy that repurposes padding embeddings as semantic containers. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive feature-sharing strategy that automatically evaluates textual ambiguity and applies constraints only to the ambiguous identity prompt. Finally, we propose a unified evaluation protocol, the Consistency Quality Score (CQS), which integrates identity preservation and per-image text alignment into a single comprehensive metric, explicitly capturing performance imbalances between the two metrics. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively overcoming prior trade-offs.

Recently, Gaussian Splatting has emerged as an efficient representation framework, and its extension to 2D image representation enables lightweight, yet expressive modeling of visual content. While recent 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) approaches provide compact storage and real-time decoding, they often produce blurry or indistinct boundaries when the number of Gaussians is small due to the lack of contour awareness. In this work, we propose a Contour Information-Aware 2D Gaussian Splatting framework that incorporates object segmentation priors into Gaussian-based image representation. By constraining each Gaussian to a specific segmentation region during rasterization, our method prevents cross-boundary blending and preserves edge structures under high compression. We also introduce a warm-up scheme to stabilize training and improve convergence.

Caching-based methods achieve training-free acceleration, while suffering from considerable computational error. Existing methods typically incorporate error correction strategies such as pruning or prediction to mitigate it. However, their fixed caching strategy fails to adapt to the complex error variations during denoising, which limits the full potential of error correction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel fidelity-optimization plugin for existing error correction methods via cumulative error minimization, named CEM. CEM predefines the error to characterize the sensitivity of model to acceleration jointly influenced by timesteps and cache intervals. Guided by this prior, we formulate a dynamic programming algorithm with cumulative error approximation for strategy optimization, which achieves the caching error minimization, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation fidelity. CEM is model-agnostic and exhibits strong generalization, which is adaptable to arbitrary acceleration budgets.

However, these models rely on static dense computation that applies uniform processing to all inputs, misallocating representational capacity and computational resources such as over-allocating on trivial scenes while under-serving complex ones. This mismatch results in both computational redundancy and suboptimal detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose YOLO-Master, a novel YOLO-like framework that introduces instance-conditional adaptive computation for RTOD. This is achieved through a Efficient Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (ES-MoE) block that dynamically allocates computational resources to each input according to its scene complexity. At its core, a lightweight dynamic routing network guides expert specialization during training through a diversity enhancing objective, encouraging complementary expertise among experts. Additionally, the routing network adaptively learns to activate only the most relevant experts, thereby improving detection performance while minimizing computational overhead during inference. Comprehensive experiments on five large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of YOLO-Master. On MS COCO, our model achieves 42.4% AP with 1.62ms latency, outperforming YOLOv13-N by +0.8% mAP and 17.8% faster inference. Notably, the gains are most pronounced on challenging dense scenes, while the model preserves efficiency on typical inputs and maintains real-time inference speed.

This study presents a critical comparison between two fundamentally different AI architectures: the specialized open-source agent MedGemma and the proprietary large multimodal model GPT-4 for diagnosing six different diseases. The MedGemma-4b-it model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), demonstrated superior diagnostic capability by achieving a mean test accuracy of 80.37% compared to 69.58% for the untuned GPT-4.

Moreover, the reliance on text or image-based inputs often requires significant manual annotation, limiting their scalability and applicability in industrial settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Heterogeneous Collaborative Multi-Expert Reinforcement Learning (CME-CAD) paradigm, a novel training paradigm for CAD code generation.

We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u5e94\u89c6\u4e3a\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3a\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u5224\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u80fd\u505a\u62d3\u6251\u6539\u53d8\uff08\u5148\u5c55\u5f00\u518d\u584c\u7f29\uff09\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f55\u89c6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5224\u522b\u6027\u6216\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76d1\u7763\u5e76\u4e3a\u4f55\u67d0\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u62bd\u8c61\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\u8054\u7cfb\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u62d3\u6251\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u89c6\u89d2\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u8bed\u4e49\u72b6\u6001\u79bb\u6563\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u6027\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5448\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b\u5206\u6790\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u5b50\u6d41\u5f62\u6027\u8d28\u53ca\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u6269\u5c55-\u94a9\u5408\u201d\u673a\u5236\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8868\u5f81\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u793a\u610f\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u9700\u8981\u8bed\u4e49\u8bed\u8a00\uff0c\u89c2\u6d4b\u7a7a\u95f4\u5448\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e1b\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e3a\u5546\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u5728\u7ea4\u7ef4\u4e0a\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5f97\u5230\u4e24\u70b9\u7406\u8bba\u540e\u679c\uff1a1) \u8bed\u4e49\u5546X/G\u4e0d\u662fX\u7684\u5b50\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u9700\u975e\u540c\u80da\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u6807\u7b7e\u7b49\uff09\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff1b2) \u6a21\u578b\u9700\u652f\u6301\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5373\u201c\u6269\u5c55-\u94a9\u5408\u201d\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u4e0e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5224\u522b/\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c4\u5f8b\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u9760\u5e73\u6ed1\u53d8\u5f62\u6216\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8fde\u7eed\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5224\u522b\u6027\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u53ef\u8fdb\u884c\u62d3\u6251\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u8be5\u62d3\u6251\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4f55\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u3001\u8de8\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

While existing methods allow users to describe the target object with text and visual examples, the visual examples must be manually annotated inside the image, and there is no way to specify what not to count. To address these gaps, we introduce novel capabilities that expand how the target object can be specified. Specifically, we extend the prompt to enable what not to count to be described with text and/or visual examples, introduce the concept of `pseudo-exemplars' that automate the annotation of visual examples at inference, and extend counting models to accept visual examples from both natural and synthetic external images.

However, existing approaches often rely on pre-constructed 3D representations or off-the-shelf reconstruction pipelines, which constrain scalability and real-world applicability. A recent line of work explores learning spatial reasoning directly from multi-view images, enabling Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand 3D scenes without explicit 3D reconstructions. Nevertheless, key challenges that frequently arise in real-world environments, such as partial visibility, occlusion, and low-overlap conditions that require spatial reasoning from fragmented visual cues, remain under-explored. To address these limitations, we propose a scalable multi-view data generation and annotation pipeline that constructs realistic spatial reasoning QAs, resulting in SpatialMosaic, a comprehensive instruction-tuning dataset featuring 2M QA pairs. We further introduce SpatialMosaic-Bench, a challenging benchmark for evaluating multi-view spatial reasoning under realistic and challenging scenarios, consisting of 1M QA pairs across 6 tasks. In addition, we present SpatialMosaicVLM, a hybrid framework that integrates 3D reconstruction models as geometry encoders within VLMs for robust spatial reasoning.

However, existing methods have limitations in local geometric modeling and cross-stage information optimization, which make it difficult to accurately capture the geometric constraints of matched pairs and thus reduce the robustness of the model. To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-Graph Contextual Attention Network (MGCA-Net), which consists of a Contextual Geometric Attention (CGA) module and a Cross-Stage Multi-Graph Consensus (CSMGC) module. Specifically, CGA dynamically integrates spatial position and feature information via an adaptive attention mechanism and enhances the capability to capture both local and global geometric relationships. Meanwhile, CSMGC establishes geometric consensus via a cross-stage sparse graph network, ensuring the consistency of geometric information across different stages. Experimental results on two representative YFCC100M and SUN3D datasets show that MGCA-Net significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in the outlier rejection and camera pose estimation tasks.

Current IMDL research typically uses cross-dataset evaluation, where models trained on one benchmark are tested on others. However, this simplified evaluation approach conceals the fragility of existing methods when handling diverse AI-generated content, leading to misleading impressions of progress. This paper challenges this illusion by proposing NeXT-IMDL, a large-scale diagnostic benchmark designed not just to collect data, but to probe the generalization boundaries of current detectors systematically. Specifically, NeXT-IMDL categorizes AIGC-based manipulations along four fundamental axes: editing models, manipulation types, content semantics, and forgery granularity. Built upon this, NeXT-IMDL implements five rigorous cross-dimension evaluation protocols. Our extensive experiments on 11 representative models reveal a critical insight: while these models perform well in their original settings, they exhibit systemic failures and significant performance degradation when evaluated under our designed protocols that simulate real-world, various generalization scenarios.

Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \\textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \\textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail.

Native 3D methods relying on geometric cues often suffer from boundary leakage, center drift, and inconsistent tooth identities, especially for minority classes and complex anatomies. Meanwhile, 2D foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide strong boundary-aware semantics, but directly applying them in 3D is impractical in clinical workflows. To address these issues, we propose SOFTooth, a semantics-enhanced, order-aware 2D-3D fusion framework that leverages frozen 2D semantics without explicit 2D mask supervision. First, a point-wise residual gating module injects occlusal-view SAM embeddings into 3D point features to refine tooth-gingiva and inter-tooth boundaries. Second, a center-guided mask refinement regularizes consistency between instance masks and geometric centroids, reducing center drift. Furthermore, an order-aware Hungarian matching strategy integrates anatomical tooth order and center distance into similarity-based assignment, ensuring coherent labeling even under missing or crowded dentitions. On 3DTeethSeg'22, SOFTooth achieves state-of-the-art overall accuracy and mean IoU, with clear gains on cases involving third molars, demonstrating that rich 2D semantics can be effectively transferred to 3D tooth instance segmentation without 2D fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u76842D SAM\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u5165\u52303D\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a9\u7801\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0e\u987a\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863D\u7259\u9f7f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7b2c\u4e09\u78e8\u7259\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5f25\u54082D\u5f3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e3D\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\uff1a\u5229\u75282D\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u8865\u8db33D\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u5bf92D\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u989d\u5916\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u70b9\u7ea7\u6b8b\u5dee\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u6765\u81ea\u566c\u5408\u9762\u89c6\u89d2\u7684SAM\u5d4c\u5165\u6309\u9700\u878d\u5408\u51653D\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u8fb9\u754c\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2) \u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u7cbe\u4fee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u7801\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8d28\u5fc3\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b3) \u987a\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5c06\u7259\u4f4d\u5e8f\u5217\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ed3\u5408\u5230\u5206\u914d\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e2d\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u62e5\u6324\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "SOFTooth\u57283D\u7259\u9f7f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u54082D\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e3D\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7b2c\u4e09\u78e8\u7259\u7b49\u7a00\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u5347\u660e\u663e\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u70b9\u7ea7\u6b8b\u5dee\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u5757\u6ce8\u5165SAM\u76842D\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u7cbe\u4fee\u4ee5\u53ca\u987a\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5308\u7259\u5229\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u57283DTeethSeg'22\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cmIoU\u3002", "conclusion": "SOFTooth\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u51bb\u7ed3\u76842D\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u97002D\u63a9\u7801\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53473D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u754c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6f02\u79fb\u4e0e\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6709\u7f3a\u635f\u6216\u62e5\u6324\u7259\u5f13\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6807\u7b7e\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002"}}

However, its inherently complex nature, spanning visual perception, cognition, and emotion, poses fundamental challenges. Although aesthetic descriptions offer a viable representation of this complexity, two critical challenges persist: (1) data scarcity and imbalance: existing dataset overly focuses on visual perception and neglects deeper dimensions due to the expensive manual annotation; and (2) model fragmentation: current visual networks isolate aesthetic attributes with multi-branch encoder, while multimodal methods represented by contrastive learning struggle to effectively process long-form textual descriptions. To resolve challenge (1), we first present the Refined Aesthetic Description (RAD) dataset, a large-scale (70k), multi-dimensional structured dataset, generated via an iterative pipeline without heavy annotation costs and easy to scale. To address challenge (2), we propose ArtQuant, an aesthetics assessment framework for artistic images which not only couples isolated aesthetic dimensions through joint description generation, but also better models long-text semantics with the help of LLM decoders. Besides, theoretical analysis confirms this symbiosis: RAD's semantic adequacy (data) and generation paradigm (model) collectively minimize prediction entropy, providing mathematical grounding for the framework. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several datasets while requiring only 33% of conventional training epochs, narrowing the cognitive gap between artistic images and aesthetic judgment.

However, current approaches relegate world models to limited roles: they operate within ostensibly unified architectures that still keep world prediction and motion planning as decoupled processes. To bridge this gap, we propose DriveLaW, a novel paradigm that unifies video generation and motion planning. By directly injecting the latent representation from its video generator into the planner, DriveLaW ensures inherent consistency between high-fidelity future generation and reliable trajectory planning. Specifically, DriveLaW consists of two core components: DriveLaW-Video, our powerful world model that generates high-fidelity forecasting with expressive latent representations, and DriveLaW-Act, a diffusion planner that generates consistent and reliable trajectories from the latent of DriveLaW-Video, with both components optimized by a three-stage progressive training strategy. The power of our unified paradigm is demonstrated by new state-of-the-art results across both tasks. DriveLaW not only advances video prediction significantly, surpassing best-performing work by 33.3% in FID and 1.8% in FVD, but also achieves a new record on the NAVSIM planning benchmark.", "AI": {"tldr": "DriveLaW\u901a\u8fc7\u628a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u9690\u8868\u793a\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u4e16\u754c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u89c6\u4e3a\u5206\u79bb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002DriveLaW\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u9690\u8868\u793a\u5f25\u5408\u4e8c\u8005\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "DriveLaW\u7531\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\u7ec4\u6210\uff1aDriveLaW-Video\uff08\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u672a\u6765\u5e27\u5e76\u8f93\u51fa\u5bcc\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u9690\u8868\u793a\uff09\u548cDriveLaW-Act\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u4eceDriveLaW-Video\u7684\u9690\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cDriveLaW\u5728FID\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6b64\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd533.3%\uff0c\u5728FVD\u4e0a\u63d0\u53471.8%\uff1b\u5728NAVSIM\u89c4\u5212\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u597d\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7edf\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c4\u5212\u4e24\u4efb\u52a1\u5747\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "DriveLaW\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7684\u9690\u53d8\u91cf\u76f4\u63a5\u6ce8\u5165\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing preference-based training methods like Diffusion Direct Preference Optimization help address these issues but rely on costly and potentially noisy human-labeled datasets. In this work, we introduce Direct Diffusion Score Preference Optimization (DDSPO), which directly derives per-timestep supervision from winning and losing policies when such policies are available. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on final samples, DDSPO provides dense, transition-level signals across the denoising trajectory. In practice, we avoid reliance on labeled data by automatically generating preference signals using a pretrained reference model: we contrast its outputs when conditioned on original prompts versus semantically degraded variants. This practical strategy enables effective score-space preference supervision without explicit reward modeling or manual annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that DDSPO improves text-image alignment and visual quality, outperforming or matching existing preference-based methods while requiring significantly less supervision.

Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches.

We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoFi-Dec is a training-free, model-agnostic decoding framework reducing LVLM hallucinations by synthesizing multi-level visual conditions and fusing them via Wasserstein alignment.", "motivation": "LVLMs hallucinate when generated outputs are not grounded in visual input; need a training-free method to improve grounding during decoding.", "method": "Decoding-time hallucination mitigation with coarse-to-fine multi-visual grounding", "result": "CoFi-Dec generates coarse and fine textual responses, converts them to images, creates multi-level visual hypotheses, and fuses their predictive distributions using a Wasserstein-based mechanism to produce more faithful outputs.", "conclusion": "CoFi-Dec effectively reduces entity- and semantic-level hallucinations across benchmarks without extra training and can be applied to various LVLMs."}}

The methodology involves sequential stages of image preprocessing, annotation, waterline detection, scale gap estimation, and numeric reading extraction. Experiments demonstrate that waterline detection achieved high precision of 94.24 percent and an F1 score of 83.64 percent, while scale gap detection provided accurate geometric calibration for subsequent reading extraction. Incorporating scale gap metadata substantially improved the predictive performance of LLMs, with Gemini Stage 2 achieving the highest accuracy, with a mean absolute error of 5.43 cm, root mean square error of 8.58 cm, and R squared of 0.84 under optimal image conditions. Results highlight the sensitivity of LLMs to image quality, with degraded images producing higher errors, and underscore the importance of combining geometric metadata with multimodal artificial intelligence for robust water level estimation.

Deterministic I2I translation, such as in image super-resolution, extends this concept by guaranteeing that each input generates a consistent and predictable output, closely matching the ground truth (GT) with high fidelity. In this paper, we propose a denoising Brownian bridge model with dual approximators (Dual-approx Bridge), a novel generative model that exploits the Brownian bridge dynamics and two neural network-based approximators (one for forward and one for reverse process) to produce faithful output with negligible variance and high image quality in I2I translations. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets including image generation and super-resolution demonstrate the consistent and superior performance of Dual-approx Bridge in terms of image quality and faithfulness to GT when compared to both stochastic and deterministic baselines.

Nonetheless, when confronted with lengthy videos, these models struggle: their temporal windows are narrow, and they fail to notice fine-grained semantic shifts that unfold over extended durations. Moreover, mainstream text-based retrieval pipelines, which rely chiefly on surface-level lexical overlap, ignore the rich temporal interdependence among visual, audio, and subtitle channels. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TV-RAG, a training-free architecture that couples temporal alignment with entropy-guided semantics to improve long-video reasoning. The framework contributes two main mechanisms: \\emph{(i)} a time-decay retrieval module that injects explicit temporal offsets into the similarity computation, thereby ranking text queries according to their true multimedia context; and \\emph{(ii)} an entropy-weighted key-frame sampler that selects evenly spaced, information-dense frames, reducing redundancy while preserving representativeness. By weaving these temporal and semantic signals together, TV-RAG realises a dual-level reasoning routine that can be grafted onto any LVLM without re-training or fine-tuning. The resulting system offers a lightweight, budget-friendly upgrade path and consistently surpasses most leading baselines across established long-video benchmarks such as Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench, confirming the effectiveness of our model.

To overcome these difficulties, we propose Iterative Diffusion Inference-Time Scaling with Adaptive Frequency Steering (IAFS), a training-free framework that jointly leverages iterative refinement and frequency-aware particle fusion.

In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control.

Traditional safety methods like text blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant drawbacks: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation that retains the model's original weights. PurifyGen introduces a dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification without explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforcing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence. We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe content.

Here, we introduce RxnBench, a multi-tiered benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate MLLMs on chemical reaction understanding from scientific PDFs. RxnBench comprises two tasks: Single-Figure QA (SF-QA), which tests fine-grained visual perception and mechanistic reasoning using 1,525 questions derived from 305 curated reaction schemes, and Full-Document QA (FD-QA), which challenges models to synthesize information from 108 articles, requiring cross-modal integration of text, schemes, and tables. Our evaluation of MLLMs reveals a critical capability gap: while models excel at extracting explicit text, they struggle with deep chemical logic and precise structural recognition. Notably, models with inference-time reasoning significantly outperform standard architectures, yet none achieve 50\\% accuracy on FD-QA.

However, its extension to generation tasks remains nascent and limited by scenario-specific mechanisms that hinder generalization and adaptation. In this work, we present ThinkGen, the first think-driven visual generation framework that explicitly leverages MLLM's CoT reasoning in various generation scenarios. ThinkGen employs a decoupled architecture comprising a pretrained MLLM and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), wherein the MLLM generates tailored instructions based on user intent, and DiT produces high-quality images guided by these instructions. We further propose a separable GRPO-based training paradigm (SepGRPO), alternating reinforcement learning between the MLLM and DiT modules. This flexible design enables joint training across diverse datasets, facilitating effective CoT reasoning for a wide range of generative scenarios.

In this paper, we establish a theoretical connection between principal component analysis (PCA) and the Haar transform under circulant representation, and present a computationally simple denoising algorithm. The proposed method, termed Haar-tSVD, exploits a unified tensor singular value decomposition (t-SVD) projection combined with Haar transform to efficiently capture global and local patch correlations. Haar-tSVD operates as a one-step, parallelizable plug-and-play denoiser that eliminates the need for learning local bases, thereby striking a balance between denoising speed and performance. Besides, an adaptive noise estimation scheme is introduced to improve robustness according to eigenvalue analysis of the circulant structure. To further enhance the performance under severe noise conditions, we integrate deep neural networks with Haar-tSVD based on the established Haar-PCA relationship.

To address these challenges, we propose ProGuard, a vision-language proactive guard that identifies and describes out-of-distribution (OOD) safety risks without the need for model adjustments required by traditional reactive approaches. We first construct a modality-balanced dataset of 87K samples, each annotated with both binary safety labels and risk categories under a hierarchical multimodal safety taxonomy, effectively mitigating modality bias and ensuring consistent moderation across text, image, and text-image inputs. Based on this dataset, we train our vision-language base model purely through reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve efficient and concise reasoning. To approximate proactive safety scenarios in a controlled setting, we further introduce an OOD safety category inference task and augment the RL objective with a synonym-bank-based similarity reward that encourages the model to generate concise descriptions for unseen unsafe categories. Experimental results show that ProGuard achieves performance comparable to closed-source large models on binary safety classification, substantially outperforms existing open-source guard models on unsafe content categorization. Most notably, ProGuard delivers a strong proactive moderation ability, improving OOD risk detection by 52.6% and OOD risk description by 64.8%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProGuard\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\uff08OOD\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u7b80\u660e\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u62a4\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4e0d\u65ad\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001OOD\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u52a8\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u4e3b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b0\u5174\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u768487K\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1OOD\u5b89\u5168\u7c7b\u522b\u63a8\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u5e93\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u522b\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u6d01\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "ProGuard\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4e3b\u52a8\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6a21\u6001\u5916\uff08OOD\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b87K\u6837\u672c\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u6709\u4e8c\u5143\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8de8\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8bbe\u8ba1OOD\u5b89\u5168\u7c7b\u522b\u63a8\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u5e93\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u4ee5\u9f13\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u7c7b\u522b\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u660e\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u4e8c\u5143\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u9632\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0fOOD\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u534752.6%\u548c64.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "ProGuard\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5b88\u62a4\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408OOD\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u540c\u4e49\u8bcd\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b89\u5168\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the simultaneous denoising of all video frames with bidirectional attention via an iterative process in diffusion models prevents real-time interaction. While existing distillation methods can make the model autoregressive and reduce sampling steps to mitigate this, they focus primarily on text-to-video generation, leaving the human-AI interaction unnatural and less efficient. This paper targets real-time interactive video diffusion conditioned on a multimodal context, including text, image, and audio, to bridge the gap. Given the observation that the leading on-policy distillation approach Self Forcing encounters challenges (visual artifacts like flickering, black frames, and quality degradation) with multimodal conditioning, we investigate an improved distillation recipe with emphasis on the quality of condition inputs as well as the initialization and schedule for the on-policy optimization. On benchmarks for multimodal-conditioned (audio, image, and text) avatar video generation including HDTF, AVSpeech, and CelebV-HQ, our distilled model matches the visual quality of the full-step, bidirectional baselines of similar or larger size with 20x less inference cost and latency. Further, we integrate our model with audio language models and long-form video inference technique Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks to build LiveTalk, a real-time multimodal interactive avatar system. System-level evaluation on our curated multi-turn interaction benchmark shows LiveTalk outperforms state-of-the-art models (Sora2, Veo3) in multi-turn video coherence and content quality, while reducing response latency from 1 to 2 minutes to real-time generation, enabling seamless human-AI multimodal interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u6587\u672c\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u97f3\u9891\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u84b8\u998f\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f7f\u6269\u6563\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u5f0f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea620\u500d\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u8f6e\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684LiveTalk\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u53cc\u5411\u5e76\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e0d\u5229\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\uff1b\u5df2\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u97f3\u9891\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e14Self Forcing\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4Self Forcing\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5728\u7ebf\u84b8\u998f\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u9884\u5904\u7406/\u589e\u5f3a\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408Anchor-Heavy Identity Sinks\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u97f3\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u6784\u5efa\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "Distilled autoregressive multimodal video diffusion model enabling real-time interactive avatar generation", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u6240\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2aavatar\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5168\u6b65\u53cc\u5411\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ece\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u964d\u81f3\u5b9e\u65f6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition (\"Is it a cat or a dog?\") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models.

Previous studies have reported strong performance with popular detection models. For example, YOLOv7 achieved an mAP50-95 of 0.51 using an input image size of 640 x 1280, RT-DETR reached an mAP50-95 of 0.65 with an image size of 640 x 640, and YOLOv9 obtained an mAP50-95 of 0.598 at the same resolution. Despite these results, limitations in dataset construction continue to cause issues, particularly the frequent misclassification of bright artificial lights as fire.\n  This report presents three main contributions: an additional NIR dataset, a two-stage detection model, and Patched-YOLO. First, to address data scarcity, we explore and apply various data augmentation strategies for both the NIR dataset and the classification dataset. Second, to improve night-time fire detection accuracy while reducing false positives caused by artificial lights, we propose a two-stage pipeline combining YOLOv11 and EfficientNetV2-B0.

These complexities require to be addressed with an effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high representational efficiency of EfficientNet-B3. A dual optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant improvement in performance, with the suggested model reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\uff08SRFA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8e\u80f0\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u6d41\u7a0b\u5305\u62ec\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u57fa\u4e8eMAGRes-UNet\u7684\u5206\u5272\u3001\u5e26\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u5b58\u50a8\u7684DenseNet-121\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u6df7\u5408HHO-BA\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3001Vision Transformer\u4e0eEfficientNet-B3\u878d\u5408\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caSSA\u4e0eGWO\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u8d85\u53c2\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5728\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u62a5\u544a\u51c6\u786e\u738796.23%\u3001F1 95.58%\u3001\u7279\u5f02\u602794.83%\u3002", "motivation": "\u80f0\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u5728CT\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u5f62\u6001\u4e0e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53d8\u5316\u5927\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u5fae\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u663e\u8457\u6027\u5e76\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u6a21\u6001/\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u56fe\u50cf\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001MAGRes-UNet\u5206\u5272\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aROI\u3001\u7528\u5e26\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\u5b58\u50a8\u7684DenseNet-121\u62bd\u53d6\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u6df1\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u6df7\u5408HHO-BA\u7684\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06ViT\u4e0eEfficientNet-B3\u878d\u5408\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff1b\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528SSA\u4e0eGWO\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4f5c\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSRFA\u8fbe96.23%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u300195.58% F1-score\u300194.83%\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfCNN\u4e0e\u90e8\u5206Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u7ec6\u8282\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u8bf4\u660e\u3002", "conclusion": "SRFA\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80f0\u817a\u80bf\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f85\u52a9\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u9700\u5728\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u5916\u90e8\u591a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines.

To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OmniAgent\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u97f3\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u611f\u77e5\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u542c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u9759\u6001\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cOmniAgent\u5728\u4e09\u9879\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u63d0\u534710%-20%\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u3001\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5e27-\u5b57\u5e55\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4e3b\u52a8\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u96c6\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u9f50\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u65f6\u523b\u8c03\u7528\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u97f3\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u611f\u77e5\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u97f3\u9891\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65f6\u95f4\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u518d\u89e6\u53d1\u89c6\u89c9\u6216\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0cOmniAgent\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ea610%-20%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u9891\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86SOTA\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \\textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faIDT\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u524d\u9988\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5185\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u4e3a\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u53cd\u7167\u7387\u3001\u6f2b\u53cd\u5c04\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u955c\u9762\u9634\u5f71\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "single-view diffusion methods yield view inconsistency when extended to multi-view; need joint reasoning for consistency and efficiency without iterative sampling", "method": "feed-forward transformer-based multi-view intrinsic decomposition", "result": "produces view-consistent diffuse reflectance, coherent diffuse shading, and isolated specular components; better multi-view consistency than prior methods on synthetic and real datasets", "conclusion": "IDT\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53ca\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5185\u5728\u5206\u89e3\u6027\u80fd"}}

Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: \"Diffusion knows transparency.\" Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u7528\u5408\u6210\u900f\u660e\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6+\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cfLoRA\u5728DiT\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3RGB\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u6f5c\u7801\uff0c\u5f97\u5230D K T\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u900f\u660e/\u53cd\u5c04\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6df1\u5ea6/\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u96f6\u6837\u672cSOTA\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6293\u53d6\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u611f\u77e5\u624b\u6bb5\u5728\u900f\u660e/\u53cd\u5c04\u7269\u4f53\u4e0a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5408\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u900f\u660e\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u63a8\u6d4b\u5176\u5185\u542b\u5149\u5b66\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u53ef\u7528\u4f5c\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u89c6\u9891\u611f\u77e5\u5148\u9a8c\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa11k\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6TransPhy3D\uff08Blender/Cycles\u6e32\u67d3RGB/depth/normals\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u52a0\u5165LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6/\u6cd5\u7ebf\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u628aRGB\u4e0e\u566a\u6df1\u5ea6\u6f5c\u7801\u62fc\u63a5\u8fdbDiT\u9aa8\u5e72\u5e76\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5e27\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "result": "Paper builds TransPhy3D synthetic dataset and trains a video-to-video translator (DKT) using video diffusion model and LoRA to predict depth and normals for transparent objects, achieving zero-shot SOTA and improving grasping success.", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u786e\u5b9e\u5185\u5316\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u65b9\u5f0f\u6539\u9020\u4e3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6/\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.
