### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过融合多尺度特征、基于不确定性的查询选择和合成/真实样本加权训练，结合数据增强提升小目标与低对比船舶的检测性能，并在严格真实数据上评估与模块消融分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标通常体积小、对比低且真实标注数据稀缺，直接训练检测器效果受限；使用高质量合成数据能缓解数据不足但存在域差，需要设计模型结构与训练策略同时提升精度与实时性。

Method: 在RT-DETR基础上：1) 引入多尺度特征融合模块以增强小目标特征表达；2) 采用基于不确定性的查询选择机制筛选高可靠性检测提议；3) 对合成与真实样本设定智能权重平衡训练以缩小域差；4) 使用类别均衡的数据增强策略；最后在真实测试集上严格评估并做模块级消融与失败案例分析。

Result: 实验表明，该系统在严格真实数据评估下实现实时检测并提升小目标召回与精度；消融分析显示多尺度融合、查询选择与样本加权均显著提升性能，系统在极端光照与恶劣海况下仍能维持较好检测效果。

Conclusion: 基于RT-DETR并结合多尺度融合、不确定性最小化的查询选择及合成与真实样本的权重策略，可在保证端到端检测优势的同时提升海上小目标检测的鲁棒性与实时性；各模块通过消融实验均对性能有正向贡献，在极端光照与海况下仍保持稳定表现。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [Detecting Legend Items on Historical Maps Using GPT-4o with In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08385)
*Sofia Kirsanova,Yao-Yi Chiang,Weiwei Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 结合LayoutLMv3做布局检测与GPT-4o的in-context learning，通过结构化JSON提示实现高效、可扩展的历史地图图例解析，实验达88% F1、85% IoU。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提取历史地图图例以便解释制图符号，解决图例布局不一致和非结构化格式带来的自动提取挑战。

Method: 先用LayoutLMv3检测文档布局与候选区域，再用GPT-4o通过少量示例和结构化JSON提示预测并链接图例符号与描述的边界框，输出结构化配对信息。

Result: 提出将LayoutLMv3用于布局检测并结合GPT-4o通过少量示例学习（in-context learning）进行基于边界框预测的图例项与描述匹配；使用结构化JSON提示的GPT-4性能优于基线，达到88% F1和85% IoU。

Conclusion: 该方法在各种视觉样式的历史地图上实现了可扩展、布局感知的图例解析，提升了地图索引与检索能力；性能受提示设计、示例数量和布局对齐影响。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%
IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect
performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and
improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various
visual styles.

### [3] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynamicEval构建了含动态相机运动的评测集并设计了纠正遮挡/显示错误的背景一致性指标与基于实例内部点追踪的前景一致性指标，在视频级和模型级上均更符合人类偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V基准忽视动态相机运动与视频级选择需求，导致无法有效评估生成视频在动态摄像场景下的质量与可比性。

Method: 基于VBench运动平滑度取得可解释的误差图，利用目标误差图校正由遮挡/去遮挡引起的错误；前景一致性通过在实例内追踪关键点及其邻域来评估物体保真度。

Result: DynamicEval提出了一个针对动态相机运动的T2V评测基准，包括45k人工注释，关注背景场景一致性和前景物体一致性，并提出了改进的背景一致性和前景一致性衡量方法，提升了与人类判断的相关性。

Conclusion: 提出的两项新指标在处理相机动态、遮挡/去遮挡问题及物体细节保持方面优于现有度量，整体上提高了与人工判断的相关性，建立了更全面的T2V动态运动评估基准。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [4] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISP通过在RED上引入重启惯性并兼容score-based先验，实现了在不要求先验凸性的情况下更快的驻点收敛率；理论与连续时间分析支持其与heavy-ball ODE的联系，实验证明在多种逆问题中能快速收敛并获得高质量重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多注重设计复杂先验以提升重建质量，但收敛加速通常依赖启发式技巧；目标是设计既有理论收敛保证又能快速收敛并兼容高质量先验的方法。

Method: 在RED框架上引入带重启的惯性项（重启动量），并允许使用基于score的图像先验；分析离散算法收敛性并导出相应连续时间动力学，与heavy-ball ODE建立联系。

Result: 证明RISP比RED有更快的驻点收敛率（无需先验凸性）；理论上分析了连续时间极限并通过实验证明在多种成像逆问题上既加速收敛又保持高质量重建。

Conclusion: 提出RISP在加速收敛和保持高质量重建之间取得平衡；在不要求先验凸性的条件下，证明了比RED更快的驻点收敛率。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [5] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向真实超低剂量CT (uLDCT) 去噪的数据净化(Image Purification, IP)策略，构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集，并基于此提出频域流匹配(Frequency-domain Flow Matching, FFM)模型。IP通过生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对为训练提供高质量数据基础；FFM在频域与IP协同保持解噪后图像的解剖结构完整性。实验证明IP可显著提升多种主流去噪模型性能，FFM+IP在结构保持上达到了SOTA。代码与数据集开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实uLDCT存在严重噪声、伪影以及与NDCT之间的空间错位，导致直接使用基于合成噪声或对齐数据训练的去噪网络效果受限。本工作旨在通过数据净化和频域流匹配模型解决数据不匹配及结构保持问题。

Method: 1) 构建真实临床uLDCT肺部数据集；2) 提出Image Purification (IP)策略，生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对（可能包括配准、伪NDCT生成或结构重建）；3) 设计Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM)模型，在频域进行流匹配以学习噪声分布并保持结构；4) 在真实数据上与主流去噪方法比较并进行消融实验。

Result: 在作者构建的真实uLDCT临床数据集上，IP策略提升了多种主流去噪模型的性能；FFM+IP在解剖结构保持指标上达到或超过SOTA，且整体视觉与定量评估均有明显改善。

Conclusion: IP策略有效缓解真实uLDCT与NDCT之间的空间错位问题，为网络训练提供结构对齐的数据，从而显著提升去噪模型在临床uLDCT上的性能；FFM模型在频域建模可进一步保证解剖结构的保持，组合方法在真实数据上达到SOTA水平。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available
at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

### [6] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes D2RA, a training-free projection-based single-image attack that removes/weakens semantic watermarks by mapping images to natural priors in complementary representations, effectively reducing detectability across schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by the increasing use of generative models, creating demand for watermarking methods to ensure content attribution/provenance, and concerns that current semantic watermarking schemes may be vulnerable.

Method: D2RA projects watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations (e.g., latent/frequency) to suppress embedded signals while preserving visual fidelity; it's training-free and works per-image without access to watermarking model.

Result: They present D2RA, a training-free single-image attack that projects watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations to suppress watermarks while preserving visual fidelity, and show experiments that it reduces detectability across diverse schemes. Code available.

Conclusion: Current semantic watermarking designs have fundamental weaknesses; D2RA can consistently reduce watermark detectability without model access, suggesting need for more robust watermarking.

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [7] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过低秩适配器、合成动态图像训练以及CS-CFG，引入了一种可以用静态配对图像数据训练的视频风格迁移框架，提升了时序连贯性和风格迁移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏带配对标签的视频数据，难以监督训练视频风格迁移模型，因此希望利用大量成对静态图像数据并改造模型以适配时序特性。

Method: 在视频扩散骨干中插入低秩风格适配器，并用共享的图像增强合成模拟运动生成训练视频片段，同时提出CS-CFG将分类器无条件引导分解为独立文本（风格）和视频（内容）方向。

Result: 在多个基准上，PickStyle在时序一致性、风格保真度和内容保持方面均优于现有基线，达到了更好的定性和定量表现。

Conclusion: PickStyle有效利用成对静态图像数据和低秩适配器，实现了在视频风格迁移中兼顾内容保留与风格一致性。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [8] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TRAVL（平衡数据+轨迹感知注意力）提升VLM判别物理不可能动作，及ImplausiBench基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型虽视觉真实但常违反物理规律，需自动化量化评估物理合理性的VLM判别方法。

Method: 通过构建平衡数据集、引入trajectory-aware attention模块改进运动编码，并采用严格评估（人工与LLM评审）进行微调。

Result: Paper proposes TRAVL fine-tuning and ImplausiBench benchmark to detect physical plausibility in video; improves VLMs' temporal/causal reasoning.

Conclusion: TRAVL显著提升VLM在物理合理性判断上的表现，ImplausiBench提供无语言偏差的严格评估。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [9] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S3FN augments hyperspectral image classification with LLM-derived textual class descriptions embedded by BERT/RoBERTa, improving classification accuracy and reducing overfitting on three benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address overfitting and limited labeled data in HSI classification by augmenting spectral-spatial models with class-specific textual semantics from LLMs.

Method: Generate class descriptions with LLMs; encode them using pre-trained text encoders (BERT/RoBERTa) into label embeddings; fuse with spectral-spatial features in a classification network; evaluate on three HSI datasets showing improved performance.

Result: Proposed S3FN integrates LLM-generated textual descriptions embedded via pre-trained text encoders to improve feature-label alignment, showing significant performance gains on three HSI datasets (Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, DeepHS-Fruit).

Conclusion: Textual semantics from LLMs complement spectral-spatial features, improving HSI classification; semantically augmented models like S3FN offer a promising direction.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [10] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 针对VLM的VQA隐私泄露问题，提出CAGUL：利用交叉模态注意力识别并变换低重要视觉token，通过外部模块实现高效撤回，无需微调预训练模型且效果良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模预训练VLM可能在训练中记忆并回放敏感或私人信息，传统的基于微调或重训练的撤回方法开销大且不灵活；VLM的图像输入增加了撤回难度，需同时处理视觉和文本的敏感信息。

Method: 利用交叉模态注意力（cross-modal attention）评估视觉token对生成输出的重要性，识别低重要性token并由外部编码器对其进行变换以嵌入撤回信息，从而无需微调或重训练预训练模型。

Result: 在VQA任务上，CAGUL在不改变预训练模型参数的情况下，防止敏感信息泄露的效果优于或与基于微调的基线方法持平，同时保持模型的参考行为并避免昂贵的重训练成本。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种用于视觉-语言模型(VLMs)的轻量级撤回（unlearning）方法CAGUL，通过引入外部模块对视觉token进行有针对性的变换，防止模型在VQA任务中泄露敏感信息，同时保持参考模型的行为特征。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [11] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaSC是针对无人机RGB影像的轻量级玉米苗株计数系统，使用YOLOv9检测并按行分割计数，在真实田块验证中表现出高精度（尤其在原始帧对齐模式）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工计数费时费力且易错，尤其在大面积或异质田块中；需要一种低成本、可扩展且准确的自动化方法用于农业管理与科研。

Method: 提出两种输入模式（切片马赛克模式与基于单帧的单应性对齐模式），使用轻量级YOLOv9检测V2-V10生长阶段的苗株，基于检测点的空间分布进行行与区段分割，再统计行内株数。实现可在经济型硬件上近实时处理（83帧/60.63s）。

Result: 在2024夏季试验田的实地人工计数对比中，马赛克模式与人工计数的R^2=0.616，单帧对齐模式R^2=0.906，展示了良好的精度与处理速度。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了MaizeStandCounting (MaSC)，一种面向低成本无人机RGB影像的轻量级玉米苗株数自动计数算法，能够区分玉米与杂草并按行实现精确计数。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [12] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Quick-CapsNet通过减少胶囊数量实现5倍推理加速，代价是小幅准确率下降，可通过更强的解码器部分弥补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CapsNet训练和推理慢的问题，使其适用于实时或对延迟敏感的应用场景。

Method: 通过减少生成的胶囊数量来简化CapsNet结构，进而提升计算效率，并可选替换为更强的解码器以恢复或提升精度。

Result: 在MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN和CIFAR-10上推理速度提升约5倍，同时只有边际的准确率下降；使用更强解码器后精度有所改进。

Conclusion: Quick-CapsNet在速度与准确率之间做出权衡，显著提高推理速度但引入少量准确率损失。

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [13] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Rectified-CFG++：在每步先做条件RF锚定，再做加权条件校正，保证轨迹靠近数据流形并稳定，显著优于标准CFG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address severe off-manifold drift and instability when applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) to rectified flow (RF) based diffusion models, which causes visual artifacts and text misalignment.

Method: 设计自适应预测-校正器：先执行条件化的RF更新以锚定样本，再应用在条件与无条件速度场之间插值的加权校正；证明速度场边际一致并在有界管状邻域内保持轨迹；在大规模模型和数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance combining conditional RF updates and a weighted conditional correction interpolating between conditional and unconditional velocity fields, producing marginally consistent velocity fields whose trajectories stay in a bounded tubular neighborhood of the data manifold; improves text-to-image performance on Flux, Stable Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina across datasets.

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++稳定了CFG在RF模型上的应用，避免离流形漂移，提升图像质量与文本对齐，在多种大模型和基准上均有显著改进。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PIT-QMM，一种融合文本、图像与点云的多模态端到端模型，用于无参考点云质量评估，性能和可解释性均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LMM在图像/视频质量评估上取得进展，但对3D点云资产的无参考质量评估探索不足。不同模态（文本、2D投影、3D视图）对点云质量含互补信息，利用LMM可提高NR-PCQA性能并增加可解释性。

Method: 构建基于大多模态模型的端到端框架PIT-QMM，输入包括文本描述、2D投影图像和原始点云，通过多模态融合模块提取并融合特征，随后回归预测质量分数；训练时使用常用点云质量数据集并优化收敛速度，此外设计机制用于像素/点级失真定位与失真类型识别。

Result: 在多个流行基准上，PIT-QMM以更少的训练迭代显著超越现有最先进方法，同时实现了失真定位和类型识别能力，展示了更好的性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: PIT-QMM通过融合文本、2D投影和3D点云视图的多模态特征，实现了无需参考的点云感知质量评估，在常用基准上优于现有方法，并可进行失真定位与识别，增强了可解释性与交互性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

*Harshala Gammulle,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan,Simon Denman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于双流对齐和量子-经典融合的动作分割网络，通过跨注意力与动作引导调制实现帧级与动作级特征共享，对齐损失促使两流一致，在多数据集上达SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作分割多为单流建模，难以兼顾动作本身与动作过渡特征；引入第二条动作流以提供动作语义与过渡线索，有助提高分割精度；探索量子-经典混合模型以增强特征表达能力。

Method: 提出双流架构：一条帧级流负责时空帧序列建模，另一条动作级流学习动作特征；两流通过TC模块（跨注意力+Q-ActGM调制）进行信息交流与融合；引入双流对齐损失，包括关系一致损失、跨层对比损失和循环一致性重构损失；在GTEA、Breakfast、50Salads、EgoProceL数据集上进行评估与消融。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（GTEA、Breakfast、50Salads、EgoProceL）上取得了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法；消融实验验证了TC模块、Q-ActGM和对齐损失等组件的有效性。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了一种双流对齐网络（DSA Net），通过引入动作特征流来辅助帧级分割，以捕捉动作及动作过渡信息并提高分割性能；使用时序上下文模块（TC block）与基于量子-经典混合的Q-ActGM进行跨流融合；通过双流对齐损失（包含关系一致、跨层对比、循环一致性重构三部分）鼓励两流共享特征空间。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

*Yanjie Pan,Qingdong He,Lidong Wang,Bo Peng,Mingmin Chi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出OIE（Once is Enough），一种先替换首帧服装再逐帧合成的视频虚拟试穿方法。通过在首帧使用图像级服装替换并以其作为内容控制，结合姿态与掩码引导视频扩散模型的时间先验，减少对Diffusion Transformer架构的改动，显著降低可训练参数并提升计算效率，同时保持竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于Diffusion Transformer的视频虚拟试穿中，直接引入服装参考分支会导致需修改骨干网络并增加大量可训练参数，且服装特征在潜空间中缺乏时间属性，需要额外学习；因此寻求更参数高效且保持时间一致性的替代方案。

Method: 先用图像级服装迁移模型将参考服装替换到视频的第一帧，得到编辑后的首帧；然后固定或以首帧内容作为条件，结合视频中每帧的姿态信息与人体掩码，顺序生成后续帧，借此构建时间一致性而无需在Transformer中直接引入服装分支或额外时间学习模块。

Result: 实验表明OIE在参数量和计算量上优于需改动骨干的双分支方法，同时在视觉质量和时间一致性上仍保持领先或接近领先的表现。

Conclusion: OIE在参数和计算效率受限的场景下，能用首帧替换结合姿态/掩码引导的逐帧生成策略，避免在Diffusion Transformer上引入大量可训练参数，仍能达到或接近现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用IP-Adapter生成的主体掩码在第二次推理中对图像令牌进行掩码，限制背景占用主体令牌，从而提高文本提示（尤其关于地点/场景）的遵从性，获得较好的提示与源图像对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化扩散模型常在生成包含给定主体的图像时倾向于复刻源图像，导致忽视文本提示，尤其在要求改变场景或位置时表现不足。利用自动掩码将主体和背景分离，可使提示更好地控制场景变化。

Method: 先用IP-Adapter自动分割生成主体掩码；第二次推理过程中对图像令牌应用该掩码，限制背景区域不被主体令牌占用，让文本提示的注意力更多作用于背景信息，从而避免生成时简单复制原始主体。比较了若干测试时个性化方法，评估提示与源图像的一致性。

Result: 在与其他测试时个性化方法比较中，所提方法在提示匹配度和源图像一致性方面表现较高，能在保持主体相似性的同时更准确地满足描述场景和位置的文本提示。

Conclusion: 该论文提出使用IP-Adapter自动生成的掩码，在推理时对图像令牌进行第二次掩码限制，从而将注意力集中在主体而非背景，提升文本提示与主体的一致性，尤其在描述位置和场景的提示下效果显著。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不完整版式下自动放置文本框以兼顾视觉吸引力和信息传达效率，探索不同建模范式（专用架构 vs. 通用VLM）对任务性能的影响。

Method: 比较了标准的基于Transformer的方法、小型VLM（Phi3.5-vision）、大型预训练VLM（Gemini）以及能处理多图像的扩展Transformer；在Crello数据集上基于位置、大小和语义一致性进行评估。

Result: Transformer基线通常表现更好，尤其是当模型获取更丰富的外观特征时；但所有方法在处理非常小的文本或高密度布局时仍存在显著困难。

Conclusion: 该研究表明在广告和网页版式文本框自动放置任务中，任务专用的Transformer模型在大多数情况下优于通用视觉语言模型，尤其是在引入更丰富的外观信息时。

Abstract: In layout design for advertisements and web pages, balancing visual appeal
and communication efficiency is crucial. This study examines automated text box
placement in incomplete layouts, comparing a standard Transformer-based method,
a small Vision and Language Model (Phi3.5-vision), a large pretrained VLM

Evaluations on the Crello dataset show the standard Transformer-based models
generally outperform VLM-based approaches, particularly when incorporating
richer appearance information. However, all methods face challenges with very
small text or densely populated layouts. These findings highlight the benefits
of task-specific architectures and suggest avenues for further improvement in
automated layout design.

TL;DR: Introduce FERM to suppress misalignments in pyramid decoders and TCI to adaptively control iterations, forming TCIP that achieves superior accuracy and generalizability with compact model and comparable speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate accumulation of anatomical misalignments in pyramid decoders and adaptively determine iteration numbers across varying deformation requirements.

Method: Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) and Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy for deformable medical image registration

Result: Proposed TCIP (FERM+TCI) outperforms SOTA on three brain MRI and one abdomen CT datasets in accuracy, with similar speed and compact size; FERM and TCI generalize to other networks; ablation validates effectiveness.

Conclusion: FERM and TCI effectively reduce anatomical misalignment accumulation and adaptively control registration iterations, improving accuracy and generalizability while remaining efficient.

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

TL;DR: 提出将多种控制信号混合输入的视频生成框架，使用变分推断与逐步KL最小化及上下文分解以提升可控性与多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实视频制作需同时支持不同粒度的用户控制（从精确轨迹到粗文本提示），现有模型通常只适配固定输入格式，难以同时满足多源约束和多样性要求。

Method: 将多输入约束建模为组合目标分布，使用变分推断近似；通过一系列退火分布执行逐步KL散度最小化，并引入上下文条件分解以降低解空间模态数，整合多个视频生成骨干网作为候选分布。

Result: 提出一种可控性更高的视频合成方法，通过将任务视作变分推断来近似组合分布，整合多个视频生成骨干网以同时满足多种约束，采用逐步KL散度最小化和上下文条件分解来缓解优化中的局部最优问题，提高了可控性、多样性和3D一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在满足指定元素精确控制同时保持未指定元素多样性方面优于先前工作，并改善了3D一致性。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Result: Proposed BYOL-IMNet (lightweight CNN) integrated with BYOL self-supervised learning achieved 99.89% test accuracy and 5.7 ms inference per image, outperforming other DL backbones.

Conclusion: CNN-BYOL混合方法能显著提高热成像下感应电机故障检测的准确性和实时性，适合工业在线监控。

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model
named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for
fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference
time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study
highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust
methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

Motivation: 弥补中心基方法对局部相似信息利用不足的问题，希望在保持对全局分布建模的同时融合局部相似性以提升哈希检索效果。

Method: 设计双分支网络（中心分支+成对分支），采用迭代互学习损失传递知识，并在网络中加入mixture-of-hash-experts模块实现跨分支的特征/哈希向量融合与信息流通。

Result: The paper proposes Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), integrating a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch to transfer local similarity knowledge into the center-based branch via iterative mutual learning; introduces a mixture-of-hash-experts module for cross-branch interaction; shows state-of-the-art results on benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过弱到强的互学框架和专家混合模块，中心分支能吸收局部相似信息而不牺牲建模全局结构，实验验证在多数据集上超越现有方法。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 电商产品图像中水印和促销文字影响展示效果，传统扩散修复方法在对象移除和领域适配上存在局限，需更鲁棒的商业化解决方案。

Method: Repainter结合空间抠图轨迹优化、注意力调制与GRPO，通过生成高奖励样本并抑制不想要的对象插入，同时采用复合奖励（全局/局部/语义）来指导训练。

Result: 在新构建的EcomPaint-100K数据集和EcomPaint-Bench基准上，Repainter在复杂场景下明显优于现有最先进方法，能够有效减少视觉伪影和奖励投机行为。

Conclusion: 本文提出Repainter，通过强化学习与空间抠图轨迹优化及组相对策略优化（GRPO），在电商图像去除水印和促销文字任务中表现优异。

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Conclusion: SyncHuman通过融合互补模型和设计专门的对齐与注入模块，在几何精度与视觉保真度上优于基线方法，特别在困难姿态下表现稳健。

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

TL;DR: 提出 ComGS——通过 SOPs 替代光线追踪实现高效可重光照重建，并用局部 360° 辐射场与扩散模型完成局部光照，达成实时、高质量的 Gaussian Splatting 物体-场景合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting 虽然能实现沉浸式渲染，但当把物体合成到场景时，因 baked 的外观与阴影信息导致不协调。要实现真实合成需要同时完成可重光照的物体重建和准确的场景光照估计。现有基于 Gaussian 的反演方法依赖光线追踪效率低，而学习方法对单视图预测光照又对视点敏感或无法建模复杂光传输，因此需要提出高效且鲁棒的方法。

Method: 方法包括两部分：1) 引入 SOPs：在场景中布置八面体结构的探针，存储环境光和遮挡信息，通过插值查询实现高效的 3D 光照/遮挡估计，替代基于 Gaussian 的光线追踪反演，提升重建效率并实现实时阴影；2) 光照估计与完成：在物体放置位置采集 360° 重建辐射场，并对一个扩散模型进行微调以完成并生成局部环境光，避免直接预测全场景光照和视角敏感性，从而得到更协调的物体外观与阴影。两部分结合到 ComGS 管线，实现快速编辑与实时渲染。

Result: ComGS 在速度和视觉质量上表现优异：重建阶段引入 SOPs 至少带来 2 倍速度提升；整体系统可在约 28 FPS 实时渲染，编辑仅需 36 秒；生成的合成结果在外观一致性与阴影细节上更自然、和谐。论文提供代码与数据集。

Conclusion: 本文提出 ComGS，通过引入 Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) 和基于场景局部环境光完成的扩散模型微调，实现了在 Gaussian Splatting 场景中高效且真实的 3D 物体-场景合成。SOPs 避免了昂贵的光线追踪，使重建速度至少提升 2 倍并支持实时阴影计算；局部光照完成策略简化了全场景光照估计，专注物体放置位置的 360° 辐射场以生成协调的光照。最终 ComGS 可在约 28 FPS 下实现真实感合成，编辑仅需 36 秒。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

*Yuang Meng,Xin Jin,Lina Lei,Chun-Le Guo,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出UltraLED，一个基于单帧短曝光RAW图像恢复超高动态范围（UHDR）细节的两阶段方法：先通过比值图进行曝光校正，再用明亮感知RAW去噪器增强暗区细节，并构建了9档曝光合成管线与数据集。与现有单幅方法相比，在合成与真实场景上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHDR场景（如夜间有光源）产生亮暗强差，RGB包围曝光容易导致对齐和鬼影问题；短曝光保留高光细节，但暗区噪声严重，RAW图像因更高位深和可建模噪声更适合从单帧恢复暗部细节，因此研究能否仅用单帧短曝光RAW重建UHDR。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 曝光校正模块：学习比值图对短曝光RAW进行曝光扩展以平衡亮暗，使高光不过曝且暗部可见；2) 亮度感知RAW去噪器：利用RAW更高位深与可预测噪声模型，针对扩展后的暗区进行去噪与细节恢复。训练数据通过设计9档曝光合成管线生成真实感UHDR对，并以最短曝光作为网络输入。

Result: 在合成与真实数据集上，UltraLED在亮度恢复与去噪性能上显著优于现有单帧方法，且避免了包围曝光的对齐/鬼影问题。

Conclusion: 只用单帧短曝光RAW图像，结合比值曝光校正与亮度感知RAW去噪，能够在动态场景下有效恢复UHDR场景的暗部细节与整体亮度平衡，避免对齐伪影，效果优于现有单帧方法。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

TL;DR: 用事件相机提供的高帧率运动先验约束低帧率RGB驱动的动态3D高斯点重建，通过LoCM微调事件流并进行几何感知的数据关联与伪标签策略，提升了大幅运动场景下的恢复效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低帧率RGB视频在大幅帧间运动时导致匹配不确定性，而事件相机能高频捕捉像素级运动轨迹但无颜色信息，二者互补：事件流为形变提供确定性约束，RGB提供外观与颜色，使得联合优化可在动态场景实现更鲁棒的3DGS重建。

Method: 1) 使用LoCM无监督微调框架，适配预训练事件光流估计器到特定未知场景，提取事件编码的运动先验；2) 提出几何感知数据关联方法，建立事件与3D高斯点的运动对应；3) 引入运动分解与帧间伪标签两项策略，稳定并增强优化；4) 共同优化RGB帧与事件流对动态3DGS的几何与形变场。

Result: 提出了一种将低帧率RGB视频与高帧率事件流联合用于重建动态图像化3D高斯点（3DGS）的框架，通过事件流提供的运动先验引导形变场优化，从而解决大幅帧间运动带来的不确定性。方法包括LoCM无监督微调事件光流估计器以提取场景相关运动先验，和几何感知的数据关联构建事件与高斯点的运动对应，辅以运动分解与帧间伪标签策略。实验证明在合成与真实场景上优于现有基于图像或事件的方法。

Conclusion: 事件流的轨迹可为帧间大运动提供确定性约束，结合几何感知的事件-高斯对应和事件流微调的运动先验，可有效引导动态3DGS的形变场优化，从而在大运动场景中提升重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

TL;DR: GTR-Bench提出了地图与多视角视频联合的地理时空推理基准，揭示了现有VLM在时空推理、时间预测和地图-视频对齐三方面的薄弱，最强模型仍大幅落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准要么关注自我视角（图像/视频），要么关注地图类图形上下文，缺乏同时考察地图与多视角视频联合地理时空智能的评估，然而这对交通管理、应急响应等场景至关重要。

Method: 作者构建了包含大规模摄像头网络的地理时空推理数据集，设计任务要求模型在地图与视频间多次切换视角、跨多视频联合推理以及对视频未观测到的时空区域进行推断。并在基准上评估了10余种流行VLM，开展详尽的错误分析。

Result: 在GTR-Bench上，即使最好的专有模型Gemini-2.5-Pro也仅取得34.9%，远低于人类78.61%。分析指出三大缺陷：空间时序上下文利用不均衡、时间预测能力弱、地图与多视角视频对齐理解不足。

Conclusion: 本文提出了GTR-Bench，一个面向地图与多视角视频联合推理的地理时空推理基准，展示了现有视觉-语言模型在该任务上的显著不足。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

TL;DR: 提出将起始-顶点与顶点-结束光流及幅值融合为MM-COF，并设计端到端FMANet以可学习方式自适应融合双阶段运动信息，显著提升微表情识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只计算起始帧到顶点帧的光流，忽略顶点到结束阶段的运动信息；微表情动作短暂、细微，完整的双阶段运动信息对识别至关重要，因此需要更全面的运动表示与可学习的融合机制。

Method: 首先构建了Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow（MM-COF）表示，将起始-顶点与顶点-结束两阶段的光流及其幅值进行融合，形成统一描述；在此基础上设计端到端网络FMANet，包含可学习的双阶段分析模块和幅值调制模块，并结合注意力机制自适应融合运动线索和聚焦显著面部区域进行分类。

Result: 在MMEW、SMIC、CASME-II与SAMM四个标准数据集上的实验表明，MM-COF与FMANet在识别准确率和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法，证明双阶段且幅值调制的可学习框架能提升微表情识别效果。

Conclusion: 提出的MM-COF与FMANet通过整合起始-顶点和顶点-结束两个阶段的光流信息以及幅值调制，有效提升了微表情识别性能，实验证明在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示虽然参数高效且兼容黑盒模型，但表达能力受限且在增加参数时容易过拟合，导致精度落后于其他适配方法。论文旨在通过引入更丰富的变换和合适的数据增强提升VP的表现与泛化能力。

Method: 提出将三种互补变换融合到视觉提示：1) 仿射变换以构建任务相关的提示区域同时保留图像原始信息；2) 颜色变换以突出与任务相关的视觉特征；3) 传统的像素加性提示。训练时结合TrivialAugment数据增强以缓解参数增多带来的过拟合。实验横向比较了不同VP方法、线性探测与端到端微调，在12个数据集与两种骨干模型上验证效果与稳健性。

Result: ACAVP在各种数据集上取得了VP方法的SOTA性能，平均优于线性探测；引入TrivialAugment使得某些数据集上性能提升多达12个百分点，且模型在分布偏移下表现更稳健，推理开销仍然很低。

Conclusion: ACAVP在12个图像分类数据集和两种模型架构上，作为视觉提示方法实现了最先进的精度，平均超越线性探测；引入TrivialAugment显著减少过拟合并能普适地提升现有VP方法的表现；在推理时保持很小的计算开销且对分布偏移更鲁棒。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14

next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an

Conclusion: PrismGS是可插拔的正则化框架，显著提高大尺度城市场景中3D Gaussian Splatting的视觉稳定性与质量，并保持与现有管线兼容性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable direct translation of isolated non-grammatic sign sequences to speech to reduce latency and error from multi-stage pipelines and serve educational/prompt interfaces

Method: End-to-end sign-to-speech translation using I3D and NMS

Result: Achieves Top-1 accuracies 72.01% (ASL-Citizen-1500) and 78.67% (WLASL-100); audio PESQ 2.67, STOI 0.73; intelligible speech generation

Conclusion: Direct sign-to-speech translation for isolated non-grammatic sequences is feasible and effective; the proposed NMS temporal detection and feature pipeline yield competitive recognition and intelligible audio without intermediate text.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

Conclusion: Using semantic priors as active geometric regularizers yields better reconstructions from sparse inputs, validated by extensive benchmarks; code released.

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test
large amounts of compounds. A key component for such systems is the automated
evaluation via machine learning models. In this paper, we address critical
challenges in this domain and demonstrate how representations learned via
self-supervised learning can effectively identify toxicant-induced changes. We
provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet
dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various
chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration
of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context
of the TOXBOX project.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XYZCylinder introduces a unified cylinder camera model and cylinder-plane feature lifting to improve generalization and accuracy in feedforward 3D reconstruction of driving scenes, achieving SOTA and zero-shot transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed view transformations limit generalization across different camera configurations; sparse 360° panoramic views and scene complexity reduce reconstruction accuracy.

Method: Feedforward cylinder-based unified camera modeling and hybrid representation lifting

Result: Proposal of XYZCylinder with Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) and Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) based hybrid representation; state-of-the-art performance and zero-shot generalization to other driving scenes.

Conclusion: UCCM plus CPFG hybrid representation enables robust, generalizable, and accurate feedforward reconstruction across diverse driving camera setups.

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

TL;DR: MARC通过检索式记忆和RL蒸馏高效压缩视频tokens，在保持接近原始性能的同时大幅降低计算、显存和延迟，适用于实时受限场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低视频视觉语言模型在从图像扩展到视频时的计算开销，同时保留推理能力和性能，解决现有训练免费压缩方法造成的信息丢失问题。

Method: 方法由两部分组成：Visual Memory Retriever（VMR）用于结构化检索关键视频片段（retrieve），以及Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization（C-GRPO）框架用于强化学习基础的蒸馏（compress），通过从教师模型提取推理信号训练学生模型在压缩token下保持性能。

Result: 提出MARC：采用检索-压缩策略，使用Visual Memory Retriever选择关键片段，并通过Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization（C-GRPO）进行基于强化学习的蒸馏，从教师模型向学生模型传递推理能力。实验在六个视频基准上显示，用仅一帧的tokens可实现近基线精度，视觉tokens减少95%，GPU内存减少72%，延迟降低23.9%。

Conclusion: MARC能在资源受限环境下实现高效实时视频理解，显著减少token数、显存占用和延迟，同时维持接近基线的准确率，适配视频问答、监控和自动驾驶等场景。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 本文提出ASBench，首个专门评估异常合成方法的基准框架，系统揭示现有合成方法的局限并提出改进方向。

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

TL;DR: 提出TTOM，一种训练免费、测试时优化和记忆机制的方法，通过在推理时加入并优化新参数以对齐时空布局，从而提升视频基础模型在组合场景（运动、数字、空间关系）上的表现；引入流式生成与可操作的参数化记忆，实现历史上下文维护与灵活操作；在两个基准上展示良好迁移与泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基础模型在组合任务（如运动、计数、空间关系）上表现欠佳，且现有方法通过对潜编码或注意力做逐样本干预效果有限或需训练；需要一种无需额外训练、推理时可调整的通用框架以提升文本-图像/视频的时空对齐。

Method: 在推理阶段为每个样本集成并优化额外参数，目标由通用的布局-注意力损失引导；把视频生成视为流式任务，使用参数化记忆保存并操作历史优化上下文（支持插入、读取、更新、删除），从而在不改动原模型权重下调整输出与时空布局一致。

Result: 在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准上，TTOM提高了组合视频生成的对齐与质量，表现出良好的转移性和泛化能力，且框架高效可扩展。

Conclusion: TTOM在无训练开销下通过测试时优化与记忆机制显著改善了视频生成的跨模态组合对齐，具有可扩展性与实用性，并在基准上验证了其有效性和迁移能力。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成多聚焦于像素级外观，缺乏对几何/深度和长期一致性的建模。自动驾驶等应用需要既高保真又能提供几何信息的多视角长序列视频生成与预测。

Method: 方法包括：1) 设计一个时空重建VAE，加入辅助4D重建任务微调编码器/解码器以更好捕捉3D结构与时间动态；2) 将微调后的VAE作为视频扩散模型的潜空间表示，进行条件视频生成（多视角/控制输入）；3) 联合训练或配合Gaussian Splatting Decoder对生成的潜在表示做几何重建以输出深度/4D场景。

Result: 在多个基准上，CVD-STORM在FID和FVD上显著优于基线，生成视频质量和时空一致性提升；此外，Gaussian Splatting Decoder成功重建动态场景几何，提供深度与4D结构信息。

Conclusion: CVD-STORM能在多控制条件下生成高质量、多视角的长时序视频，并提供有用的几何/深度信息，FID和FVD有显著改善，Gaussian Splatting解码器支持动态场景重建。

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The gap between existing text datasets (natural/documents) and anime scenes where text is stylized, irregular, and confusable with graphics motivates a new dataset.

Method: Collect large-scale anime images, annotate 4.2M text blocks with hierarchical labels and hard negatives, and benchmark state-of-the-art text detectors with cross-dataset evaluation showing improved performance on anime scenes.

Result: Created AnimeText: 735K images, 4.2M annotated text blocks, hierarchical annotations, hard negatives; models trained on it outperform those trained on existing datasets on anime text detection.

Conclusion: AnimeText fills a dataset gap and enables better anime text detection; training on it yields superior results compared to existing datasets.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection

Motivation: 雨量即时报预测受地球系统复杂性影响，现有非自回归方法在长时预测上表现受限且可能产生模糊或分布偏移，故需改进训练策略和引入概率模型以提升准确性与可靠性。

Method: 设计短到长时知识蒸馏，在训练时用短预测作为教师指导长预测，同时在损失函数中对强降水区域加权MSE以强调关键区域，之后将训练好的确定性模型嵌入到扩散框架以生成概率性输出。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了SimCast训练管线结合短到长时知识蒸馏和加权MSE损失以提高降水即时预报准确性，并将其与扩散模型融合为CasCast以产生概率性预测，显著提升了CSI等指标。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

TL;DR: 提出Latent Harmony：先用LH-VAE强化潜空间语义与高频等变性，再用HF-LoRA联合训练恢复高频细节，最终在UHD修复中兼顾效率与高质量重建，且支持可调的保真-感知折衷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHD修复需兼顾计算效率与高频细节保留；传统VAE在潜空间提供效率但高斯约束易丢失退化相关高频信息，导致重建质量下降，需在潜空间与重建阶段同时加强高频感知与语义一致性。

Method: 两阶段框架：阶段一LH-VAE对潜空间进行视觉语义约束、渐进退化扰动与潜等变训练以加强语义鲁棒性与高频重建能力；阶段二联合训练精炼VAE与修复模型，提出HF-LoRA（高频低秩适配）：编码器LoRA用高频对齐损失提升保真度，解码器LoRA用感知导向损失合成真实纹理，采用交替优化与选择性梯度传递以保留预训练潜结构。推理时通过可调参数α在保真度与感知质量间折衷。

Result: 在UHD及标准分辨率任务上，Latent Harmony取得了SOTA级别的综合性能，能在效率、感知质量与重建精度之间提供良好平衡，且推理时可通过α灵活调整。

Conclusion: Latent Harmony通过在潜空间正则化与高频感知重建间建立协同机制，有效缓解了VAE高频信息丢失问题，从而在超高清图像修复中实现效率与细节保留的平衡。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Abstract tags better for privacy when few tags available; object tags catch up with more tags. Guidance for future privacy classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate which tag type (object vs abstract) is better for image privacy classification, especially under tag budget constraints; improve interpretability and guide classifier design

Method: Analysis of methods and experiments

Result: Abstract tags outperform object tags when tag budget is limited; with larger tag sets, object tags become as useful; implications for tag selection and privacy classifiers

Conclusion: Tag type and quantity both affect image privacy classification; choose abstract tags when tag budget is small, otherwise object tags suffice

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在低光图像同时恢复高频细节与抑制严重噪声这一挑战性任务中，是否可以用轻量级CNN在保持较高性能的同时显著降低计算开销，以便于实际部署。

Method: 通过在相同任务上对比训练轮次、模型参数量和PSNR指标，评估SwinIR与标准轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务上的性能与效率差异。

Result: Transformer模型SwinIR达到了最高39.03 dB的PSNR，但需132个训练epoch；轻量级CNN达到了37.4 dB的PSNR，仅用10个epoch且模型尺寸小55倍以上，说明在资源受限场景中CNN具有较高性价比。

Conclusion: 尽管SwinIR在绝对性能上优于轻量级CNN，但后者在训练效率、模型大小和资源占用方面有显著优势，能以远低成本达到接近最优的复原效果，适合实际受限环境。

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

Motivation: Leverage event cameras' sparse, low-latency data to perform high-frequency 2D human pose estimation suitable for resource-constrained platforms

Method: Graph Neural Network on event-camera data

Result: Proposes GraphEnet using line-based event representation, novel offset vector learning and confidence-based pooling; first application of GNNs to event-based human pose estimation; code released

Conclusion: GraphEnet demonstrates feasibility of applying GNNs to event data for accurate, high-frequency single-person 2D pose estimation, enabling low-latency applications on constrained hardware.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

TL;DR: 提出RayFusion：利用协作者的射线占据信息进行射线级融合，减少摄像头深度歧义，显著提升协作视觉3D检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机是摄像头缺乏深度感导致的3D检测精度受限；通过引入协作者提供的射线占据信号，可以提供显式的深度线索而无需完整深度重建，降低通信带宽并提升协作感知鲁棒性。

Method: 方法核心是沿摄像机射线汇集来自协作者的占据概率（ray occupancy），在融合阶段利用这些占据信息抑制射线上不可信的检测响应，从而降低误报并提高定位精度；实现上包含射线生成、占据估计、跨车/路侧信息对齐与融合，以及基于占据重加权的检测头。

Result: RayFusion 提出了一种基于射线的协作视觉感知融合方法，通过利用来自协作者（如其他车辆或基础设施）的射线占据信息来改进纯摄像头系统的深度不确定性问题，从而减少沿摄像机射线的冗余和误报，提升3D目标检测性能。

Conclusion: RayFusion 有效利用跨智能体的占据信息缓解纯视觉感知中的深度模糊，实验表明在多项基准上优于现有方法，适用于提高车联网环境下的摄像头基础协作感知。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏像素级注释时，如何利用切片级弱标签做出准确且高效的脑部异常定位和检测。

Method: 第一阶段：Discriminative Dual Prompt Tuning（DDPT）从切片级标签生成高质量伪弱掩码；第二阶段：分割网络加入区域感知空间注意机制，利用固定的位置随机嵌入引导网络关注异常区域。

Result: 提出了一种两阶段弱监督脑MRI异常检测框架RASALoRE，包括基于双提示微调生成伪弱掩码和基于位置随机嵌入的区域感知空间注意分割网络，参数少于800万并在多个数据集上实现了SOTA性能提升。

Conclusion: RASALoRE在BraTS20/21/23和MSD数据集上相比现有WSAD方法显著提升异常检测性能，并且模型更轻量（<8M参数）和计算更高效。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出现有学习型图像润饰方法依赖大规模成对数据且作为黑盒，缺乏可解释性和适应性；提出训练免疫、白盒、可解释的图像润饰系统。

Method: 逐步润饰流程：视觉批评器检测输入与参考差别，生成局部/全局调整建议；代码生成器将建议转化为可执行图像编辑代码；通过多步迭代在人类类似的流程中进行润饰，并支持自然语言指令调节。

Result: 提出RetouchLLM：无训练、白盒、基于可执行代码的逐步润饰框架，包含视觉批评器和代码生成器，支持高分辨率、可控、自然语言交互。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM在多种润饰风格上泛化良好，提供可解释、可控的用户交互，适用于高分辨率图像且无需训练数据。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种分层ResNet，通过多分支和层级惩罚约束多时序多光谱影像分类，实现对宏、中、微类的有效区分并提升少数类表现，支持在新区域通过微调快速适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多光谱时间序列影像在不同语义层级上的分类困难，尤其是在样本有限且类层级不一致时，需要一个能利用类层级信息、提高微类判别能力并便于扩展的模型。

Method: 在ResNet中增加多分支输出分别对应不同语义层级，使用层级惩罚图在损失中对不符合层级的预测给予惩罚，按层级标签逐层训练或约束，使早期层学习宏类，中间层学习中类，后期层学习微类；网络模块化并可通过微调在目标区域适配。

Result: 提出了一种多时序的类驱动分层残差神经网络(ResNet)，在ResNet基础上增加多分支用于不同层级分类，并引入层级惩罚图来抑制不一致的层级转变，能更好地学习宏/中/微类特征，且通过模块化设计支持微调扩展。

Conclusion: 利用类层级标签训练网络不同层，使得早期层快速学习宏/中层通用特征，后期层专注微类判别；层级惩罚降低不合理层级跳变；模块化结构便于扩展和迁移微调，在亚马逊森林Sentinel-2时间序列上验证了对微类和少数类的提升效果。

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

TL;DR: RedFace is a real-world-oriented facial deepfake dataset built from commercial online deepfake services (9 platforms) with 60k+ images and 1k videos; it reveals current detectors' poor practicality and aids better evaluations


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deepfake detection benchmarks lack real-world specificity and diversity, limiting practical applicability; need dataset reflecting black-box commercial deepfake services used in the wild

Method: Dataset construction and evaluation

Result: Created RedFace dataset: >60k forged images, 1k manipulated videos generated via 9 commercial online platforms and bespoke algorithms; experiments show existing detectors fail in cross-domain and real-world scenarios; dataset analyses explain performance degradation

Conclusion: RedFace bridges gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deepfake threats by providing diverse, commercial-service-generated deepfakes; existing detection methods need improvement to handle real-world variability

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against
real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace
dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared
to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at:

TL;DR: NSG captures ratio of spatial gradients to temporal density changes to detect AI videos; uses diffusion models and MMD; shows strong performance improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-generated videos reach near-perfect realism, making detection difficult; need to model spatiotemporal dynamics and physical-law violations.

Method: Physics-driven detection via probability flow conservation

Result: Proposed Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG) using diffusion models, NSG-VD detection via MMD between NSG features; derived upper bound showing amplified discrepancies in generated videos; outperforms baselines by 16.00% Recall and 10.75% F1.

Conclusion: NSG-VD effectively detects generated videos by leveraging physics-inspired NSG features and theoretical bounds, demonstrating superior empirical results.

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

TL;DR: 提出DarkHash：无需访问训练数据即可向深度哈希模型植入后门，通过影子后门框架、双语义引导和拓扑对齐损失在保持检索精度的同时实现高成功率，并能对抗现有防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无数据访问的现实场景下，研究如何在不接触训练数据的情况下向深度哈希模型植入后门，同时保持模型原有检索性能。

Method: 构建影子后门攻击框架：使用替代数据集对受害模型的部分层进行微调以嵌入后门；引入双语义引导（保持原始检索语义并引导后门语义）与拓扑对齐损失（利用样本与邻域关系将被毒化样本和其邻居优化到目标样本）以提高攻击能力。

Result: 提出DarkHash，一种首个无数据（data-free）深度哈希后门攻击方法；设计了双语义引导的影子后门框架，通过仅微调模型特定层并使用替代数据集实现后门功能；引入拓扑对齐损失以同时对个体和邻域样本进行优化，显著提升攻击成功率；在多数据集、多模型和多哈希方法上表现优异，并能抵抗主流防御方法。

Conclusion: DarkHash证明了在无训练数据条件下仍能高效、稳健地向深度哈希模型植入后门，揭示了该领域新的安全威胁，促使未来在数据无关场景下设计更强的防御机制。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

TL;DR: Use 3D Gaussian Splatting to enforce multiview consistency between RGB and noisy segmentations, producing refined masks to augment training; this boosts face parsing on extreme poses with minimal supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address lack of labeled data for extreme head poses by generating consistent multiview segmentation masks without costly manual annotation

Method: Label refinement via 3D Gaussian Splatting

Result: Jointly fitting two 3DGS models (RGB and segmentation) yields multiview-consistent synthetic masks; fine-tuning on refined dataset improves accuracy on challenging poses while retaining standard-view performance; outperforms SOTA without ground-truth 3D labels using few initial images

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline provides a scalable, annotation-efficient way to synthesize pose-diverse, accurate segmentation labels, improving robustness of face parsing models in real-world extreme-angle scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

Motivation: 天然图像的强度增强忽视CT中HU的物理含义，可能产生伪影并损害泛化；需要针对CT特性设计的增强策略以提升在有限医学影像数据下的泛化能力。

Method: 提出Random windowing：在训练时随机采样窗宽和窗位并应用于HU强度，从而模拟不同造影阶段和对比度变化；进行消融分析和多数据集评估，比较当前最先进方法。

Result: This paper introduces Random windowing, a CT-specific intensity augmentation leveraging Hounsfield Units distribution to improve segmentation robustness, especially for liver tumor segmentation under variable contrast enhancement. It shows artifacts from naive natural-image augmentations and demonstrates superior performance across datasets.

Conclusion: 随机窗宽窗位能有效利用CT的物理强度意义，减少不合适增强带来的伪影并提升模型在低对比/时序失准图像上的分割性能，尤其在肝肿瘤分割任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce latency and improve motion-controllable image-to-video generation under few-step autoregressive setting

Method: Fine-tune + RL for AR video diffusion

Result: AR-Drag: a fine-tuned I2V model further improved by RL with trajectory reward, Self-Rollout to preserve Markov property, selective stochasticity for faster training; 1.3B params, better fidelity and motion alignment, lower latency than SOTA

Conclusion: AR-Drag effectively balances fidelity, motion control, and latency via fine-tuning and RL techniques, enabling real-time motion-controllable video generation with a compact model.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

Conclusion: 本文结论是：Video-LLMs 在时间维度上的注意力区分能力不足导致生成与视觉依据不一致的回答，提出的 TCAS 方法通过增强注意力的时间区分性显著提升了模型的时间逻辑一致性和时序定位性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Conclusion: UniMMVSR显著优于现有方法，在细节保真度和对多模态条件的一致性方面表现更好，并展示了与基础模型结合生成4K多模态引导视频的可行性。

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

TL;DR: MURE通过交替文本与视觉线索的CoT分解复杂编辑任务，并用深度置信剪枝多路径推理，显著提升复杂场景的图像编辑质量；并提供14K示例数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图像编辑方法在处理复杂对象交叉和细粒度空间关系时缺乏显式推理过程，导致精细像素级编辑困难。

Method: 设计Interleaved Text-Image CoT流程：每一步先产文本推理再生成对应的视觉cue（如位置mask或新内容表示）；在每步展开多条视觉推理路径并通过MMDC的奖励模型打分，剪掉低分分支，最终串联生成高质量编辑结果；并构建并公开CoT-Edit-14K用于训练和评估。

Result: 提出MURE框架，通过交替的文本-图像Chain-of-Thought实现多模态推理编辑，并引入MMDC用于基于奖励模型的分支剪枝，提升编辑精度与一致性，同时发布CoT-Edit-14K数据集。

Conclusion: 交替文本-图像推理和基于奖励的多路径可信度剪枝能有效分解复杂编辑任务，减少幻觉并提高高保真编辑效果，在多个基准上显著改进。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自举算法逐步重新对齐训练样本以实现在无对齐先验下的规范化，对任意紧凑群给出收敛性，并在四个FGVC基准上优于等变与传统规范化方法，性能接近数据增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FGVC needs sensitivity to subtle cues and robustness to spatial transformations; geometric biases/noise (orientations, scales) are problematic; existing fixes (augmentation or equivariant architectures) have drawbacks; canonicalization could help but requires aligned data which is lacking.

Method: 设计一种迭代对齐算法：在每次迭代中使用当前模型估计变换将样本对齐，更新模型并降低样本方差；在紧凑群上证明在温和条件下的收敛性，并在实验中对比多种基线。

Result: A bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples, reducing variance and recovering alignment assumption; convergence guarantees for compact groups; empirical success on four FGVC benchmarks outperforming equivariant and canonicalization baselines and matching augmentation.

Conclusion: 自举对齐能在无对齐先验的情形下恢复对齐假设，提升FGVC表现且保留模型表达能力；理论与实验证明其有效性。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

*Haoran Yu,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructUDrag fuses object-dragging and text editing using energy-based guidance and shared gradients to enable precise relocation and semantic edits


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of text-based and object-dragging image editing methods by combining them

Method: Two-branch diffusion framework: moving-reconstruction branch with energy-based gradient guidance and cross-attention refinement; text-driven editing branch sharing gradients; use DDPM inversion and noise-map priors to preserve structure

Result: InstructUDrag enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-driven editing with two synergistic branches and DDPM inversion

Conclusion: InstructUDrag offers flexible, high-fidelity edits with precise object relocation and semantic control

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineDual通过三阶段（自学习、交互距离自适应、教师引导细化）建模动态层级交互，从个体到整体生成更细致的双人动作，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用人类交互的动态性（随距离变化的动作）和层级性（从个体到双人再到整体运动），提升双人动作生成质量。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) Self-Learning：用大模型把整体文本拆成个体文本并对齐个体文本与动作特征；2) Adaptive Adjustment：预测交互距离并用交互感知图网络在个体间建模动态交互；3) Teacher-Guided Refinement：用整体文本特征引导细化整体动作特征并生成最终动作。

Result: 提出FineDual方法，包含自学习、动态自适应和教师引导三阶段，分别对齐个体文本与动作、基于交互距离预测建模交互、以及用整体文本细化动作，在双人动作数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FineDual有效地利用动态和层级交互特性，生成更精细、更高质量的双人动作，实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 引入自适应触发的梯度校准（AdaGC），配合Mixup与双EMA伪标签生成，解决遥感单正多标签学习的标注模糊与噪声问题，取得SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感影像的多标签语义更丰富但标注成本高，单正多标签学习作为可扩展替代引入监督歧义与噪声问题，需专门方法提升鲁棒性和标签恢复能力。

Method: 核心方法为梯度校准（GC）结合Mixup与双指数移动平均（EMA）用于稳健伪标签生成；基于训练动态设计一个理论支撑的指示器，在暖启动后触发GC，从而避免早期过度正则化并抑制噪声过拟合。

Result: 本文提出AdaGC，一种针对遥感影像的单正多标签学习（SPML）方法，通过梯度校准结合Mixup与双EMA生成稳健伪标签，提高在标注稀缺/噪声场景下的多标签恢复能力。方法在两数据集与两类噪声设置下达到SOTA，表现稳健。

Conclusion: AdaGC能有效缓解SPML中的监督歧义与噪声过拟合，通过训练动态指示器在暖启动后自适应启用梯度校准，提升多标签恢复性能并在多种噪声/数据集上达到或超越现有方法。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NTN-Diff，一种频率感知的空文本(text-null)引导扩散模型，用于文本指导图像修复，通过在去噪过程中分离中低频带并分阶段（早期/晚期）处理，实现对未遮挡区域的保留与遮挡区域的语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到不同频率带对文本提示的鲁棒性不同，且中低频带的混叠导致未遮挡区域保留与语义一致性难以兼顾，因此提出基于频率解耦的方案。

Method: 对扩散去噪过程按时序划分为早期（高层噪声）和晚期（低层噪声）阶段，在去噪过程中解耦中低频带；利用mid频带在文本引导下的稳定语义对null-text过程引导低频带去噪，随后在晚期进行文本引导低频带微调，从而保持未遮挡区域并实现跨区频率语义一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明NTN-Diff在保持未遮挡区域细节同时提升遮挡区域语义一致性方面优于现有文本引导扩散方法。

Conclusion: NTN-Diff通过频率分解和分阶段去噪有效解决了文本引导图像修复中未遮挡区域保留与遮挡区域语义一致性的冲突，实验证明优于现有最先进扩散模型。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态与智能数据增强提高了指称理解的鲁棒性，尤其在复杂或混杂环境下表现更好

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Neural Exposure Fields(NExF)，在3D空间为每个点学习一个最佳曝光值以联合优化曝光和场景表示，实现对强曝光变化场景的鲁棒高质量重建与视图合成；避免多曝光或后处理，训练更快，在多项基准上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于神经场的方法在含强烈曝光变化的真实捕获数据上质量下降，因为传统相机在2D层面选择曝光无法保证跨视图一致性；因此需要在3D层面建模曝光以获得一致的外观重建。

Method: 引入一个神经曝光场（NExF），对每个3D点预测最优曝光值，结合一个条件机制在训练中同时优化场景隐式表示和曝光场，从而在渲染时自适应调整曝光，直接在3D层面处理曝光变化，无需多曝光输入或后处理。

Result: 在真实世界复杂高动态范围数据集上，NExF训练更快并在多个基准上达到或超越最优基线，报告中称在若干任务上优于最佳基线超过55%。

Conclusion: 通过在3D上预测并联合优化曝光场与场景表示，NExF在高动态范围与曝光变化大的真实场景中实现了更一致且高质量的3D重建与视图合成，显著优于现有方法并加速训练。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

*Cilin Yan,Jingyun Wang,Guoliang Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出长程时序上下文注意力机制(LTCA)：通过堆叠稀疏的膨胀窗口时序注意力和随机全局key采样，并引入全局query，与视频-语言特征交互以聚合全局上下文，从而提升指示性视频分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么使用全帧注意力，要么堆叠密集局部注意力，二者在局部性与全局性之间取舍不佳且计算复杂度随视频长度显著增长，需一种高效编码长程时序上下文的机制。

Method: 设计了两方面的全局上下文聚合策略：1) 堆叠稀疏局部注意力——在帧间采用膨胀窗口注意力以平衡局部与全局，并在多层堆叠中实现全局视野；同时为每个query随机从全局池中采样少量keys以增强全局性；2) 引入一个全局query与其它query交互以直接编码全局上下文。

Result: 在四个指向视频分割基准上取得SOTA，MeViS val和test(?)数据集分别提升11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA在四个RVOS基准上达到新的SOTA，特别在MeViS数据集上分别提升11.3%和8.3%。证明通过稀疏局部+随机全局采样与全局query能高效且有效地编码长程时序上下文。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖通用点云特征提取器，忽视3D数据特有问题（稀疏性、噪声、几何歧义），导致学习到的3D特征缺乏语义一致的功能边界；因此希望通过引入2D VFM的丰富语义来弥补3D特征的语义空缺。

Method: 提出Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT)作为预训练策略，将3D编码器与从2D图像提升（lifted）而来的语义对齐，联合优化重建、相似性（affinity）和多样性损失；基于此预训练骨干，设计Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST)，将多模态提示与CMAT预训练特征融合以生成提示感知的分割图。

Result: 在标准基准上进行了大量实验，显示该框架在3D可用性分割任务上取得新的最先进（SOTA）结果。

Conclusion: 该论文提出通过将2D大规模视觉基础模型的语义知识迁移到3D，解决传统点云编码器在稀疏、噪声与几何模糊下导致的功能边界不清问题，从而提升3D可用性分割性能。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo通过数据无关的后训练自动将部分自注意力层替换为线性注意力，并用ADM目标在采样轨迹任意步对分布进行匹配，从而在保持质量的前提下显著加速视频扩散生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的自注意力在序列长度上复杂度为二次方，带来高昂计算成本；直接用线性注意力替换需要昂贵的预训练，且线性注意力表达性有限，尤其在视频的时空建模上困难。因此需要一种无需数据且能保留性能的后训练方法来替换注意力模块以降低推理开销。

Method: (1) 通过把层选择问题视为二元分类，实施选择性迁移，自动决定可替换层并逐步替换为线性注意力；(2) 设计anytime distribution matching (ADM)目标，沿采样轨迹任意时间步对生成分布进行对齐以恢复性能；(3) 在无数据的后训练设定下对模型进行微调并进行短步蒸馏以进一步压缩推理步骤。

Result: LinVideo提出了一种高效、无数据的后训练框架，用于在视频扩散模型中将若干自注意力层替换为线性注意力以降低计算成本，同时保持原模型性能。方法上，作者首先发现不同层的可替换性差异明显，将层选择问题建模为二元分类，提出了“选择性迁移”（selective transfer）以自动并渐进地转换层。为克服现有目标函数在迁移过程中的低效与无效，提出了anytime distribution matching (ADM)目标，通过对采样轨迹上任意时间步的样本分布进行对齐来恢复模型性能并提高效率。实验证明，LinVideo可实现1.25-2.00倍加速，同时保持生成质量，且经4步蒸馏的模型在延迟上可实现15.92倍减少而视觉质量仅有极小下降。

Conclusion: LinVideo能在无需额外数据或从头预训练的情况下，有选择地将自注意力替换为线性注意力，ADM目标是关键使迁移过程有效，最终实现显著的计算与延迟提升且仅带来极小的质量损失。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater
images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light
or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

TL;DR: 用引导扩散生成高光谱样本，配合轻量Transformer、加权损失与优化的余弦方差调度器，在小样本下提升森林分类性能并稳定训练。


<details>

Motivation: 高光谱新卫星与深度学习促使精细地物分类，但标注样本少造成过拟合，需用可稳定训练的小样本生成增强方法提高泛化。

Method: 使用轻量级Transformer作为扩散模型的骨干，通过条件/引导生成高光谱数据，结合改进的加权交叉熵损失和优化的余弦方差调度器进行训练，最后用生成样本扩充训练集并进行分类评估。

Result: 提出了一种基于引导扩散模型的数据增强方法，使用轻量级Transformer网络在小标注数据集上训练并引入改进的加权损失函数和余弦方差调度器，在PRISMA高光谱影像的10类森林分类任务上优于其它增强方法，且训练更稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法在小样本高光谱分类任务上能生成有助于泛化的样本，提升平均与加权平均精度，并改善生成模型训练的稳定性。

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVideo unifies diverse video generation/editing tasks via a dual-stream MLLM+MMDiT architecture, achieving SOTA-level results, task composition, and cross-modal transfer from images to video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend unified multimodal instruction modeling from image domain to video, enabling versatile generation/editing with consistent visuals

Method: Dual-stream unified video modeling (MLLM + MMDiT)

Result: Matches or surpasses SOTA on text/image-to-video generation, in-context generation and editing; supports task composition and zero-shot transfer of image editing skills to video; supports visual-prompt-guided generation

Conclusion: Dual-stream unified modeling enables accurate instruction understanding and consistent video synthesis, allowing unified training across tasks and enabling generalization to novel video editing and composition scenarios. Briefly: UniVideo is a general, effective framework for unified video generation and editing.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LFC：在源数据不可用的情况下，通过‘由易到难’与‘由源到目标’两条课程策略，促进模型平滑迁移并改进伪标签学习，在眼底与息肉分割任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有源无关域适配侧重伪标签精炼但忽视学习过程，逐步的从源到目标及由易到难的学习策略能提供更稳定有效的知识迁移，尤其在医疗图像对隐私敏感的场景更有价值。

Method: 设计两条课程：1) easy-to-hard：根据样本难度排序，先用易样本训练再逐步增加难样本；2) source-to-target：构造平滑的迁移过程（可能通过权重或信念逐步转移），并结合伪标签精炼与训练策略实现目标域适配。

Result: Proposes curriculum-based source-free domain adaptation (LFC) for medical image segmentation, combining easy-to-hard sample curriculum and source-to-target curriculum to stabilize progressive transfer; achieves SOTA on fundus and polyp segmentation datasets.

Conclusion: LFC在不使用源数据的条件下，通过双重课程设计改善了域适应稳定性与性能，实验显示优于当前方法并达SOTA。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

*Zeqing Wang,Xinyu Wei,Bairui Li,Zhen Guo,Jinrui Zhang,Hongyang Wei,Keze Wang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VideoVerse，一個關注事件級時間因果與世界知識的T2V評測集，含300個提示、815事件、793題二元評估，並用QA+VLM對齊人類偏好進行評估，對現有模型做系統分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提出一個全面的評測基準，以檢驗文本到影片（T2V）模型是否理解事件級時間因果與世界知識，因為現有基準無法區分最新模型且缺乏因果與世界知識評估。

Method: 收集多領域真實影片並抽取事件描述，第三方註釋者將事件改寫成T2V提示；為每提示設計十個維度的二元問題（動態與靜態）；使用現代視覺-語言模型建立QA式、人類偏好對齊的自動評估流水線；在該基準上評估多個SOTA開源及閉源T2V模型。

Result: 構建VideoVerse基準：收集300條跨領域提示，包含815個事件和793個二元評估問題，設計十個評估維度（動態/靜態屬性），並用視覺-語言模型實現基於人類偏好對齊的問答評估流程，對多個SOTA開源與閉源T2V模型進行系統評估。

Conclusion: 現有T2V生成器在理解事件級時間因果與世界知識方面仍有顯著差距，VideoVerse可作為未來改進與評估的標準化基準。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出可扩展的sCM实现（FlashAttention-2 JVP），发现sCM在细节生成上不足，提出rCM加入score distillation正则，能在大模型与视频上1-4步生成高质量多样样本，优于DMD2，速度提升15-50x。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scale continuous-time consistency distillation to large image/video diffusion models, overcome JVP computation and benchmark limits.

Method: 实现并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP内核以支持大模型sCM训练；分析误差来源和目标特性；将score distillation作为长跳正则器整合进连续时间一致性模型，训练并在大规模文本到图像/视频模型上验证。

Result: Develop FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel enabling sCM training on >10B models; identify sCM quality limits; propose score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM) that adds score distillation regularizer; validate on large models up to 14B and 5s videos, matching/surpassing DMD2 in quality and better diversity, producing high-fidelity samples in 1-4 steps and 15-50x speedup.

Conclusion: rCM是一个实用且理论有据的大规模扩散蒸馏框架，兼顾质量和多样性，且高效。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality
metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning
or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate
high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling
by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and
theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion
distillation.

### [80] [Gaze on the Prize: Shaping Visual Attention with Return-Guided Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08442)
*Andrew Lee,Ian Chuang,Dechen Gao,Kai Fukazawa,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce Gaze on the Prize: a foveal attention mechanism trained with return-difference-based contrastive learning to focus on task-relevant pixels, yielding large gains in sample efficiency and robustness in visual RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional images contain sparse task-relevant pixels; focusing on them improves sample efficiency and stability. Inspired by human foveation, use agent return differences as self-supervised signal to learn where to attend.

Method: Return-guided contrastive foveal attention for visual RL

Result: Learnable gaze trained via return-guided contrastive triplets improves sample efficiency up to 2.4x and solves tasks baseline fails on ManiSkill3, without changing base algorithm or hyperparameters.

Conclusion: Return-guided contrastive learning enables an attention mechanism to highlight outcome-relevant visual features, markedly improving visual RL performance across manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于提出一个模块化且确定性的图像处理流水线，能同时完成图像简化（海报化）、增强（色彩、亮度、锐化）和几何特征提取，以满足实时视觉分析和计算机视觉任务的需求。

Method: 方法由模块化子模块组成：1）灰度八级量化的逐步强度变换；2）RGB与YCrCb直方图均衡进行色彩增强；3）HSV值通道调整用于亮度控制；4）3x3卷积核图像锐化；5）双向变换流水线（非锐化掩膜、伽马校正、噪声放大）；6）几何特征提取（Canny边缘、Hough直线、Harris角点、形态学窗口及球杆隔离）。根据不同色彩空间和参数顺序评估性能。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本中心的多模态LLM难以在开放词汇场景区分语义相似动作，需引入细粒度视觉证据与工具辅助推理以降低跨模态幻觉。

Method: 1) 将动作分解为判别性子动作进行细粒度匹配；2) 动态调用领域工具进行跨模态交互；3) 设计分层奖励（工具效率、子动作相关性、结构一致性）进行无监督优先子动作模式学习；4) 在多个数据集上进行评估。

Result: Paper proposes Video-STAR: decomposes actions into sub-motions and uses tool-augmented RL with hierarchical reward to improve open-vocabulary action recognition (OVAR). Claims improved performance on multiple datasets and reduced cross-modal hallucination.

Conclusion: Video-STAR通过子动作分解与工具增强RL，实现了从文本先验到视觉推理的迁移，显著提升了开放词汇动作识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文引入视觉象似性挑战（视频基准），用三项任务评估视觉-语言模型从动态手势中恢复形式-意义映射：手形/位置预测、透明度（从形式推意义）、象似性评分。对13个VLM在零/少样本及荷兰手语数据集上的评测表明：模型在手形和位置预测上能部分恢复细节但不及人类；在透明度任务上远低于人类；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分有中等相关；手形/位置预测能力与象似性判断相关。结论建议引入以人为中心的信号与具身学习以改进多模态视觉接地。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 签名语言中象似性普遍存在，提供了一个自然的视觉接地测试平台。挑战是让VLM从动态人体动作（非静态环境）中恢复形式-意义映射，从而评估模型的视觉-语言对齐能力。

Method: 构建一个视频基准（Visual Iconicity Challenge），将心理语言学测量方法适配为三项评估任务：1) 音系签名形式预测（手形、位置等）；2) 透明度评估（从视觉形式推测意义）；3) 分级象似性评分。对13个最先进的VLM在零/少样本设置上评估，并与人类基线在荷兰手语数据上比较。

Result: 见下

Conclusion: 视觉象似性对多模态模型的视觉接地是重要且可测的，但现有VLM在从动态人体动作恢复形式-意义映射方面仍有显著差距，需结合人类监督和具身学习改进。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: MoA-VR 通过模拟专业人员的分工与推理流程，提出了一个由三个代理组成的视频修复系统：降质识别、路由与修复、修复质量评估。构建了高分辨率视频降质识别基准并用视觉-语言模型实现识别；用大语言模型驱动的自适应路由器学习工具调用策略；构建Res-VQ数据集并设计VLM为核心的视频质量评估器。实验显示在客观指标和感知质量上均超越基线，展示了多模态与模块化推理在通用视频修复中的潜力。

Conclusion: MoA-VR 证明通过多模态（VLM）与大模型驱动的自适应路由，可实现对复杂、混合降质场景的鲁棒修复，且专门的VQA评估能更准确反映修复效果，为通用视频修复系统提供了可行范式。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

TL;DR: 识别并利用ViT中的高范数视觉token（attention sinks），通过训练前和训练式方法增强LLM对这些语义信号的利用，显著改善视觉推理表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究ViT中高范数视觉token（ViT attention sinks）在LVLM中的作用及其信息传递到LLM的有效性，并提升其利用方式

Method: 分析方法

Result: 发现这些高范数sink token携带高层语义，有助于LLM理解与推理；提出训练前/训练中方法显著提升多种LVLM的视觉推理性能

Conclusion: ViT attention sinks包含重要高层语义信息，传统LVLM常忽视；通过显式利用这些tokens可有效提升视觉理解与推理，建议在LVLM设计中重视并进一步研究这些视觉信号的桥接与利用。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于语义场景图的点云深度压缩框架：将点云分解为语义一致的补丁，用语义感知编码器（结合FiLM）编码为紧凑潜在表示，折叠解码器在图节点属性和潜在特征引导下重建。实验证明在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes上可将数据量减小多达98%，同时保持结构和语义保真，并可用于多机器人位姿图优化与地图合并，轨迹和对齐效果接近原始激光雷达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在带宽受限和连接不稳定的多机器人/边缘-云系统中，高效传输点云对集中或分布式感知至关重要；传统方法在压缩率与语义/结构保真之间权衡较差，故提出语义驱动的深度压缩方案。

Method: 1) 将点云分割为语义一致补丁并构建语义场景图；2) 用语义感知编码器（通过FiLM进行条件化）将每个补丁编码为紧凑潜在向量；3) 基于folding的解码器，结合图节点属性和潜在特征重建点云补丁；4) 端到端训练以同时保持结构和语义保真。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI与nuScenes上实现了最先进的压缩率（最高可达98%数据减少），在保留语义标签和几何细节方面优于基线，同时在多机器人位姿图优化和地图合并任务中，基于压缩数据的轨迹精度与地图对齐接近使用原始数据的结果。

Conclusion: 方法能显著压缩点云数据（最高约98%），在保留语义与几何信息方面表现良好，且支持下游多机器人任务，实现与原始点云相当的定位和地图合并效果。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出并证明了预训练模型中存在可普适微调的“胜出切片”现象（由谱平衡与高任务能量导致），并据此提出无新增参数的SliceFine方法，在多个任务上实现与现有PEFT同等性能但更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释为何在大型预训练模型中，仅微调少量随机选取的权重子集就能有效适配下游任务，寻求为现有PEFT方法提供理论依据并提出更高效的微调策略。

Method: 理论上证明预训练模型的权重切片具有相似的特征谱（spectral balance）且主干表示保留丰富的任务相关信息（high task energy），据此提出“通用胜出切片假设”。在实践中设计SliceFine，仅选择并微调若干权重切片（不添加额外参数）并在语言与视觉任务上进行实证对比。

Result: 理论上给出谱平衡与高任务能量两个足以导致通用胜出切片现象的条件；提出的SliceFine在多项语言与视觉基准上达到与最先进PEFT方法相当的性能，同时在训练速度、显存占用与模型大小方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 预训练网络中存在“通用胜出切片”特性：在随机选取的小子网（切片）上微调即可实现下游任务适配。该特性由谱平衡与高任务能量两大现象驱动，从而为参数高效微调（PEFT）提供理论基础。基于此提出SliceFine，通过仅更新部分原始权重切片并不引入新参数，实现与现有PEFT方法相当的性能，同时在训练速度、内存效率与模型紧凑性上显著改进。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

TL;DR: FlexTraj uses a point-based motion representation (segmentation ID, trajectory ID, optional color) and a sequence-concatenation conditioning scheme plus annealing training to achieve flexible, alignment-agnostic image-to-video generation with efficient inference and strong control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable flexible point-trajectory control for image-to-video generation with dense/sparse control and efficient conditioning

Method: Analysis of methods

Result: Unified point-based motion representation and sequence-concatenation conditioning; annealing training strategy; supports various applications with strong controllability and efficient inference

Conclusion: FlexTraj provides multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control enabling motion cloning, drag-based editing, interpolation, camera redirection, action control, and mesh animation, with faster convergence and robust inference.

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLM在空间推理上表现欠佳，作者认为原因是缺乏从感知到理解再到推理的分层学习过程，直接学习空间推理难以形成稳健能力。

Method: 构建了包含26,610条样本的SpatialLadder-26k数据集，覆盖目标定位、单图、多视角和视频空间任务；设计三阶段训练流程：1）目标定位建立空间感知；2）多维空间任务培养空间理解；3）通过强化学习（可验证奖励）增强复杂推理；训练得到3B参数的SpatialLadder模型并评估基准。

Result: SpatialLadder在空间推理基准上平均提升23.4%（相比基线），超越GPT-4o 20.8%和Gemini-2.0-Flash 10.1%，对域外基准也有7.2%提升。

Conclusion: 该论文提出了通过分层、逐步训练来增强VLM的空间推理能力，最终模型SpatialLadder在多项基准上取得显著提升。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高基于指令的图像编辑模型对编辑强度的精细控制，使用户能在从不变到完全修改的连续范围内调整编辑程度。

Method: 在现有编辑模型基础上增加一个标量编辑强度输入，训练一个轻量投影网络将标量与文本指令映射为模型的调制系数；构建并筛选合成的图像-编辑-指令-强度四元组数据用于训练。

Result: 提出Kontinuous Kontext模型，通过新增标量编辑强度输入并训练轻量投影网络将该标量与指令映射到模型调制系数，实现可连续调节的编辑强度；并通过合成数据集与筛选步骤训练模型，适用于风格化、属性、材质、背景、形状等多种编辑类型。

Conclusion: Kontinuous Kontext提供了一种统一且轻量的方法，使指令驱动的图像编辑具备连续、细粒度的强度控制，适用于多种编辑操作而无需针对具体属性单独训练。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

TL;DR: Paper builds a synthetic benchmark for long-chain reflective reasoning, creates 100k reflective traces and proposes AHPO hybrid training to improve MLLMs, yielding significant gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MLLMs lack long-chain reflective reasoning required for complex tasks; create benchmark and methods to improve.

Method: Empirical benchmark + data synthesis + training strategy

Result: Constructed MM-HELIX (1,260 samples), MM-HELIX-100K dataset; proposed AHPO training; applied to Qwen2.5-VL-7B achieving +18.6% on MM-HELIX and +5.7% on other tasks.

Conclusion: Reflective reasoning can be taught to MLLMs via tailored datasets and adaptive hybrid optimization, improving specialized and general reasoning performance.

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity
for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

TL;DR: 构建了跨文化的视频社会规范基准 VideoNorms（美中两国，1000+实例），用人-AI协作标注并评估多种 VideoLLM，发现模型在识别规范违规、非言语证据、以及中国文化场景中表现较差，呼吁增强文化归因训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着 VideoLLM 的全球部署，模型需具备文化背景理解与落地的规范判断能力，当前缺乏适当基准来评估模型的文化意识，故提出 VideoNorms 来填补这一测评空白。

Method: 采用人-AI协作：基于理论的提示由教师模型生成候选标注，随后由受训人类专家验证并修正；数据由成对（视频片段，规范）构成，标注包含言语行为类别、遵守/违反标签、以及言语/非言语证据。对多个开源 VideoLLM 进行评测并聚合分析差异。

Result: VideoNorms 引入了一个文化感知评测集，涵盖美中两国1000+段视频与社会规范标注，包含言语行为理论、是否遵守/违反规范标签、以及言语/非言语证据。构建采用人-AI协作：教师模型生成候选标注，人工专家校验修正。基准测试多个开源 VideoLLM，总结出常见趋势：模型在识别规范违反上表现差于遵守；对中国文化表现劣于美国文化；在提供非言语证据方面难度大于言语证据；难以准确识别与言语行为对应的具体规范；在正式、非幽默语境下表现较差（与人类相反）。该工作强调需进行文化驱动的视频语言模型训练，提出数据集与框架来部分填补这一空白。

Conclusion: VideoNorms 揭示当前 VideoLLM 在文化敏感性和非言语理解上的显著短板，尤其在识别违规行为与中国文化语境中，并提供了数据与流程以支持未来文化驱动的模型改进。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Conclusion: ARTDECO在八个室内外基准上实现了接近逐场景优化方法的重建质量、类似SLAM的交互性能和与前馈系统相当的鲁棒性，表明在实时场景数字化中兼顾效率与精度是可行的。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

Motivation: 现有记忆持久化VLN方法缺乏有效的记忆访问机制且多只存储环境观测，忽视了包含决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 构建语言条件的世界模型用于想象未来导航状态，提出混合视点级记忆同时存储环境观察与导航行为模式，并设计经验增强导航模型通过专门编码器整合检索到的记忆。

Result: 在10个测试场景的内存持久化VLN基准上均显著优于基线，在IR2R上SPL提高5.4%，训练速度提升8.3倍，推理内存减少74%，并展示了想象导向检索的巨大潜力（73.3% vs 93.4%上界）。

Conclusion: 本文提出Memoir，通过基于显式记忆的想象检索机制，实现了更高效的记忆持久化视觉—语言导航（VLN）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

Motivation: 提出统一任意时空补全任务，解决因因果VAE导致的时间歧义，允许像在视频画布上绘画一样用任意补丁控制视频生成。

Method: 在冻结的潜在视频扩散模型上采用无新参数的In-Context Conditioning（ICC）范式，提出混合条件策略：空间通过零填充实现放置，时间通过Temporal RoPE Interpolation分配连续的分数位置以解决VAE时间歧义。并构建VideoCanvasBench评估基准。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Summarize motivation

Method: Please analyze the methods and contributions of the paper

Result: Summarize results

Conclusion: Provide concise conclusion and potential limitations

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

TL;DR: ResAD reframes trajectory prediction to residuals from an inertial reference and normalizes residuals to balance optimization, yielding state-of-the-art NAVSIM PDMS 88.6 with a simple diffusion policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end autonomous driving systems face spatio-temporal imbalance in trajectory data, leading to optimization difficulties, spurious correlations, and prioritization of uncertain distant predictions over immediate safety.

Method: Predict residual deviations from a deterministic inertial reference; apply point-wise normalization to residuals to re-weight loss and prevent long-horizon errors from dominating; use vanilla diffusion policy with two denoising steps for trajectory sampling.

Result: Proposed ResAD: predicts residual deviations from an inertial reference and applies Point-wise Normalization to re-weight losses, improving learning and reducing effect of distant uncertain waypoints.

Conclusion: ResAD simplifies learning by using inertial counterfactuals and normalized residuals, improving causal inference and handling spatio-temporal imbalance, leading to better performance and safety in E2EAD.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

Motivation: 探索原生端到端训练的多模态大语言模型(MLLM)，在数据受限的实际设置下研究其设计空间与规模化特性，以替代现有的分段组合训练范式。

Method: 系统化分析设计空间以选出最优元架构，实证探索视觉编码器与LLM的规模效应，基于发现设计简洁成本效益高的训练配方并研发NaViL，在多模态基准上进行评测。

Result: 提出最优元架构并发现视觉编码器与LLM间存在正相关的规模关系；基于此提出原生MLLM——NaViL，并用简洁、低成本的训练方案实现，在14个多模态基准上表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 原生端到端训练在数据受限情境下可行且有效；视觉编码器与LLM的规模需协调增长；NaViL为一种高效成本方案，为未来原生MLLM研究提供指导。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

TL;DR: 针对稀疏视角问题，D^2GS通过“基于深度与密度的Dropout”抑制相机近距离过拟合，并用“距离感知保真增强”提升远场欠拟合，显著提升稳定性与重建质量。


<details>

Motivation: 在稀疏视角下，3DGS面临相机近处高密度高斯导致过拟合及远处高斯不足导致欠拟合，两者共同导致性能下降与不稳定性，需同时抑制近场过拟合并增强远场覆盖。

Method: 1) 深度与密度引导的Dropout：根据高斯体素的深度和密度自适应掩盖冗余高斯以缓解近场过拟合；2) 距离感知保真增强：对远场欠拟合区域施加目标监督以提高重建质量。

Result: D^2GS提出了针对稀疏视角下3D Gaussian Splatting(3DGS)表现退化的两类失败模式并给出相应解决方案。

Conclusion: D^2GS在多数据集实验中改善了稀疏视角下的视觉质量与鲁棒性，并提出了衡量高斯分布稳定性的新指标。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Motivation: 动机是缓解高质量多模态轨迹稀缺和人工标注成本高的问题，通过自动合成和自动偏好生成实现可扩展的训练数据以提升VLM的工具使用能力。

Method: 方法包含三部分：1) 构建M-TRACE数据集（28.5K任务、177K经过验证的轨迹）用于模仿学习；2) 在该数据集上微调得到MATRIX Agent作为控制器；3) 使用自动生成的11K偏好对Pref-X进行逐步偏好学习以进一步对齐模型。

Conclusion: 本文提出了一种以视觉为中心的代理微调框架，通过自动合成多模态轨迹、生成逐步偏好对并训练视觉语言模型（VLM）控制器以改进工具使用推理。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating
scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at

TL;DR: 提出ReSplat：用渲染误差作为反馈的前馈循环高斯模型，在16×下采样初始化下迭代细化少量3D高斯，达到更快且更优的渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前馈高斯散布方法虽然高效但受限于单次前向传递，难以在测试时自适应和进一步优化表示。通过引入循环更新并利用渲染误差作为信号，能够在保持效率的同时显著提升表现。

Method: 模型包含两部分：1) 一个紧凑的16×下采样重建网络，用于生成初始的稀疏高斯集合（比逐像素方法少16倍）；2) 一个接收渲染误差信号的循环更新网络，该网络在不显式计算梯度的情况下迭代更新高斯参数。渲染误差作为丰富的自监督反馈，允许在测试时适配未知分布。

Result: ReSplat提出一种前馈循环高斯散布(gaussian splatting)模型，通过迭代地在前向推理中细化3D高斯表示来提升渲染质量，同时保持高效性。关键是利用渲染误差作为反馈信号驱动循环网络学习无梯度的高斯更新，从而在测试时自适应未知数据分布。为了高效初始化，引入了在16×下采样空间运行的紧凑重建模型，生成比逐像素高斯少16倍的高斯，从而降低计算开销并加速更新。实验在多视图数量、分辨率和数据集上显示了更少高斯数量下的SOTA性能与更快渲染速度。

Conclusion: ReSplat在减少高斯数量和加速渲染的同时，通过反馈驱动的循环更新实现了更强的泛化和更高的图像质量，达到了在DL3DV与RealEstate10K上的SOTA表现。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Motivation: Ensure QoS (response time) while respecting tenant budgets in multicloud by creating replicas when needed and exploiting provider price diversity

Method: Tenant-centric dynamic replication based on thresholds and heuristic placement

Conclusion: TCDRM能在多云环境中动态创建副本并利用不同云定价以在不超预算的情况下提升性能，实验证明带宽和响应时间大幅改善且符合租户经济约束

Abstract: Multi-cloud computing systems face significant challenges in ensuring
acceptable performance while adhering to tenant budget requirements. This paper
proposes a tenant budget-aware (tenant-centric) data replication framework for
Multi-Cloud Computing (TCDRM). The proposed strategy dynamically creates data
replicas based on predefined thresholds for response time, economic budget of
the tenant and data popularity. TCDRM employs a heuristic replica placement
algorithm that leverages the diverse pricing structures of multiple cloud
providers. The TCDRM strategy aims to maintain the required performance without
exceeding the tenant's budget by taking advantage of the capabilities offered
by multicloud environments. The middleware considered acts as an intermediary
between tenants and multiple cloud providers, facilitating intelligent replica
placement decisions. To achieve this, the proposed TCDRM strategy defines
strict thresholds for tenant budget and response time. A performance evaluation
is conducted to validate the effectiveness of the strategy. The results show
that our approach effectively meets tenant performance objectives while
respecting their economic constraints. Bandwidth consumption is reduced by up
to 78% compared to non-replicated approaches, and average response time for
complex queries is decreased by 51%, all while adhering to tenant budget
limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current moving object DBs are heavy or not production-ready; need lightweight in-memory analytical system with native spatiotemporal support.

Method: Paper describes implementation of MobilityDuck, a DuckDB extension integrating MEOS for spatiotemporal types and operators.

Result: MobilityDuck integrates MEOS into DuckDB, provides native spatiotemporal and temporal types, supports continuous trajectory operators, and outperforms or matches MobilityDB on benchmark while keeping expressiveness.

Conclusion: MobilityDuck successfully combines MEOS spatiotemporal capabilities with DuckDB's lightweight in-memory columnar engine, offering an expressive, efficient alternative to MobilityDB for mobility analytics.

Abstract: The analytics of spatiotemporal data is increasingly important for mobility
analytics. Despite extensive research on moving object databases (MODs), few
systems are ready on production or lightweight enough for analytics. MobilityDB
is a notable system that extends PostgreSQL with spatiotemporal data, but it
inherits complexity of the architecture as well. In this paper, we present
MobilityDuck, a DuckDB extension that integrates the MEOS library to provide
support spatiotemporal and other temporal data types in DuckDB. MobilityDuck
leverages DuckDB's lightweight, columnar, in-memory executable properties to
deliver efficient analytics. To the best of our knowledge, no existing
in-memory or embedded analytical system offers native spatiotemporal types and
continuous trajectory operators as MobilityDuck does. We evaluate MobilityDuck
using the BerlinMOD-Hanoi benchmark dataset and compare its performance to
MobilityDB. Our results show that MobilityDuck preserves the expressiveness of
spatiotemporal queries while benefiting from DuckDB's in-memory, columnar
architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的方法对原始数据和查询强依赖，难以推广到新库，实际部署受限。作者提出利用schema层面的语义来缓解对原始数据和查询模板的依赖，从而提升通用性和可部署性。

Method: 1) 用模式（字段名、类型、约束等）语义来预测列的分布特征；2) 设计模板无关的查询表示方式以减少对查询日志和模板的依赖；3) 在大规模从真实表生成的查询集上进行预训练，冻结参数后可在新库直接使用。

Result: 提出ZeroCard：首个基于schema语义的cardinality estimation方法，无需访问原始数据、查询日志或在目标库上重训练。通过用schema语义预测数据分布、模板无关的查询表示，并在大规模真实表的查询集上预训练，实现在目标库上的直接应用。

Conclusion: ZeroCard展示了用schema语义预测分布并结合查询表示进行预训练的可行性，实验证明其在通用性和部署便利性上的优势，可直接用于查询优化。

Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database systems and plays a
critical role in query optimization. Despite significant advances in
learning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain
difficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw
data or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To
overcome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit
cardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these
dependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven
cardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw
data access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we
propose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding
raw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic
representation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a
large-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard
on it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate
representations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and
applied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to
demonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical
applications in query optimization. Its zero-dependence property significantly
facilitates deployment in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 将block nested loops思想引入语义连接，通过将行批次合并到单次LLM提示中寻找匹配对，提出批次大小优化公式与自适应变体，在理论与实证上显著降低成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic join implementations use nested loops invoking LLMs per row pair, which is costly. Inspired by block nested loops in databases, propose batching rows into a single LLM prompt to find matching pairs, optimizing for LLM context/window constraints.

Method: Block-based semantic joins using LLMs

Result: Introduces formulas to choose batch sizes under context window limits, an adaptive variant when output size is hard to estimate, formal asymptotic cost analysis, and empirical results showing significant cost reductions compared to prior engines.

Conclusion: Block-based LLM joins reduce invocation costs and scale better than pairwise LLM evaluations; adaptive batching handles uncertain output sizes effectively.

Abstract: Semantic query processing engines often support semantic joins, enabling
users to match rows that satisfy conditions specified in natural language. Such
join conditions can be evaluated using large language models (LLMs) that solve
novel tasks without task-specific training.
  Currently, many semantic query processing engines implement semantic joins
via nested loops, invoking the LLM to evaluate the join condition on row pairs.
Instead, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, inspired by the block nested
loops join operator implementation in traditional database systems. The
proposed algorithm integrates batches of rows from both input tables into a
single prompt. The goal of the LLM invocation is to identify all matching row
pairs in the current input. The paper introduces formulas that can be used to
optimize the size of the row batches, taking into account constraints on the
size of the LLM context window (limiting both input and output size). An
adaptive variant of the proposed algorithm refers to cases in which the size of
the output is difficult to estimate. A formal analysis of asymptotic processing
costs, as well as empirical results, demonstrates that the proposed approach
reduces costs significantly and performs well compared to join implementations
used by recent semantic query processing engines.
