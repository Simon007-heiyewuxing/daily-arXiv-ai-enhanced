Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8df3\u8fc7\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u628a\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u878d\u5165\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u623f\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u63a7\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u89e3\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u7684\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u5dee\uff1b\u5c3d\u7ba1\u56fe\u50cf/\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4e0a\u8fdb\u6b65\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e2D\u6216\u5355\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u623f\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4fe1\u606f\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6c42\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0a\u6e32\u67d3\u51fa\u65b0\u5149\u7167\u4e0b\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u89c6\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u65b0\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u4e14\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u56fe\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5ba4\u5185\u5927\u5c3a\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u89e3\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u5149\u7167\u4e0b\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u3002"}}

However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task.

On the Ability of Foundation Models to Recognize Contextually Important Moments", "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u4ee5\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u4e3a\u4f8b\uff09\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bd4\u8d5b\u96c6\u9526\u9690\u542b\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u53d1\u5e03\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4e14\u503e\u5411\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7efc\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d9\u8ff0\u6216\u6458\u8981\u65f6\u5e8f\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9700\u8981\u5148\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u660e\uff0c\u4e14\u624b\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3002\u5229\u7528\u8db3\u7403\u96c6\u9526\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u542b\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u53ef\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0e\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u8db3\u7403\u6bd4\u8d5b\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u96c6\u9526\uff08\u9ad8\u4eae\uff09\u526a\u8f91\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u96c6\u9526\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7247\u6bb5\u4e3a\u201c\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u201d\u3002\u6784\u9020\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u91cd\u8981\u4e0e\u975e\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u8861\u91cf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u6001\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6548\u679c\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533a\u5206\u91cd\u8981/\u975e\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e0a\u63a5\u8fd1\u968f\u673a\u731c\u6d4b\uff08\u63a5\u8fd150%\uff09\uff0c\u8d85\u51fa\u8868\u9762\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u5408\u6210\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u5224\u5b9a\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u96c6\u9526\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6837\u672c\u5c42\u9762\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u4e92\u8865\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u4e0e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u7ed8\u753b\u8868\u9762\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u88c2\u7eb9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCNN+GNN\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5339\u914d\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u5c42\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7ec6\u5316\u548cTPS\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u975e\u521a\u6027\u914d\u51c6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ed8\u753b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5386\u53f2\u6728\u677f\u753b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5f71\u50cf\uff08\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u3001\u7ea2\u5916\u53cd\u7167\u3001\u7d2b\u5916\u8367\u5149\u3001X\u5c04\u7ebf\u3001\u5b8f\u89c2\u6444\u5f71\uff09\u9700\u8981\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u4fbf\u7efc\u5408\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u3002\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5dee\u5f02\u3001\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u975e\u521a\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u5185\u5bb9\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ed9\u914d\u51c6\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08CNN\uff09\u5728\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u57fa\u4e8e\u88c2\u7eb9\u7684\u5173\u952e\u70b9\uff1b2) \u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u5728\u57fa\u4e8epatch\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u63cf\u8ff0\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u5339\u914d\uff1b3) \u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u533a\u57df\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u91cd\u6295\u5f71\u8bef\u5dee\u7b5b\u9009\u5339\u914d\u70b9\uff1b4) \u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u5c42\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8584\u677f\u6837\u6761\uff08TPS\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u521a\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u53d8\u6362\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u914d\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u5927\u91cf\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9762\u677f\u7ed8\u753b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u79cd\u6a21\u6001\u57df\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u5927\u578b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5404\u6a21\u5757\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1b\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u5339\u914d\u53ca\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u914d\u51c6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u88c2\u7eb9\uff08craquelure\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u975e\u521a\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u914d\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u5927\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u975e\u521a\u6027\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

SQL is highly optimized for processing structured data laid out in relations. Meanwhile, in the present application development landscape, it is highly desirable to utilize the power of learned models to perform complex tasks. Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to understand and extract information from unstructured textual data. However, SQL as a query language and accompanying relational database systems are either incompatible or inefficient for workloads that require leveraging learned models. This results in complex engineering and multiple data migration operations that move data between the data sources and the model inference platform. In this paper, we present iPDB, a relational system that supports in-database machine learning (ML) and large language model (LLM) inferencing using extended SQL syntax. In iPDB, LLMs and ML calls can function as semantic projects, as predicates to perform semantic selects and semantic joins, or for semantic grouping in group-by clauses. iPDB has a novel relational predict operator and semantic query optimizations that enable users to write and efficiently execute semantic SQL queries, outperforming the state-of-the-art.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faiPDB\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6269\u5c55SQL\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u539f\u751f\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5e93\u5185\u8c03\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u589e\u7684predict\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06LLM/ML\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6295\u5f71\u3001\u8c13\u8bcd\u3001\u8fde\u63a5\u6216\u5206\u7ec4\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u6267\u884c\u201c\u8bed\u4e49SQL\u201d\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5c24\u5176LLM\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u6216\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u6570\u636e\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u628aML/LLM\u63a8\u7406\u76f4\u63a5\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u653e\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0iPDB\uff1a\u6269\u5c55SQL\u8bed\u6cd5\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5728\u5e93\u5185\u8c03\u7528ML/LLM\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6295\u5f71\uff08semantic project\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8c13\u8bcd\uff08semantic select predicates\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u63a5\uff08semantic joins\uff09\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u7ec4\uff08semantic group-by\uff09\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684relational predict\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u53ca\u4e00\u7ec4\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5199\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5305\u542b\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u8ba1\u5212\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u884c\u6027\u4e0e\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\uff0ciPDB\u5728\u6267\u884c\u542b\u6709LLM/ML\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u663e\u793a\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08state-of-the-art\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u6240\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u5de5\u7a0b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "iPDB\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c06ML/LLM\u63a8\u7406\u539f\u751f\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u3002\u901a\u8fc7predict\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u53ef\u5728SQL\u5c42\u9762\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u5199\u8bed\u4e49\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u89c6\u89d2token\u201d\u2014\u2014\u901a\u8fc7\u8eab\u4f53\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u6216\u65cb\u8f6c\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u53d6\u5411\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLaVA-1.5-13B\u540e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u900f\u89c6\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65cb\u8f6c\u578btoken\u5bf9\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u8003\u8005\u5177\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\uff1b\u5fae\u8c03\u5e76\u672a\u521b\u5efa\u5168\u65b0\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u4ed6\u65b9\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u4e45\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u7f3a\u4e4fallocentric\uff08\u4ed6\u65b9\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5728token\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u8d4b\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u201c\u89c6\u89d2token\u201d\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u8eab\u4f53\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u62bd\u8c61\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9btoken\u96c6\u6210\u5165LLaVA-1.5-13B\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\uff08Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench\uff09\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u68c0\u67e5\u5fae\u8c03\u524d\u540e\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89d2token\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8c\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u62e9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u578btoken\u66f4\u6613\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u8003\u4f53\uff1b\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ece\u96f6\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bf4\u660eMLM\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728allocentric\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u524d\u4f53\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5f53\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89d2token\u5c06\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d6\u5411\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ed6\u65b9\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u62e9\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u5fae\u8c03\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660eMLM\u5177\u5907allocentric\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u524d\u4f53\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5408\u9002\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

This study proposes a four-stage transaction management framework for document-oriented NoSQL databases, with MongoDB as the reference platform. The framework combines transaction lifecycle management, operation classification, pre-execution conflict detection, and an adaptive locking strategy with timeout-based deadlock prevention. Formal correctness analysis shows that the proposed approach guarantees conflict serializability under defined conditions. An experimental evaluation using the Yahoo Cloud Serving Benchmark (YCSB) workloads A, B, and F, with concurrency levels ranging from 1 to 100 clients, demonstrates a reduction in transaction abort rates from 8.3% to 4.7%, the elimination of observed deadlocks, and a 34.2% decrease in latency variance. Throughput improvements ranging from 6.3% to 18.4% are observed under high concurrency, particularly for read-modify-write workloads. Distributed experiments on clusters of up to 9 nodes confirm scalability, achieving 15.2% higher throughput and 53% lower abort rates than baseline systems. Comparisons with MongoDB's native transactions, CockroachDB, and TiDB indicate that the proposed framework strikes a good balance between consistency guarantees and performance overhead. Sensitivity analysis identifies optimal parameter settings, including a lock timeout of 100 ms, an initial backoff of 10 ms, and a maximum backoff of 500 ms. These results show that carefully designed consistency mechanisms can significantly improve data integrity in NoSQL systems without undermining scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6267\u884c\u51b2\u7a81\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8d85\u65f6\u9501\u7684\u56db\u9636\u6bb5\u4e8b\u52a1\u7ba1\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728MongoDB\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e2d\u6b62\u7387\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u5e76\u53d1/\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u541e\u5410\u91cf", "motivation": "NoSQL\u7cfb\u7edf\u666e\u904d\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u7ec8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6216\u5f31\u4e8b\u52a1\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8b\u52a1\u5904\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd", "method": "Four-stage transaction management framework for MongoDB: lifecycle mgmt, operation classification, pre-execution conflict detection, adaptive locking with timeout-based deadlock prevention", "result": "Reduced abort rates (8.3% -> 4.7%), no observed deadlocks, 34.2% decrease in latency variance; throughput +6.3% to +18.4% under high concurrency; distributed: +15.2% throughput, -53% abort; compared favorably to MongoDB native, CockroachDB, TiDB", "conclusion": "Framework can improve consistency and performance trade-off in document-oriented NoSQL systems under evaluated workloads and parameter settings"}}

While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability.

Despite three decades of standardization efforts, over 40 metadata schemas now span the building lifecycle, with fragmentation accelerating rather than resolving. Current approaches rely on point-to-point mappings that scale quadratically with the number of schemas, or universal ontologies that become unwieldy monoliths. The fundamental gap is the absence of mathematical foundations for structure-preserving transformations across heterogeneous building data. Here we show that category theory provides these foundations, enabling systematic data integration with $O(n)$ specification complexity for $n$ ontologies. We formalize building ontologies as first-order theories and demonstrate two proof-of-concept implementations in Categorical Query Language (CQL): 1) generating BRICK models from IFC design data at commissioning, and 2) three-way integration of IFC, BRICK, and RealEstateCore where only two explicit mappings yield the third automatically through categorical composition. Our correct-by-construction approach treats property sets as first-class schema entities and provides automated bidirectional migrations, and enables cross-ontology queries. These results establish feasibility of categorical methods for building data integration and suggest a path toward an app ecosystem for buildings, where mathematical foundations enable reliable component integration analogous to smartphone platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7528\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u548cCQL\u5bf9IFC\u3001BRICK\u3001RealEstateCore\u7b49\u672c\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u6620\u5c04\u53ca\u53cc\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u4ea7\u751f\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u70b9\u5bf9\u70b9\u5e73\u65b9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6210\u4e3a\u7b28\u91cd\u901a\u7528\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u672c\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u7684\u51fd\u5b50/\u81ea\u7136\u53d8\u6362/\u590d\u5408\u7b49\u6982\u5ff5\u5728CQL\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\uff1aIFC\u5230BRICK\u7684\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caIFC\u3001BRICK\u3001RealEstateCore\u7684\u4e09\u65b9\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u5bf9\u6620\u5c04\u81ea\u52a8\u5f97\u5230\u7b2c\u4e09\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5efa\u7b51\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5efa\u7b51\u672c\u4f53\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u9636\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Categorical Query Language(CQL)\u5b9e\u73b0\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8303\u7574\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u5c06\u672c\u4f53\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u6307\u5b9a\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u81f3O(n)\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u6784\u9020\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8fc1\u79fb\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u96c6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u7b49\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u8de8\u672c\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u9886\u57df\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors.

Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation. Built on these components, \\model implements a coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization, entropy-guided point discovery, vision-based validation, and mask decoding.

However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCSRNet\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5947\u5076\u5f02\u6784\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u4e92\u8865\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u91cd\u542f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e0eSOTA\u7ade\u4e89\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u867d\u80fd\u5206\u5c42\u63d0\u53d6\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u6240\u83b7\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4ecd\u662f\u8d85\u5206\u7684\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5947\u5757\u548c\u5076\u5757\u4e24\u7c7b\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u5757\u4ee5\u6269\u5927\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ebf\u6027\u4e0e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u540c\u6e90\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u5e76\u4f34\u968fwarm restart\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCSRNet\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6765\u81ea\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\uff0cCSRNet\u80fd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u63d0\u53d6\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e92\u8865\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d85\u5206\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation under complex scenarios. \\href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/InfraredSmallTargetDetection-IRSTD.DCCS}{DCCS-Det Official Code is Available Here!}", "AI": {"tldr": "DCCS-Det \u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230 SOTA \u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u7a00\u91ca\u9020\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u517c\u987e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u957f\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u5e76\u7ef4\u6301\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 DSE \u5757\uff08\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\u4ee5\u6355\u83b7\u957f\u7a0b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ec6\u8282\uff09\u548c LaSEA \u6a21\u5757\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6c60\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7f13\u89e3\u7279\u5f81\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5224\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668 DCCS-Det\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u6d41\u663e\u8457\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff08DSE\uff09\u5757\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u805a\u5408\uff08LaSEA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6539\u5584\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "DCCS-Det \u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e DSE \u4e0e LaSEA \u5747\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often face the gradual degradation of target edge pixels as the number of network layers increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate between frequency components during feature extraction, leading to low-frequency backgrounds interfering with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise triggering false detections. To address these limitations, we propose MDAFNet (Multi-scale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection), which integrates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSDE module, through a multi-scale edge extraction and enhancement mechanism, effectively compensates for the cumulative loss of target edge information during downsampling. The DAFE module combines frequency domain processing mechanisms with simulated frequency decomposition and fusion mechanisms in the spatial domain to effectively improve the network's capability to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets and selectively suppress high-frequency noise.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone.

Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities.

Existing methods predominantly focus on designing complex architectures to fit local data distributions. However, they often overlook the long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity inherent in limited data, thereby struggling to distinguish between few-shot or confusing categories. In the process of knowledge dissemination in the human world, individuals will actively seek expert assistance to transcend the limitations of local thinking. Inspired by this, we introduce an external \"Domain Expert\" and propose an Expert Knowledge-Guided Classification Decision Calibration Network (EKDC-Net) to overcome these challenges. Our framework addresses two core issues: expert knowledge extraction and utilization. Specifically, we first develop a Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM). By leveraging Class Activation Map (CAM) analysis, LPKEM guides the domain expert to focus exclusively on discriminative features essential for classification. Subsequently, to effectively integrate this knowledge, we design an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM). This module dynamically corrects the local model's decisions by considering both overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, we present a large-scale classification dataset covering 102 tree species, named CU-Tree102 to address the issue of scarce diversity in current benchmarks.

In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation.

However, generating a complete 360\u00b0 scene from a single image remains a highly ill-posed and challenging problem. Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360\u00b0 scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner.

We extend this paradigm to the semi-supervised setting, enabling the use of large-scale, uncurated datasets containing a mixture of known and unknown classes to improve the hierarchical open-set performance. To this end, we propose a teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling. Two key components are introduced: 1) subtree pseudo-labels, which provide reliable supervision in the presence of unknown data, and 2) age-gating, a mechanism that mitigates overconfidence in pseudo-labels.

Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency.

However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion.

Synthetic facial images offer a potential solution, yet existing generative models often struggle to balance realism, diversity, and identity preservation. This paper presents SCHIGAND, a novel synthetic face generation pipeline integrating StyleCLIP, HyperStyle, InterfaceGAN, and Diffusion models to produce highly realistic and controllable facial datasets. SCHIGAND enhances identity preservation while generating realistic intra-class variations and maintaining inter-class distinctiveness, making it suitable for biometric testing. The generated datasets were evaluated using ArcFace, a leading facial verification model, to assess their effectiveness in comparison to real-world facial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHIGAND achieves a balance between image quality and diversity, addressing key limitations of prior generative models.

Experiments on the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenges (BraTS 2017 and BraTS 2023) demonstrate competitive accuracy, well-calibrated uncertainty, and an 87% reduction in FLOPs, underscoring the potential of SNNs for reliable, low-power medical IoT and Point-of-Care systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSNN\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528FPTT\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728BraTS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u826f\u597d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ca\u7ea687% FLOPs \u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5c06\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684SNN\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53ef\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e14\u9002\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u6216\u7269\u8054\u7f51/\u5e8a\u8fb9\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u5e38\u89c4ANN\u5728\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u96c6\u6210\uff08\u77e2\u72b6\u9762\u3001\u51a0\u72b6\u9762\u3001\u8f74\u72b6\u9762\uff09\u7684SNN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0e\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5272\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528FPTT\uff08Forward Propagation Through Time\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u5e8f\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff1b3) \u5728BraTS2017\u548cBraTS2023\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea687%\u7684FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SNN\u5728\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u533b\u7597\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNN\uff09\u76843D\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u517c\u987e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0e\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728BraTS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies.

However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.\n  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning.

This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory.

As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components.

Climate change-induced temperature fluctuations are exacerbating stress on road pavements, resulting in elevated maintenance costs. This underscores the need for targeted and efficient maintenance strategies. This study investigates the potential of open-source data to guide highway infrastructure maintenance. The proposed framework integrates airborne imagery and OpenStreetMap (OSM) to fine-tune YOLOv11 for highway crack localization. To demonstrate the framework's real-world applicability, a Swiss Relative Highway Crack Density (RHCD) index was calculated to inform nationwide highway maintenance. The crack classification model achieved an F1-score of $0.84$ for the positive class (crack) and $0.97$ for the negative class (no crack). The Swiss RHCD index exhibited weak correlations with Long-term Land Surface Temperature Amplitudes (LT-LST-A) (Pearson's $r\\ = -0.05$) and Traffic Volume (TV) (Pearson's $r\\ = 0.17$), underlining the added value of this novel index for guiding maintenance over other data.

Earlier studies on 3D human pose lifting from 2D often contain incorrect-yet-overconfident 3D estimations. To mitigate the problem, emerging probabilistic approaches treat the 3D estimations as a distribution, taking into account the uncertainty measurement of the poses. Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. The 2D lifting condition is modeled via graph convolutional networks, leveraging the learnable connections between human body joints as the graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared to diffusion-based methods, the FMPose with optimal transport produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations.

In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep.

Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "CASP\u901a\u8fc7\u5728CLS token\u7684Q/K/V\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u7c7b\u5171\u4eab\u504f\u7f6e\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u4e0e\u6d41\u5f62Token Mixup\uff0c\u5728FSCIL\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8eSOTA\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u589e\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u4f1a\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7c7b\u522b\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0cCLS token\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7b5b\u9009\u673a\u5236\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u63a7CLS\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6765\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65e0\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e0a\u52a0\u5165\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u5e38\u89c4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0cCASP\u5728CLS token\u7684Q/K/V\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u52a0\u5165\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u7f6e\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u5f71\u54cd\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6270\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u5e76\u5728\u6d45\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u5f62Token Mixup\u4ee5\u5408\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u65b0\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0e\u50a8\u5907\u8868\u793a\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728CUB200\u3001CIFAR100\u548cImageNet-R\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6FSCIL\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cCASP\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u589e\u91cf\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u4e14\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCASP\uff08CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728CLS token\u7684query\u3001key\u3001value\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7c7b\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u8c03\u63a7\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u9636\u6bb5\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e14\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7c7b\u522b\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9FSCIL\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points.

To address these shortcomings, we propose REL-SF4PASS with our REL depth representation based on cylindrical coordinate and Spherical-dynamic Multi-Modal Fusion SMMF. REL is made up of Rectified Depth, Elevation-Gained Vertical Inclination Angle, and Lateral Orientation Angle, which fully represents 3D space in cylindrical coordinate style and the surface normal direction. SMMF aims to ensure the diversity of fusion for different panoramic image regions and reduce the breakage of cylinder side surface expansion in ERP projection, which uses different fusion strategies to match the different regions in panoramic images.

This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9+\u773c\u52a8\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652fCNN-LSTM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528224\u4e2a\u5ba4\u5185\u89c6\u9891\u548c28\u4eba\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5bf915\u4e2a\u7f8e\u5b66\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff1a\u5ba2\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea672.2%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea666.8%\uff0c\u773c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u7279\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6548\u679c\u4e14\u90e8\u7f72\u4ec5\u9700\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u3002", "motivation": "\u5ba4\u5185\u7a7a\u95f4\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4ef7\u4e3b\u89c2\u4e14\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u773c\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u89c2\u770b\u8005\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u751f\u7406\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u5bf9\u5ba1\u7f8e\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u5e78\u798f\u611f\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7f51\u7edc\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u652f\u91c7\u7528CNN\u63d0\u53d6\u5e27\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u773c\u52a8\u5206\u652f\u7528LSTM\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51dd\u89c6\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u77b3\u5b54\u7b49\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e24\u8def\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7ef4\u7f8e\u5b66\u5224\u522b\u3002\u6570\u636e\u662f224\u4e2a\u5ba4\u5185\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c6\u9891\u4e0e28\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6ce8\u89c6\u6570\u636e\u548c15\u7ef4\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u3001\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0e\u4e3b/\u5ba2\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5ba2\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u5149\u7167\uff09\u4e0a\u8fbe72.2%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u653e\u677e\u611f\uff09\u4e0a66.8%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u663e\u793a\u77b3\u5b54\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4ef7\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6ce8\u89c6\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4ef7\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u773c\u52a8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec5\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7c7b\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u773c\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652fCNN-LSTM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4f\u5b85\u5ba4\u5185\u7684\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5ba2\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u738772.2%\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a66.8%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u773c\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\u53ef\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4ec5\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance).

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels.

However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance.

While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay.

In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies.

We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination.

In this work, we introduce \\textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \\emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \\textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \\emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \\emph{any} viewpoint.
