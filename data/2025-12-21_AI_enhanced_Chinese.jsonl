This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": ""}}

In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faThe Perceptual Observatory\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30MLLM\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0e\u6270\u52a8\u63ed\u793a\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed1\u5b9a\u4e0e\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dMLLM\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u590d\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u5224\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u662f\u5426\u6e90\u81ea\u89c6\u89c9\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u4ec5\u9760\u6587\u672c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u5782\u76f4\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4eba\u8138\u5339\u914d\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u6587\u5b57\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5339\u914d\u3001\u7f51\u683c\u6307\u70b9\u3001\u5c5e\u6027\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u5730\u9762\u5b9e\u6d4b\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u8fdb\u884c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u589e\u6270\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u5e7b\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\uff1b\u5728\u4e0d\u540cMMLL\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u6d4b\u91cf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3001\u5f52\u56e0\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u53ca\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "The Perceptual Observatory\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d85\u8d8a\u699c\u5355\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u8bc4\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u53ca\u5176\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0a\u7684\u8584\u5f31\u73af\u8282\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ed1\u5b9a\u3002"}}

While effective on small databases, this approach fails on real-world schemas that exceed LLM context limits, even for commercial models. The recent Spider 2.0 benchmark exemplifies this with hundreds of tables and tens of thousands of columns, where existing systems often break. Current mitigations either rely on costly multi-step prompting pipelines or filter columns by ranking them against user's question independently, ignoring inter-column structure. To scale existing systems, we introduce \\toolname, an open-source, LLM-efficient schema filtering framework that compacts Text2SQL prompts by (i) ranking columns with a query-aware LLM encoder enriched with values and metadata, (ii) reranking inter-connected columns via a lightweight graph transformer over functional dependencies, and (iii) selecting a connectivity-preserving sub-schema with a Steiner-tree heuristic. Experiments on real datasets show that \\toolname achieves near-perfect recall and higher precision than CodeS, SchemaExP, Qwen rerankers, and embedding retrievers, while maintaining sub-second median latency and scaling to schemas with 23,000+ columns.

However, the limited availability of annotated multispectral data severely restricts the training of deep detectors. In such data-scarce scenarios, textual class information can serve as a valuable source of semantic supervision. Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings.

The corpus is built from Hugging Face model cards, GitHub READMEs, and referenced papers, linking each table to its surrounding model and publication context. Compared with open data lake tables, model tables are smaller yet exhibit denser inter table relationships, reflecting tightly coupled model and benchmark evolution. The current release covers over 60K models and 90K tables. To evaluate model and table relatedness, we construct a multi source ground truth using three complementary signals: (1) paper citation links, (2) explicit model card links and inheritance, and (3) shared training datasets. We present one extensive empirical use case for the benchmark which is table search. We compare canonical Data Lake search operators (unionable, joinable, keyword) and Information Retrieval baselines (dense, sparse, hybrid retrieval) on this benchmark. Union based semantic table retrieval attains 54.8 % P@1 overall (54.6 % on citation, 31.3 % on inheritance, 30.6 % on shared dataset signals); table based dense retrieval reaches 66.5 % P@1, and metadata hybrid retrieval achieves 54.1 %. This evaluation indicates clear room for developing better table search methods. By releasing ModelTables and its creation protocol, we provide the first large scale benchmark of structured data describing AI model. Our use case of table discovery in Model Lakes, provides intuition and evidence for developing more accurate semantic retrieval, structured comparison, and principled organization of structured model knowledge.

Earles"], "title": "Are vision-language models ready to zero-shot replace supervised classification models in agriculture?", "comment": "Draft version", "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions for visual recognition tasks, yet their reliability for agricultural decision support remains poorly understood. We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u572827\u4e2a\u519c\u4e1a\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLM\u666e\u904d\u663e\u8457\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u7684YOLO11\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\uff08Gemini-3 Pro\uff09\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ea662%\uff0c\u800c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u539f\u59cb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u4f4e\u4e8e25%\u3002\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u5b9a\u53ef\u5c06\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u6392\u540d\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2dQwen-VL-72B\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u4f46\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u9876\u7ea7\u4e13\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u690d\u682a/\u6742\u8349\u8bc6\u522b\u76f8\u5bf9\u5bb9\u6613\uff0c\u5bb3\u866b/\u635f\u4f24\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u96be\u3002\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5f53\u524dVLM\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u519c\u4e1a\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u73b0\u6210VLM\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5176\u80fd\u5426\u66ff\u4ee3\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u4f20\u7edf\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5728AgML\u96c6\u5408\u768427\u4e2a\u519c\u4e1a\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08162\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u6e90\u4e0e\u95ed\u6e90VLM\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165LLM\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u5b9a\u6765\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\uff1b\u4e0e\u6709\u76d1\u7763YOLO11\u57fa\u7ebf\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u6309\u4efb\u52a1\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u690d\u7269\u75be\u75c5\u3001\u5bb3\u866b/\u635f\u4f24\u3001\u690d\u7269/\u6742\u8349\u79cd\u7c7b\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5206\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u96f6\u6837\u672cVLM\u666e\u904d\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8eYOLO11\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u793a\u4e0bGemini-3 Pro\u5e73\u5747\u7ea662%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u63d0\u793a\u539f\u59cb\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u901a\u5e38<25%\uff0c\u7ecfLLM\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u5b9a\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u4ece21%\u523030%\uff09\u3002\u5f00\u6e90\u6700\u4f73Qwen-VL-72B\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd1\u95ed\u6e90\u8868\u73b0\u4f46\u4ecd\u843d\u540e\u3002\u690d\u7269/\u6742\u8349\u5206\u7c7b\u8f83\u6613\uff0c\u5bb3\u866b/\u635f\u4f24\u6700\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u73b0\u6210VLM\u5c1a\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u8bca\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u754c\u9762\u3001\u660e\u786e\u6807\u7b7e\u672c\u4f53\u548c\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ca\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

We define Origin (O), Destination (D), and Time (T ) patterns (ODT patterns) and propose a bottom-up algorithm that enumerates them. We suggest and employ optimizations that greatly reduce the search space and the computational cost of pattern enumeration. We also propose pattern variants (constrained patterns and top-k patterns) that could be useful to differ- ent applications scenarios.

While sampling from explicit lists is well-understood, modern applications -- such as machine learning over relational data -- often require sampling from a set defined implicitly by a relational join. In this paper, we study the problem of \\emph{subset sampling over joins}: drawing a random subset from the join results, where each join result is included independently with some probability. We address the general setting where the probability is derived from input tuple weights via decomposable functions (e.g., product, sum, min, max). Since the join size can be exponentially larger than the input, the naive approach of materializing all join results to perform subset sampling is computationally infeasible. We propose the first efficient algorithms for subset sampling over acyclic joins: (1) a \\emph{static index} for generating multiple (independent) subset samples over joins; (2) a \\emph{one-shot} algorithm for generating a single subset sample over joins; (3) a \\emph{dynamic index} that can support tuple insertions, while maintaining a one-shot sample or generating multiple (independent) samples.

(2) One-shot algorithm produces a single subset sample without full index by traversing join tree with probabilistic decisions, using reservoir-like or recursive sampling to avoid materialization. (3) Dynamic index supports insertions by updating local structures and maintaining samples using localized resampling or lazy updates; can also output multiple independent samples.

Adversarial interaction is an effective method to generate such safety-critical corner cases.

To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases.

This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions.

We select OPMT for this role because of its fast convergence, which allows it to rapidly generate an intermediate solution that successfully achieves basis material decomposition. Subsequently, in the data-driven phase, we introduce a novel neural network, ResDynUNet++, to refine this intermediate solution. The ResDynUNet++ is built upon a UNet++ backbone by replacing standard convolutions with residual dynamic convolution blocks, which combine the adaptive, input-specific feature extraction of dynamic convolution with the stable training of residual connections.

Recent advances have demonstrated the significant potential of 2D foundation models for low-shot 3D part segmentation. However, it is still an open problem that how to effectively aggregate 2D knowledge from foundation models to 3D. Existing methods either ignore geometric structures for 3D feature learning or neglects the high-quality grouping clues from SAM, leading to under-segmentation and inconsistent part labels. We devise a novel SAM segment graph-based propagation method, named SegGraph, to explicitly learn geometric features encoded within SAM's segmentation masks. Our method encodes geometric features by modeling mutual overlap and adjacency between segments while preserving intra-segment semantic consistency. We construct a segment graph, conceptually similar to an atlas, where nodes represent segments and edges capture their spatial relationships (overlap/adjacency). Each node adaptively modulates 2D foundation model features, which are then propagated via a graph neural network to learn global geometric structures. To enforce intra-segment semantic consistency, we map segment features to 3D points with a novel view-direction-weighted fusion attenuating contributions from low-quality segments. Extensive experiments on PartNet-E demonstrate that our method outperforms all competing baselines by at least 6.9 percent mIoU. Further analysis reveals that SegGraph achieves particularly strong performance on small components and part boundaries, demonstrating its superior geometric understanding.

To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding.

Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faVALOR\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff08GRPO\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Med-VLM\u5728\u4ea4\u53c9\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u68c0\u7d22/\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u7528\u8bed\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVALOR\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO)\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a1\uff09\u4ee5\u6587\u672c\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u5316Med-VLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u8f93\u51fa\u672f\u8bed\u66f4\u4e34\u5e8a\u7cbe\u51c6\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6295\u5f71\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0e\u75be\u75c5\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bf1\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVALOR\u8f83\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "VALOR\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u653e\u5c04\u5b66\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Unlike fixed common categories for plants or animals, ad-hoc categories are created dynamically to serve specific goals. We study open ad-hoc categorization: Given a few labeled exemplars and abundant unlabeled data, the goal is to discover the underlying context and to expand ad-hoc categories through semantic extension and visual clustering around it.\n  Building on the insight that ad-hoc and common categories rely on similar perceptual mechanisms, we propose OAK, a simple model that introduces a small set of learnable context tokens at the input of a frozen CLIP and optimizes with both CLIP's image-text alignment objective and GCD's visual clustering objective.\n  On Stanford and Clevr-4 datasets, OAK achieves state-of-the-art in accuracy and concept discovery across multiple categorizations, including 87.4% novel accuracy on Stanford Mood, surpassing CLIP and GCD by over 50%. Moreover, OAK produces interpretable saliency maps, focusing on hands for Action, faces for Mood, and backgrounds for Location, promoting transparency and trust while enabling adaptive and generalizable categorization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faOAK\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587tokens\u63a5\u5165\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684CLIP\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u6587\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u805a\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c+\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4e34\u65f6\u5206\u7c7b\uff08open ad-hoc categorization\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u663e\u8457\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u5e38\u9700\u4e34\u65f6\u521b\u5efa\u6ee1\u8db3\u5f53\u524d\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u201cad-hoc\u201d\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5728\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u793a\u4f8b\u4e14\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u81ea\u52a8\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u6269\u5c55\u5e76\u4ee5\u89c6\u89c9\u805a\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOAK\uff1a\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u7aef\u52a0\u5165\u4e00\u5c0f\u7ec4\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587tokens\uff0c\u51bb\u7ed3CLIP\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u2014\u2014CLIP\u7684\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u4e0eGCD\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u805a\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\uff08\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec4\u7fa4\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u6b64\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7a7a\u95f4\u540c\u65f6\u63a8\u52a8\u7c7b\u522b\u6269\u5c55\u4e0e\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728Stanford\u548cClevr-4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cOAK\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6982\u5ff5\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbeSOTA\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u5728Stanford Mood\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65b0\u7c7b\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe87.4%\uff0c\u8f83CLIP\u4e0eGCD\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc750%\u3002\u6b64\u5916\u751f\u6210\u7684\u663e\u8457\u56fe\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u5408\u7406\u533a\u57df\uff08\u52a8\u4f5c\u805a\u7126\u624b\u90e8\u3001\u60c5\u7eea\u805a\u7126\u9762\u90e8\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u805a\u7126\u80cc\u666f\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u8868\u793a\uff08CLIP\uff09\u524d\u52a0\u5165\u5c11\u91cf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u805a\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\uff0cOAK\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u4e34\u65f6\u5206\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c+\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff08GMM\uff09\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u6709\u754c\u6027\u4e14\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u5bf9\u79f0KL\uff08MSKL\uff09\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u5f62\u72b6\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u5728\u4e24\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u73b0\u6709KL\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "motivation": "\u70b9\u4e91\u65e0\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u8868\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08Hausdorff/Chamfer\uff09\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u6574\u4f53\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b\u73b0\u6709GMM\u7684KL\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u754c\u6216\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u503c\uff0c\u9700\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u6574\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8bc1\u660eGMM\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u6210\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9a\u4e49\u4fee\u6539\u5bf9\u79f0KL\uff08MSKL\uff09\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5176\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u62df\u5408\u4e3aGMM\u5e76\u5728\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97MSKL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6bd4\u8f83\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4ee5\u68c0\u9a8c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u3002", "result": "MSKL\u5728MPI-FAUST\uff08\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u5224\u522b\uff09\u548cG-PCD\uff08\u52a8\u7269\u5f62\u72b6\u6bd4\u8f83\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u51e0\u4f55\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eHausdorff\u3001Chamfer\u548c\u73b0\u6709KL\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff08\u5982\u8fd1\u4f3cKL\u6216\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "MSKL\u4e3a\u70b9\u4e91\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u754c\u4e14\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u3002"}}

It has been observed that in diffusion models, certain high-quality initial noise patterns lead to better generation results than others. However, there remains a lack of dedicated learning frameworks that enable NVS models to learn such high-quality noise. To obtain high-quality initial noise from random Gaussian noise, we make the following contributions. First, we design a discretized Euler inversion method to inject image semantic information into random noise, thereby constructing paired datasets of random and high-quality noise. Second, we propose a learning framework based on an encoder-decoder network (EDN) that directly transforms random noise into high-quality noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed EDN can be seamlessly plugged into various NVS models, such as SV3D and MV-Adapter, achieving significant performance improvements across multiple datasets.

However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u76ee\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u5c11\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u5e94\u5927\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e94\u4e0d\u5927\u4e8e\u5c11\u89c6\u89d2\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u878d\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8ba1\u6570\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u636e\u96be\u4ee5\u6536\u96c6\u4e0e\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6837\u672c\u6709\u9650\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6216\u66f4\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u9009\u62e9\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6269\u5145\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7ea6\u675f\uff1a1) Vanilla\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u5bf9\u540c\u4e00\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u91cf\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5c11\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2) \u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u65f6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u968f\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u589e\u52a0\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0d\u589e\u5927\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u9879\u4e0e\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8ba1\u6570\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u52a0\u5165\u9884\u6d4b\u503c\u6216\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6392\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8ba1\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u6570\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u89d2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4eba\u7fa4\u8ba1\u6570\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faFLIM_PSR_k\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ecGAN\u7684\u591a\u901a\u9053\u50cf\u7d20\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u50cf\u7d20\u653e\u5927\u81f35\u500d\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8FLIM\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u96c6\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff0c\u63a8\u65ad\u5feb\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f2\u6d4b\u663e\u793a\u5728\u75c5\u4eba\u6765\u6e90\u80bf\u7624\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0k=5\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u591a\u9879\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "FLIM\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u50cf\u7d20\u505c\u7559\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u548c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387-\u901f\u5ea6\u6743\u8861\u6bd4\u5e38\u89c4\u5149\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u66f4\u4e25\u82db\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u52a0\u5feb\u91c7\u96c6\u548c\u6539\u5584SNR\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u8f6c\u5316\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u901a\u9053\u50cf\u7d20\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u6846\u67b6FLIM_PSR_k\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc(cGAN)\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u50cf\u7d20\u653e\u5927\u81f35\u500d\uff09FLIM\u6570\u636e\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u4e0e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0ccGAN\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u75c5\u4eba\u6765\u6e90\u80bf\u7624\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7684\u76f2\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0cFLIM_PSR_k\u5728k=5\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b025\u500d\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e26\u5bbd\u79ef\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u51fa\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u3002", "conclusion": "FLIM_PSR_k\u53ef\u63d0\u5347FLIM\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u52a0\u5feb\u6210\u50cf\u3001\u7f13\u89e3SNR\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u4f4eNA\u4e0e\u5fae\u578b\u5316\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8FLIM\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f6c\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration.

While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.", "AI": {"tldr": "GFLAN\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u8ba1\u5212\uff08\u623f\u95f4\u8d28\u5fc3\u5206\u914d\uff09\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\uff08Transformer\u589e\u5f3aGNN\u56de\u5f52\u8fb9\u754c\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5efa\u7b51\u62d3\u6251\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6355\u6349\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u50cf\u7d20\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u65f6\uff0c\u7ec4\u5408\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5efa\u7b51\u63a8\u7406\u5982\u62d3\u6251\u4f18\u5148\u6027\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGFLAN\uff1a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u9636\u6bb5A\u7528\u53cc\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\uff08\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u53d8\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0e\u5e03\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u884c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u914d\u623f\u95f4\u8d28\u5fc3\uff1b\u9636\u6bb5B\u6784\u5efa\u5c06\u623f\u95f4\u8282\u70b9\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u9876\u70b9\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u878d\u5408Transformer\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8054\u5408\u56de\u5f52\u623f\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5916\u754c\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u524d\u95e8\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u529f\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u5f0f\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u56de\u5f52\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e03\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u8fde\u901a\u6027\uff08\u8bba\u6587\u62a5\u544a\u4e86\u5728\u5408\u6210\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u50cf\u7d20\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u5b9e\u73b0\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\uff0cGFLAN\u80fd\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u5efa\u7b51\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, these approaches still face two challenges when dealing with time-varying degradations. First, the degradation can dominate temporal modeling, confusing the model to focus on artifacts rather than the video content. Second, current methods typically rely on large models to handle all-in-one restoration, concealing those underlying difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight all-in-one video restoration network, LaverNet, with only 362K parameters. To mitigate the impact of degradations on temporal modeling, we introduce a novel propagation mechanism that selectively transmits only degradation-agnostic features across frames. Through LaverNet, we demonstrate that strong all-in-one restoration can be achieved with a compact network. Despite its small size, less than 1\\% of the parameters of existing models, LaverNet achieves comparable, even superior performance across benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLaverNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\uff08362K\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5168\u80fd\u4fee\u590d\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5728\u5e27\u95f4\u4f20\u9012\u4e0e\u9000\u5316\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u51cf\u8f7b\u65f6\u53d8\u9000\u5316\u5bf9\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4ee5\u8fdc\u5c0f\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6bd4\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u4fee\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u53d8\u9000\u5316\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9000\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u5e8f\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u4f2a\u5f71\u800c\u975e\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\uff1b\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u578b\u7f51\u7edc\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u96be\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u6a21\u578b\u660e\u786e\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLaverNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5362K\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u3002\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\uff08propagation\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5e27\u95f4\u4f20\u9012\u4e0e\u9000\u5316\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u9000\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u5e72\u6270\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u805a\u5408\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u7684\u5168\u80fd\u4fee\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53c2\u6570\u5c11\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u76841%\uff0cLaverNet\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u53ef\u6bd4\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0e\u7d27\u51d1\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u65f6\u53d8\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4f20\u9012\u9000\u5316\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f20\u64ad\u673a\u5236\uff0cLaverNet\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u5e38\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5927\u4e00\u4f53\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u5173\u6ce8\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u5197\u4f59\u53bb\u9664\u3002"}}

In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8fb9\u7f18-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5148\u7528\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5168\u5c40\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u627eROI\u4e0e\u6700\u5c0f\u71b5\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u8bf7\u6c42\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u4f20\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5230\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u4f20\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u5148\u5bf9\u5168\u5c40\u7f29\u653e\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b9a\u4f4dROI\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u71b5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u8861\u91cf\uff1b\u82e5\u6700\u5c0f\u71b5\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u5219\u8bf7\u6c42\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u53d1\u9001\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aVLM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u91cd\u4f20\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u91cd\u4f20\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684ROI\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u71b5\u7684\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5224\u5b9a\uff0c\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e26\u5bbd\u8282\u7701\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7f18-\u4e91\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy.

However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness.

In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling.

To address this challenge, we propose the Adaptive Frequency Domain Alignment Network (AFDAN)--a novel domain adaptation framework designed to align features in the frequency domain and alleviate data scarcity. AFDAN integrates three core components to enable robust cross-domain knowledge transfer: an Adversarial Domain Learning Module that transfers features from the source to the target domain; a Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module that blends frequency representations across domains; and a Spatial-Frequency Integration Module that combines both frequency and spatial features to further enhance segmentation accuracy across domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AFDAN: it achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 90.9% for vitiligo segmentation in the newly constructed VITILIGO2025 dataset and a competitive IoU of 82.6% on the retinal vessel segmentation benchmark DRIVE, surpassing existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAFDAN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9891\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u57df\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6e90-\u76ee\u6807\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a-\u9891\u7387\u96c6\u6210\u4e09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3002VITILIGO2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aVitiligo IoU 90.9%\uff0cDRIVE\u8840\u7ba1\u5206\u5272IoU 82.6%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u6602\u8d35\uff0c\u57df\u95f4\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "AFDAN\u7531\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u7ec4\u6210\uff1a1) \u5bf9\u6297\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\uff08Adversarial Domain Learning Module\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06\u6e90\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u57df\uff1b2) \u6e90-\u76ee\u6807\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08Source-Target Frequency Fusion Module\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u9891\u57df\u6df7\u5408\u4e24\u57df\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b3) \u7a7a\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u5757\uff08Spatial-Frequency Integration Module\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u9891\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u6574\u4f53\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9891\u57df\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5206\u5272\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684VITILIGO2025\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAFDAN\u5728\u767d\u765c\u98ce\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230IoU 90.9%\u3002\u5728DRIVE\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u8840\u7ba1\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97IoU 82.6%\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9891\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8de8\u57df\u878d\u5408\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9891\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cAFDAN\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u57df\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

Our approach utilizes Gaussian Splatting, since it is more explicit and thus more amenable to constraints than NeRFs. We leverage segmentation annotations to align the semantic regions of the face, facilitating the reconstruction of a neutral pose from only 11 images (as opposed to requiring a long video). We soft constrain the Gaussians to an underlying triangulated surface in order to provide a more structured Gaussian Splat reconstruction, which in turn informs subsequent perturbations to increase the accuracy of the underlying triangulated surface. The resulting triangulated surface can then be used in a standard graphics pipeline. In addition, and perhaps most impactful, we show how accurate geometry enables the Gaussian Splats to be transformed into texture space where they can be treated as a view-dependent neural texture. This allows one to use high visual fidelity Gaussian Splatting on any asset in a scene without the need to modify any other asset or any other aspect (geometry, lighting, renderer, etc.) of the graphics pipeline. We utilize a relightable Gaussian model to disentangle texture from lighting in order to obtain a delit high-resolution albedo texture that is also readily usable in a standard graphics pipeline. The flexibility of our system allows for training with disparate images, even with incompatible lighting, facilitating robust regularization.

BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling.

Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars.

We focus on the well-studied behaviour of priming an object/location for pick up or put down -- that is, the spotting of an object/location from a distance, known as gaze priming, followed by the motion of approaching and reaching the target location. To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric.

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide open-world semantic priors, they lack grounding in 3D geometry and temporal dynamics. Conversely, geometric perception captures structure and motion but remains semantically sparse. We propose SNOW (Scene Understanding with Open-World Knowledge), a training-free and backbone-agnostic framework for unified 4D scene understanding that integrates VLM-derived semantics with point cloud geometry and temporal consistency. SNOW processes synchronized RGB images and 3D point clouds, using HDBSCAN clustering to generate object-level proposals that guide SAM2-based segmentation. Each segmented region is encoded through our proposed Spatio-Temporal Tokenized Patch Encoding (STEP), producing multimodal tokens that capture localized semantic, geometric, and temporal attributes. These tokens are incrementally integrated into a 4D Scene Graph (4DSG), which serves as 4D prior for downstream reasoning. A lightweight SLAM backend anchors all STEP tokens spatially in the environment, providing the global reference alignment, and ensuring unambiguous spatial grounding across time. The resulting 4DSG forms a queryable, unified world model through which VLMs can directly interpret spatial scene structure and temporal dynamics. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks demonstrate that SNOW enables precise 4D scene understanding and spatially grounded inference, thereby setting new state-of-the-art performance in several settings, highlighting the importance of structured 4D priors for embodied reasoning and autonomous robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSNOW\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u3001\u9aa8\u5e72\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06VLM\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u76844D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eHDBSCAN\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u63d0\u8bae\u3001SAM2\u5206\u5272\u3001STEP\u7f16\u7801\u548cSLAM\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u5728\u591a\u9879\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLM\u7f3a\u4e4f3D\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u800c\u7eaf\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u7a00\u5c11\uff0c\u4e8c\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8f93\u5165\u540c\u6b65RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HDBSCAN\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u7ea7\u63d0\u8bae\u5e76\u5f15\u5bfcSAM2\u5206\u5272\uff1b\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u5272\u533a\u91c7\u7528STEP\uff08\u65f6\u7a7a\u6807\u8bb0\u5316\u8865\u4e01\u7f16\u7801\uff09\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001token\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b\u9010\u6b65\u5c06token\u96c6\u6210\u51654D\u573a\u666f\u56fe\uff084DSG\uff09\uff1b\u8f7b\u91cfSLAM\u540e\u7aef\u4e3aSTEP token\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u5c40\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u5b9a\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u65e0\u6b67\u4e49\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSNOW\u57284D\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u951a\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u591a\u9879\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6210\u7ee9\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ed3\u6784\u53164D\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u5177\u8eab\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SNOW\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u65f6\u7a7a\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u67e5\u8be2\u76844D\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faStageVAR\uff1a\u4fdd\u7559\u65e9\u671f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u5bf9\u665a\u671f\u6b65\u9aa4\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6700\u9ad83.4x\u63d0\u901f\u4e14\u8d28\u91cf\u4ec5\u5c0f\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "VAR\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u6025\u5267\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u9009\u62e9\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e14\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5404\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u65e9\u671f\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u5bf9\u665a\u671f\u6b65\u9aa4\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u526a\u679d\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u65b9\u6848\u4e3aplug-and-play\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "StageVAR\u901a\u8fc7\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5bf9Visual Autoregressive\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u6b65\u9aa4\u5e76\u5bf9\u540e\u671f\u7ec6\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u91c7\u7528\u526a\u679d\u548c\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9636\u6bb5\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0cStageVAR\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u52a0\u901f\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA).

Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains.

Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance.

Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications.

The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faPoseMoE\uff1a\u7528Mixture-of-Experts\u5206\u79bb2D\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u4e13\u5bb6\u805a\u5408\u63d0\u9ad8\u5355\u76ee3D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edflifting\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edflifting\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u76842D\u59ff\u6001\u4e0e\u672a\u77e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f1a\u6c61\u67d32D\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u82e5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5148\u88ab\u7f51\u7edc\u7c97\u4f30\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u518d\u4e0e2D\u5171\u540c\u7f16\u7801\u5219\u6709\u5229\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5148\u533a\u5206\u5904\u7406\u5e76\u4e13\u95e8\u5b66\u4e60\u6df1\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "Mixture-of-Experts for monocular 3D pose (PoseMoE).

VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks.

This paper introduces MAGINet, a Multi-scale Attention-Guided Intrinsics Network that predicts a $512\\times512$ light-normalized diffuse albedo map from a single RGB portrait. MAGINet employs hierarchical residual encoding, spatial-and-channel attention in a bottleneck, and adaptive multi-scale feature fusion in the decoder, yielding sharper albedo boundaries and stronger lighting invariance than prior U-Net variants. The initial albedo prediction is upsampled to $1024\\times1024$ and refined by a lightweight three-layer CNN (RefinementNet). Conditioned on this refined albedo, a Pix2PixHD-based translator then predicts a comprehensive set of five additional physically based rendering passes: ambient occlusion, surface normal, specular reflectance, translucency, and raw diffuse colour (with residual lighting). Together with the refined albedo, these six passes form the complete intrinsic decomposition. Trained with a combination of masked-MSE, VGG, edge, and patch-LPIPS losses on the FFHQ-UV-Intrinsics dataset, the full pipeline achieves state-of-the-art performance for diffuse albedo estimation and demonstrates significantly improved fidelity for the complete rendering stack compared to prior methods.

Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy.

Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning.

However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faCausal-Tune\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u9891\u57df\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u5206\u79bbVFM\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u6210\u5206\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7DCT\u63d0\u53d6\u9891\u8c31\u3001\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u679ctoken\u5e76\u4e22\u5f03\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u9006DCT\u56de\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u671f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u542b\u6709\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4f2a\u5f71\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u56e0\u7d20\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u4f4e\u9ad8\u9891\u8c31\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8f7b\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u57df\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "Causal-Tune\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5bf9\u6bcf\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u505aDCT\u5f97\u5230\u9891\u8c31\uff1b\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u5e26\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5c06\u9891\u8c31\u5206\u6210\u56e0\u679c\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u4fdd\u7559\u56e0\u679c\u9891\u6bb5\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u56e0\u679c\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60token\u5728\u9891\u57df\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7cbe\u70bc\uff1b\u4e22\u5f03\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u9891\u6bb5\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u9006DCT\u56de\u5230\u7a7a\u95f4\u57df\u5e76\u4f20\u9012\u81f3\u4e0b\u4e00\u5c42\u3002\u4ec5\u5fae\u8c03\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u9891\u57dftoken\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8de8\u57df\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u505a\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u3002\u793a\u4f8b\uff1a\u5728\u96ea\u5929\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u8f83\u57fa\u7ebfmIoU\u63d0\u5347\u7ea64.8%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u9891\u57df\u4e0a\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u6210\u5206\uff0cCausal-Tune\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5229\u7528VFM\u4e2d\u6709\u7528\u8868\u5f81\u3001\u63d0\u9ad8\u672a\u77e5\u57df\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks.

Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently.

One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites.

While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality.

However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning.

Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "FrameDiffuser \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528 G-buffer \u4e0e\u4e0a\u4e00\u5e27\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 ControlNet \u4e0e ControlLoRA \u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u9010\u5e27\u6269\u6563\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u9002\u914d\u73af\u5883\u4e13\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9010\u5e27\u72ec\u7acb\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4e3a\u5168\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e76\u9700\u5b8c\u6574\u5e8f\u5217\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9010\u5e27\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa FrameDiffuser\uff0c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u8f93\u5165\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u5e27 G-buffer\uff08\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u3001\u8868\u9762\u5c5e\u6027\uff09\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5e27\uff0c\u53cc\u91cd\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528 ControlNet \u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784/\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528 ControlLoRA \u63d0\u4f9b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u73af\u5883\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u6362\u53d6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e13\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cFrameDiffuser \u5728\u5149\u7167\u3001\u9634\u5f71\u4e0e\u53cd\u5c04\u7684\u5199\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u901a\u7528 RGBX\uff08\u9010\u5e27\uff09\u4e0e DiffusionRenderer\uff08\u5168\u89c6\u9891\u4f46\u6602\u8d35\uff09\u7b49\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9002\u914d\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6570\u767e\u5230\u6570\u5343\u5e27\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "FrameDiffuser \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408 ControlNet \u548c ControlLoRA\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6bcf\u5e27\u4f7f\u7528 G-buffer \u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e27\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u91cd\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u9002\u7528\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u6570\u767e\u5230\u6570\u5343\u5e27\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u5149\u7167\u903c\u771f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u573a\u666f\u4e13\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5149\u7167\u3001\u9634\u5f71\u4e0e\u53cd\u5c04\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u4f7f\u7528ResNet-50\u4e0e\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u635f\u5931\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6307\u7eb9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728ChestXray-14\u548cBraTS-2021\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u7684Recall@K\uff08\u598220-way 1-shot\u7ea699%\uff09\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5408\u5e76\u591a\u4e2a\u5f00\u6e90\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u65f6\uff0c\u540c\u4e00\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u5207\u7247\u4e2d\uff0c\u82e5\u4e0d\u53bb\u91cd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3/\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3001\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u4f30\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4fdd\u969c\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528ResNet-50\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528triplet margin loss\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c06\u540c\u4e00\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u62c9\u8fd1\u3001\u4e0d\u540c\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u63a8\u8fdc\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u91c7\u7528few-shot\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff08\u5982N-way K-shot\uff09\uff0c\u57282D\u80f8\u7247\u548c3D MRI\u5207\u7247\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728ChestXray-14\u4e0a\uff0c20-way 1-shot Recall@K\u8fbe99.10%\uff0c500-way 5-shot\u8fbe90.06%\uff1b\u5728BraTS-2021\u4e0a\uff0c20-way 1-shot\u8fbe99.20%\uff0c100-way 3-shot\u8fbe98.86%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u3001\u591a\u7c7b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u201csubject fingerprinting\u201d\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5c06\u540c\u4e00\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u7684\u5f71\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u9760\u8fd1\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u53d7\u8bd5\u8005\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u5408\u5e76\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6cc4\u6f0f\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The study leverages multiple datasets spanning diverse generators, mask sizes, and inpainting techniques.

Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam.

Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods.

Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks.

This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets.

Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following.

However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage.

However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability.

These predictive modules serve exclusively as training-time supervision through depth-based rendering, while inference requires only lightweight additional query tokens without invoking any 3D decoding.

Marius Z\u00f6llner"], "title": "DenseBEV: Transforming BEV Grid Cells into 3D Objects", "comment": "15 pages, 8 figures, accepted by WACV 2026", "summary": "In current research, Bird's-Eye-View (BEV)-based transformers are increasingly utilized for multi-camera 3D object detection. Traditional models often employ random queries as anchors, optimizing them successively. Recent advancements complement or replace these random queries with detections from auxiliary networks. We propose a more intuitive and efficient approach by using BEV feature cells directly as anchors. This end-to-end approach leverages the dense grid of BEV queries, considering each cell as a potential object for the final detection task. As a result, we introduce a novel two-stage anchor generation method specifically designed for multi-camera 3D object detection. To address the scaling issues of attention with a large number of queries, we apply BEV-based Non-Maximum Suppression, allowing gradients to flow only through non-suppressed objects. This ensures efficient training without the need for post-processing. By using BEV features from encoders such as BEVFormer directly as object queries, temporal BEV information is inherently embedded. Building on the temporal BEV information already embedded in our object queries, we introduce a hybrid temporal modeling approach by integrating prior detections to further enhance detection performance. Evaluating our method on the nuScenes dataset shows consistent and significant improvements in NDS and mAP over the baseline, even with sparser BEV grids and therefore fewer initial anchors. It is particularly effective for small objects, enhancing pedestrian detection with a 3.8% mAP increase on nuScenes and an 8% increase in LET-mAP on Waymo. Applying our method, named DenseBEV, to the challenging Waymo Open dataset yields state-of-the-art performance, achieving a LET-mAP of 60.7%, surpassing the previous best by 5.4%.

However, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) systems - such as Multimodal AI for Radiology Applications (MAIRA-2) and Medical Pathways Language Model-Multimodal (MedPaLM-M) - depend on large-scale multimodal training, clinical metadata, and multiple imaging views, making them resource-intensive and inaccessible for most settings. We introduce a compact image-to-text architecture that generates the Findings section of chest X-ray reports from a single frontal image. The model combines a frozen Self-Distillation with No Labels v3 (DINOv3) Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2 (GPT-2) decoder enhanced by layer-wise anatomical attention. This mechanism integrates lung and heart segmentation masks through hierarchical Gaussian smoothing, biasing attention toward clinically relevant regions without adding trainable parameters. Evaluated on the official Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-Chest X-ray (MIMIC-CXR) dataset using Chest Radiograph Expert (CheXpert) and Radiology Graph (RadGraph) metrics, our approach achieved substantial gains: CheXpert Macro-F1 for five key pathologies increased by 168% (0.083 -> 0.238) and Micro-F1 by 146% (0.137 -> 0.337), while broader performance across 14 observations improved by 86% (0.170 -> 0.316).

We show that benchmark drift is a significant problem for GenEval, one of the most popular T2I benchmarks. Although GenEval was well-aligned with human judgment at the time of its release, it has drifted far from human judgment over time -- resulting in an absolute error of as much as 17.7% for current models. This level of drift strongly suggests that GenEval has been saturated for some time, as we verify via a large-scale human study. To help fill this benchmarking gap, we introduce a new benchmark, GenEval 2, with improved coverage of primitive visual concepts and higher degrees of compositionality, which we show is more challenging for current models. We also introduce Soft-TIFA, an evaluation method for GenEval 2 that combines judgments for visual primitives, which we show is more well-aligned with human judgment and argue is less likely to drift from human-alignment over time (as compared to more holistic judges such as VQAScore).

However, training state-of-the-art models remains notoriously difficult, with current approaches often struggling to balance robustness against true imperceptibility. This work introduces Pixel Seal, which sets a new state-of-the-art for image and video watermarking. We first identify three fundamental issues of existing methods: (i) the reliance on proxy perceptual losses such as MSE and LPIPS that fail to mimic human perception and result in visible watermark artifacts; (ii) the optimization instability caused by conflicting objectives, which necessitates exhaustive hyperparameter tuning; and (iii) reduced robustness and imperceptibility of watermarks when scaling models to high-resolution images and videos. To overcome these issues, we first propose an adversarial-only training paradigm that eliminates unreliable pixel-wise imperceptibility losses. Second, we introduce a three-stage training schedule that stabilizes convergence by decoupling robustness and imperceptibility. Third, we address the resolution gap via high-resolution adaptation, employing JND-based attenuation and training-time inference simulation to eliminate upscaling artifacts. We thoroughly evaluate the robustness and imperceptibility of Pixel Seal on different image types and across a wide range of transformations, and show clear improvements over the state-of-the-art. We finally demonstrate that the model efficiently adapts to video via temporal watermark pooling, positioning Pixel Seal as a practical and scalable solution for reliable provenance in real-world image and video settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Pixel Seal uses adversarial-only training, a three-stage decoupled schedule, and JND-based high-res adaptation to produce more imperceptible and robust watermarks for images and videos.", "motivation": "Current watermarking models struggle to balance robustness with imperceptibility, suffer from unstable optimization due to conflicting losses, and don't scale well to high-resolution images/videos.", "method": "Adversarial-only training replacing pixel losses; three-stage training decoupling objectives; high-resolution adaptation using JND attenuation and inference simulation; temporal watermark pooling for video.", "result": "Pixel Seal achieves state-of-the-art invisible watermarking with improved imperceptibility and robustness.", "conclusion": "Adversarial-only training, three-stage schedule, and high-resolution adaptation enable stable training and better performance; temporal pooling extends to video."}}

While SAM3 provides a powerful spatio-temporal framework for video object segmentation, its performance in surgical scenes is limited by indiscriminate memory updates, fixed memory capacity, and weak identity recovery after occlusions. We propose ReMeDI-SAM3, a training-free memory-enhanced extension of SAM3, that addresses these limitations through three components: (i) relevance-aware memory filtering with a dedicated occlusion-aware memory for storing pre-occlusion frames, (ii) a piecewise interpolation scheme that expands the effective memory capacity, and (iii) a feature-based re-identification module with temporal voting for reliable post-occlusion identity disambiguation. Together, these components mitigate error accumulation and enable reliable recovery after occlusions. Evaluations on EndoVis17 and EndoVis18 under a zero-shot setting show absolute mcIoU improvements of around 7% and 16%, respectively, over vanilla SAM3, outperforming even prior training-based approaches.

Existing methods for estimating such physical material parameters from visual data assume homogeneous single-material objects, pre-learned dynamics, or simplistic topologies. Real-world objects, however, are often complex in material composition and geometry lying outside the realm of these assumptions. In this paper, we particularly focus on flowers as a representative common object. We introduce Multi-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs) to estimate the material composition and parameters of such multi-material complex natural objects from video. From a short video captured in a natural setting, M-PhyGs jointly segments the object into similar materials and recovers their continuum mechanical parameters while accounting for gravity. M-PhyGs achieves this efficiently with newly introduced cascaded 3D and 2D losses, and by leveraging temporal mini-batching. We introduce a dataset, Phlowers, of people interacting with flowers as a novel platform to evaluate the accuracy of this challenging task of multi-material physical parameter estimation. Experimental results on Phlowers dataset demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of M-PhyGs and its components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faM-PhyGs\uff0c\u4ece\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6750\u6599\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u673a\u68b0\u53c2\u6570\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u8c61\uff08\u82b1\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9bPhlowers\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u635f\u5931\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f30\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u7269\u4f53\u901a\u5e38\u7531\u591a\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u7ec4\u6210\u4e14\u5f62\u72b6\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u4f30\u8ba1\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u5355\u4e00\u6750\u6599\u6216\u5df2\u77e5\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u7136\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6750\u6599\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u6750\u6599\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u6062\u590d\u6bcf\u79cd\u6750\u6599\u7684\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u51faMulti-material Physical Gaussians (M-PhyGs)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u6750\u6599\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u6062\u590d\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u7ea7\u8054\u76843D\u548c2D\u635f\u5931\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4-\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\uff08temporal mini-batching\uff09\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u8003\u8651\u91cd\u529b\u5f71\u54cd\u4ee5\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u6a21\u62df\u7269\u4f53\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "M-PhyGs\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u5b8c\u6210\u591a\u6750\u6599\u5206\u5272\u4e0e\u8fde\u7eed\u529b\u5b66\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u82b1\uff09\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u6062\u590d\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ea7\u8054\u76843D\u548c2D\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u53ca\u65f6\u95f4\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Phlowers\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728Phlowers\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cM-PhyGs\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5206\u5272\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u5047\u8bbe\u5355\u4e00\u6750\u6599\u6216\u9884\u5b66\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, deploying VLLMs for downstream tasks such as video recommendation remains challenging, since real systems require multi-video inputs, lightweight backbones, low-latency sequential inference, and rapid response. In practice, (1) decode-only generation yields high latency for sequential inference, (2) typical interfaces do not support multi-video inputs, and (3) constraining outputs to language discards fine-grained visual details that matter for downstream vision tasks. We argue that these limitations stem from the absence of a representation that preserves pixel-level detail while leveraging world knowledge. We present LinkedOut, a representation that extracts VLLM world knowledge directly from video to enable fast inference, supports multi-video histories, and removes the language bottleneck. LinkedOut extracts semantically grounded, knowledge-aware tokens from raw frames using VLLMs, guided by promptable queries and optional auxiliary modalities. We introduce a cross-layer knowledge fusion MoE that selects the appropriate level of abstraction from the rich VLLM features, enabling personalized, interpretable, and low-latency recommendation.

However, these 2D methods often compromise 3D consistency and speed, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios, such as digital twins or telepresence. In contrast, 3D-aware facial animation feedforward methods -- built upon explicit 3D representations, such as neural radiance fields or Gaussian splatting -- ensure 3D consistency and achieve faster inference speed, but come with inferior expression details. In this paper, we aim to combine their strengths by distilling knowledge from a 2D diffusion-based method into a feed-forward encoder, which instantly converts an in-the-wild single image into a 3D-consistent, fast yet expressive animatable representation. Our animation representation is decoupled from the face's 3D representation and learns motion implicitly from data, eliminating the dependency on pre-defined parametric models that often constrain animation capabilities. Unlike previous computationally intensive global fusion mechanisms (e.g., multiple attention layers) for fusing 3D structural and animation information, our design employs an efficient lightweight local fusion strategy to achieve high animation expressivity. As a result, our method runs at 107.31 FPS for animation and pose control while achieving comparable animation quality to the state-of-the-art, surpassing alternative designs that trade speed for quality or vice versa.

This paper presents FlashPortrait, an end-to-end video diffusion transformer capable of synthesizing ID-preserving, infinite-length videos while achieving up to 6x acceleration in inference speed. In particular, FlashPortrait begins by computing the identity-agnostic facial expression features with an off-the-shelf extractor. It then introduces a Normalized Facial Expression Block to align facial features with diffusion latents by normalizing them with their respective means and variances, thereby improving identity stability in facial modeling. During inference, FlashPortrait adopts a dynamic sliding-window scheme with weighted blending in overlapping areas, ensuring smooth transitions and ID consistency in long animations. In each context window, based on the latent variation rate at particular timesteps and the derivative magnitude ratio among diffusion layers, FlashPortrait utilizes higher-order latent derivatives at the current timestep to directly predict latents at future timesteps, thereby skipping several denoising steps and achieving 6x speed acceleration.

However, their performance is fundamentally limited by the quality of training data. Web-crawled and synthetic image datasets often contain low-quality or redundant samples, which lead to degraded visual fidelity, unstable training, and inefficient computation. Hence, effective data selection is crucial for improving data efficiency. Existing approaches rely on costly manual curation or heuristic scoring based on single-dimensional features in Text-to-Image data filtering. Although meta-learning based method has been explored in LLM, there is no adaptation for image modalities. To this end, we propose **Alchemist**, a meta-gradient-based framework to select a suitable subset from large-scale text-image data pairs. Our approach automatically learns to assess the influence of each sample by iteratively optimizing the model from a data-centric perspective. Alchemist consists of two key stages: data rating and data pruning. We train a lightweight rater to estimate each sample's influence based on gradient information, enhanced with multi-granularity perception. We then use the Shift-Gsampling strategy to select informative subsets for efficient model training. Alchemist is the first automatic, scalable, meta-gradient-based data selection framework for Text-to-Image model training.

However, existing diffusion-based approaches are often trained on paired data of simple editing operations, which fundamentally limits their ability to generalize to diverse and complex, real-world instructions. To address this generalization gap, we propose VIVA, a scalable framework for instruction-based video editing that leverages VLM-guided encoding and reward optimization. First, we introduce a VLM-based instructor that encodes the textual instruction, the first frame of the source video, and an optional reference image into visually-grounded instruction representations, providing fine-grained spatial and semantic context for the diffusion transformer backbone. Second, we propose a post-training stage, Edit-GRPO, which adapts Group Relative Policy Optimization to the domain of video editing, directly optimizing the model for instruction-faithful, content-preserving, and aesthetically pleasing edits using relative rewards.

This requires a compact, semantically rich scene representation that captures where objects are, how they function, and which parts are actionable. Scene graphs are a natural choice, yet prior work often separates spatial and functional relations, treats scenes as static snapshots without object states or temporal updates, and overlooks information most relevant for accomplishing the current task. To address these limitations, we introduce MomaGraph, a unified scene representation for embodied agents that integrates spatial-functional relationships and part-level interactive elements. However, advancing such a representation requires both suitable data and rigorous evaluation, which have been largely missing. We thus contribute MomaGraph-Scenes, the first large-scale dataset of richly annotated, task-driven scene graphs in household environments, along with MomaGraph-Bench, a systematic evaluation suite spanning six reasoning capabilities from high-level planning to fine-grained scene understanding. Built upon this foundation, we further develop MomaGraph-R1, a 7B vision-language model trained with reinforcement learning on MomaGraph-Scenes. MomaGraph-R1 predicts task-oriented scene graphs and serves as a zero-shot task planner under a Graph-then-Plan framework.

Code is available at https://github.com/Neur-IO/SFTok", "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal models highlight the pivotal role of image tokenization in high-resolution image generation. By compressing images into compact latent representations, tokenizers enable generative models to operate in lower-dimensional spaces, thereby improving computational efficiency and reducing complexity. Discrete tokenizers naturally align with the autoregressive paradigm but still lag behind continuous ones, limiting their adoption in multimodal systems. To address this, we propose \\textbf{SFTok}, a discrete tokenizer that incorporates a multi-step iterative mechanism for precise reconstruction. By integrating \\textbf{self-forcing guided visual reconstruction} and \\textbf{debias-and-fitting training strategy}, SFTok resolves the training-inference inconsistency in multi-step process, significantly enhancing image reconstruction quality. At a high compression rate of only 64 tokens per image, SFTok achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality on ImageNet (rFID = 1.21) and demonstrates exceptional performance in class-to-image generation tasks (gFID = 2.29).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSFTok\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26\u591a\u6b65\u81ea\u9a71\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u53bb\u504f\u62df\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u79bb\u6563tokenizer\uff1b\u572864 token/\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0ImageNet rFID=1.21\u4e0egFID=2.29\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u6563tokenizer\u4e0e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u4f46\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0a\u843d\u540e\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eedtokenizer\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53ef\u7f29\u5c0f\u5dee\u8ddd\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165multi-step iterative reconstruction\u3001self-forcing guided visual reconstruction\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u62df\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53cadebias-and-fitting\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316token\u8868\u793a\u548c\u91cd\u5efa\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "result": "SFTok\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u79bb\u6563tokenizer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7self-forcing\u548cdebias-and-fitting\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0cSFTok\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u79bb\u6563tokenizer\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

We explore a data-in-the-loop paradigm from the view of both data construction and framework design. We collect a large-scale dataset by combining public datasets, high-quality synthetic data from our UE5 simulator and text-to-image models, and real panoramic images from the web. To reduce domain gaps between indoor/outdoor and synthetic/real data, we introduce a three-stage pseudo-label curation pipeline to generate reliable ground truth for unlabeled images. For the model, we adopt DINOv3-Large as the backbone for its strong pre-trained generalization, and introduce a plug-and-play range mask head, sharpness-centric optimization, and geometry-centric optimization to improve robustness to varying distances and enforce geometric consistency across views. Experiments on multiple benchmarks (e.g., Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D, and Deep360) demonstrate strong performance and zero-shot generalization, with particularly robust and stable metric predictions in diverse real-world scenes.

However, producing 3D videos remains costly and complex, while automatic Monocular-to-Stereo conversion is hindered by the limitations of the multi-stage ``Depth-Warp-Inpaint'' (DWI) pipeline. This paradigm suffers from error propagation, depth ambiguity, and format inconsistency between parallel and converged stereo configurations. To address these challenges, we introduce UniStereo, the first large-scale unified dataset for stereo video conversion, covering both stereo formats to enable fair benchmarking and robust model training. Building upon this dataset, we propose StereoPilot, an efficient feed-forward model that directly synthesizes the target view without relying on explicit depth maps or iterative diffusion sampling. Equipped with a learnable domain switcher and a cycle consistency loss, StereoPilot adapts seamlessly to different stereo formats and achieves improved consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoPilot significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and computational efficiency.

However, existing open-source models often exhibit blind tool-use reasoning patterns, invoking vision tools even when they are unnecessary, which significantly increases inference overhead and degrades model performance. To this end, we propose AdaTooler-V, an MLLM that performs adaptive tool-use by determining whether a visual problem truly requires tools. First, we introduce AT-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts reward scales based on the Tool Benefit Score of each sample, encouraging the model to invoke tools only when they provide genuine improvements. Moreover, we construct two datasets to support training: AdaTooler-V-CoT-100k for SFT cold start and AdaTooler-V-300k for RL with verifiable rewards across single-image, multi-image, and video data.

However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed multi-view visual inputs. We first extract visual features for each image using a DINO backbone, and employ alternating intra-view local attention, cross-view spatial attention, and cross-frame temporal attention to infer geometric relations across images. We then use multiple heads to decode a global point map in the ego coordinate of the first frame and the ego poses for each frame. Unlike conventional methods that rely on precise camera parameters, DVGT is free of explicit 3D geometric priors, enabling flexible processing of arbitrary camera configurations. DVGT directly predicts metric-scaled geometry from image sequences, eliminating the need for post-alignment with external sensors. Trained on a large mixture of driving datasets including nuScenes, OpenScene, Waymo, KITTI, and DDAD, DVGT significantly outperforms existing models on various scenarios.

Once trained, the auditor uncovers diverse, interpretable exemplars that reveal model weaknesses and serve as annotation-free data for rectification. When applied to SoTA models like Gemma-3 and PaliGemma-2, AuditDM discovers more than 20 distinct failure types.

Instead of training models to output features for downstream use, we train them to generate embeddings to perform predictive tasks directly. This work explores such a shift from learning representations to learning models. Specifically, models learn to predict future patch embeddings conditioned on past ones, using causal masking and stop gradient, which we refer to as Next-Embedding Predictive Autoregression (NEPA). We demonstrate that a simple Transformer pretrained on ImageNet-1k with next embedding prediction as its sole learning objective is effective - no pixel reconstruction, discrete tokens, contrastive loss, or task-specific heads. This formulation retains architectural simplicity and scalability, without requiring additional design complexity. NEPA achieves strong results across tasks, attaining 83.8% and 85.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with ViT-B and ViT-L backbones after fine-tuning, and transferring effectively to semantic segmentation on ADE20K.

Single-image refocusing is still difficult. It involves recovering sharp content and creating realistic bokeh. Current methods have significant drawbacks. They need all-in-focus inputs, depend on synthetic data from simulators, and have limited control over aperture. We introduce Generative Refocusing, a two-step process that uses DeblurNet to recover all-in-focus images from various inputs and BokehNet for creating controllable bokeh. Our main innovation is semi-supervised training. This method combines synthetic paired data with unpaired real bokeh images, using EXIF metadata to capture real optical characteristics beyond what simulators can provide. Our experiments show we achieve top performance in defocus deblurring, bokeh synthesis, and refocusing benchmarks. Additionally, our Generative Refocusing allows text-guided adjustments and custom aperture shapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGenerative Refocusing\uff1a\u7528DeblurNet\u6062\u590d\u5168\u5bf9\u7126\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7528BokehNet\u5408\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u6563\u666f\uff1b\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u914d\u5bf9\u4e0e\u5e26EXIF\u7684\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6563\u666f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5728\u82e5\u5e72\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9886\u5148\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5149\u5708\u3002", "motivation": "\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u805a\u7126\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u6e05\u6670\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u6563\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5168\u5bf9\u7126\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5149\u5708\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e0d\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u5149\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1) DeblurNet\u8d1f\u8d23\u4ece\u5404\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u542b\u6563\u7126\uff09\u6062\u590d\u5168\u5bf9\u7126\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2) BokehNet\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u63a7\u5149\u5708\u53c2\u6570\u751f\u6210\u6563\u666f\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u91c7\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7528\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6563\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff08\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408EXIF\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u57df\u9002\u914d\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u771f\u5b9e\u5149\u5b66\u6a21\u7cca\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5149\u5708\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53bb\u6563\u7126\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u6563\u666f\u5408\u6210\u4e0e\u91cd\u805a\u7126\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b\u989d\u5916\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u8c03\u6574\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u6563\u666f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3001\u6837\u5f0f\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5149\u5708\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Generative Refocusing\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DeblurNet\u548cBokehNet\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u805a\u7126\u4e2d\u7684\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6563\u666f\u5408\u6210\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5408\u6210\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5e26EXIF\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u672a\u914d\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6563\u666f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u5149\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u5149\u5708\u5f62\u72b6\u3002"}}
